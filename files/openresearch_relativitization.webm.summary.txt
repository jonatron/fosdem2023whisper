The speaker, Adrian, presented their project, Relativization, at the FOSDEM conference in 2023. Adrian, who is a PhD candidate from LIDEN University, discussed their interstellar social simulation framework and turn-based strategy game. Adrian explained that they initially began their career in physics, but their research forced them to appreciate computers and open source software. Adrian then decided to switch their field and pursue social science, specifically social modeling, simulation, and data analysis. Adrian's project aims to explore the potential social structures and dynamics of interstellar civilizations through simulation. They explained that their framework is unique because it incorporates the effects of special relativity on social simulations. Adrian presented several examples of models they built using their framework, including a flocking model and a knowledge dynamics model. They also shared that they are developing a game based on the framework, which will explore various elements of interstellar society, such as economics, politics, and scientific research. Adrian discussed the challenges they faced during the development of their project, including the lack of open-source culture in their workplace and time constraints due to their PhD studies. Despite these challenges, Adrian emphasized the value of meaningful and educational exploration and expressed that they feel their time during the pandemic was well spent. Adrian closed by encouraging attendees to check out their project and engage with the open-source community.
