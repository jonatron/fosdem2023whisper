00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
Yeah. It's great to have a packed room here. Really good to see you all. Yeah. Welcome

00:10.400 --> 00:15.760
again. Welcome to the Railways and Open Transport Deaf Room. We want to show you today something

00:15.760 --> 00:23.400
what we are working on, what you are working on, what we all are working on. And the co-organizers

00:23.400 --> 00:29.720
of this Deaf Room Army. I am Cornelius Schumacher. I am working for Deutsche Bahn. I am in the

00:29.720 --> 00:35.360
open source community for a long time and I am really happy to expand my horizon here.

00:35.360 --> 00:41.040
So, Max Mehl, who is also on the picture here, he can be here with us. Some of you might

00:41.040 --> 00:46.760
know him. Yeah. But, Mahalia is here. So, please introduce yourself. Thank you, Cornelius.

00:46.760 --> 00:52.120
Yeah. My name is Mahalia Stefan. I am from SBB, the Swiss Federal Railways and I am responsible

00:52.120 --> 00:58.040
for digitalization and for the business driven open source projects we are just going to

00:58.040 --> 01:06.840
explore. Hi. My name is Simon Clavier. I am from the French Railway S&CF. I am trying

01:06.840 --> 01:14.880
to spread open source in the group for 10 years now. This is a good result so far. I

01:14.880 --> 01:24.680
am very happy to be there and I am very happy to meet you. Yeah. So, just a few introductory

01:24.680 --> 01:32.160
words, introductory slides to set the stage for what we are doing today. We already showed

01:32.160 --> 01:37.960
you we are coming from train companies and we met basically in an initiative to create

01:37.960 --> 01:44.960
an open rail foundation. So, and space for railway companies or companies, organizations

01:44.960 --> 01:50.360
in the railway sector to collaborate via open source to work on open source. That is a missing

01:50.360 --> 01:54.200
piece yet. There is nothing like that yet and we are building that. So, we are really

01:54.200 --> 02:01.120
happy to do that. It is not done yet. So, we are in the process of creating it but it

02:01.120 --> 02:06.960
will be there soon. There is a website. You see the URL on the slide. There is some more

02:06.960 --> 02:11.560
information. The idea is to really spread open source in the railway and that is where

02:11.560 --> 02:16.840
we all personally stand behind and what we want to spread and hopefully some of you who

02:16.840 --> 02:25.240
are related to this topic as well join us in this effort. While we are doing that, of

02:25.240 --> 02:30.640
course, the core of that is the openness, being open, doing open source software. That

02:30.640 --> 02:36.480
is why we are all here. That is why an event like FOSSTEM is happening. For us, it is a

02:36.480 --> 02:41.360
little bit more than just the open source license. It is also about an open collaboration

02:41.360 --> 02:46.240
model. So, having open governance and for the open rail foundation specifically, of

02:46.240 --> 02:52.120
course, the goal is to enable open collaboration in the railway sector. But we do not want

02:52.120 --> 02:59.960
to stop at railways. That is also because transport is more than just going on a train.

02:59.960 --> 03:06.720
We also have to get through the train and everything. So, open transport expands the

03:06.720 --> 03:12.720
domain. Also, topic-wise, the main topic today is open source software. But of course, also

03:12.720 --> 03:18.640
open data, open APIs, they are very important in this space as well. So, this all comes

03:18.640 --> 03:25.280
together in a bigger picture. We do want to talk about more than just railways. We also

03:25.280 --> 03:30.120
want to cover public transport, basically, but want to be open. Because in the end, it

03:30.120 --> 03:35.640
is about the future of mobility. How do we move around? And how do we do that, in a way,

03:35.640 --> 03:41.400
which does not destroy the planet? So, I think that is one of the underlying motivations

03:41.400 --> 03:47.080
for many of us. It is about sustainable transport. It is about creating the means of transportation,

03:47.080 --> 03:53.480
which will serve us for the next decades and millennia and whatever. We cannot do that

03:53.480 --> 03:59.720
alone, of course. That is why we do it together and we want to create things together. That

03:59.720 --> 04:03.840
is why we built the open rail foundation. That is why we do something like the step

04:03.840 --> 04:10.160
room. I hope we can get into contact with many people, that we can build bridges, that

04:10.160 --> 04:15.440
maybe some of the bubbles we are all in, we can connect. And we also would like to follow

04:15.440 --> 04:21.600
up with you later. So, if you need anything, if you want to continue a discussion, we are

04:21.600 --> 04:27.160
happy to try to facilitate that. We do not have a channel for that yet, but we will create

04:27.160 --> 04:34.520
one if there is interest and also support that. So, we want to create together, do open

04:34.520 --> 04:39.120
source together, bring the openness into the railway, into the transport sector, continue

04:39.120 --> 04:43.040
with what is happening there, support the people who are there. And that is why we are

04:43.040 --> 04:51.560
here. And we are not alone. We have a great lineup of speakers. A lot of interesting presentations

04:51.560 --> 04:58.080
and the problem is pretty packed. So, I am really excited to see what is happening today

04:58.080 --> 05:08.240
and that we see a lot of interesting content. Thanks for being here. I think we will dive

05:08.240 --> 05:15.680
in right into the content and start with the first presentation. So, please join me here

05:15.680 --> 05:22.000
on the stage and we just switch over the laptops and then we can start with the first presentation.
