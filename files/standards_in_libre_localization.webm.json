{"text": " Hello, everyone. So we have here Benjamin Jamie who will be sharing should there be a standard and Libra localization. Ideas on how to make it easy for translators to contribute to any FOSS project they like. Thank you, Benjamin. Thank you for the applause. I didn't deserve that yet, definitely. Thank you for being in such a large count here. So I'm Benjamin. I work in WebLate. I do the talking there and you can also meet Michael in this lovely hoodie here and he's the mind behind the code and everything and the founder. I won't be talking much about WebLate here. That's the talk tomorrow in translation's dev room. Here I would like to share a story and kick off something probably that could become a standard in Libra localization because at the moment it's nothing like that there. At first I would like to talk a short start of WebLate story. It doesn't start like a masterminded start-up plan that will get a lot of money and conquer the world of the localization. No, that's other companies. We are Libra software from the start and Michael actually started it when he was working at SUSE and now SUSE people are very proud that they started it during the SUSE hack week 12 years ago. Sorry, 11 years ago. And for a long time this is the office. It was actually the office at the top of the building of those large concrete buildings you have around the Czech Republic built in socialism and when you needed an elevator there, there was those like small on top of the building blocks where you put all the machinery for your elevator but it's not needed now so all the machinery is downstairs in the shaft and Michael had his office on the top of the building and it's like three to four meters or something like that and that's how he started it and it was not aimed to do something that will be masterminded and well prepared for all the use cases. It was just in the start the use case that Michael wanted something better than PUTL which was a very popular tool but no longer maintained and something that's very tightly integrated with this version control system so you don't have to do much of the manual work and you are a developer so you connect Weblight to your version control system and it just works. You don't have to care about anything and then everything is in the editor and you know localization editors from Weblight and from other similar tools and then more and more big open source projects and some commercial companies went to ask Michael, hey, we would like to use it. Can we pay you for supporting it and yeah that's how Weblight started getting bigger and these days there are large or small Libre projects that are using Weblight and oh sorry I forgot to put a pen pod logo there. We'll do tomorrow but there is Calidas and more and more Libre projects started using it and it became some sort of a go for tool and then Fedora came I think three years back to us and migrated all their stuff from Xanata from their original platform they created to Weblight because Xanata was like we don't have time for that, that's not our core of business so we won't use Weblight and that's how we realized that this is maybe the thing that will be happening more and it became our responsibility. We took very seriously to give the tool to the communities that they can use happily and they can contribute to but it's still just one platform. It's Weblight and we created last year a page called Discover Weblight so if you are on a hosted Weblight, if you have your projects on a hosted Weblight which is the largest instance of Weblight on the internet it's easy to search there and it will be even easier throughout this year because of the development and if you host yourself your instance we wanted to give the users a place where they can come and search through all the Weblight instances that are open to contribute to this page so at this point if the project is using Weblight you have this place and you can search for your project name let's say Benpot and you will be guided to the right place and you can contribute to the localizations there but what about if the project because there are so many projects in Libra world that are not using Weblight yet or they want to stick with different tool because it's always your choice what do you use in your community. Sorry. So there became an idea and I think two years back and that's really important to say the time frame I was speaking with Dwayne. Dwayne is a wonderful person author of Translate Toolkit which is one of the core component for that Weblight uses to work with translation files and Dwayne is very talkative like I am so we were talking a lot and then I told him yeah and maybe there should be a way for someone that wants to contribute to Libra software like one place possibly federated because so it's not in one central place where I as a translator of Libra software that's not technically savvy and I want to contribute the time to the project of my choice but I don't want to search through readme's and wiki's because every project has its own different way or there is no information and you have to really dig hard to find it or if you are at Fosdem you can walk around the booths and see a little bit like a little advertisement or small stand that says this project is localized on Weblight but if you are in the online world you are you will spend usually a lot of time to find where is the right place to localize your favorite software and I told that to Dwayne and Dwayne said oh yeah I had that idea a while before and I have it very roughly specified and we were talking more and then he sent like nine pages long nice specification of how it could look like and how it could work and there are so many other features that we would like to have there but that was two years ago and nothing happened because there is no time to do that in Weblight team and it should be a community thing it shouldn't be something that Weblight says this is the thing how you should do it and everybody should use it it can be like that but we are at Fosdem there are so many wonderfully skilled people that may be interested in not only helping with the actual development but also sharing their ideas and maybe they because it's such obvious thing that's missing maybe there are so many people that already have similar ideas or some kind of specification and I would like to use this talk if you have an idea I just want to kick it off we are not working on it yet we just want to connect we want to discuss and maybe in a year on next Fosdem we will have something like that and a lot of projects could use that or every project on Fosdem and it shouldn't be just about Weblight it should be maybe a file like you have a license file in your repository or a readme file that can be indexed by some tool so if I want to have an instance a server where I could guide let's say I'm a localization lab or some other lovely group of people that wants to localize open source software they can use some kind of tool put it on their website on their own server and tell if you have your time select language you want to contribute to and find your project and this might should index those readme's or translation md files from not only github and gitlab but probably more and more can it be done probably yes it has it will have some limits it probably won't scan all the repositories in the world that's not possible but maybe we can make something bigger than discover Weblight that's universal use for everyone now what should they do is to guide the translator to the right platform to the right place because if I'm a translator I don't and I don't know all the technical way of the localization which can be make easier by localization management software like Weblight I just want to translate my hello to hello and that's it and it should be unified so everybody can use it it should be possible to index it somehow to search through it and yeah that's that's a start and probably there is much more that it should do it but in a started this would be nice and yeah let's discuss if you go not right now because I have to add a link once I finish the talk but this is the place where you can go and search through Weblight schedule I just double check yeah it's right there is no miss click so if you go there you can see all the schedule all the plans we as Weblight have for this for them I will add there a link to the discussion and you can join you can share it with your friends that are interested in such things and maybe we will come up with something interesting for every possible translator in the Libre community or in ideal way this tool or this localization file or translation and whatever we will call it can do can welcome you translators that don't feel I'm a translator and then don't know how to get there maybe to make it easy for everyone so that's it that's what I wanted to share with you and yeah I'm interested in what do you think maybe we still have three minutes so we can talk something right now you can also if you go to that link you can also find our bio stickers t-shirts and yeah other things and you can share your ideas there about Weblight and what we should include and if you don't like something just come there and tell us or you can join the online discussion that will be ready in a few minutes and yeah thank you for your attention and if anybody has a question or anything just raise your hand or come here and tell it to us thank you for your time and injera for them", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.72, "text": " Hello, everyone.
