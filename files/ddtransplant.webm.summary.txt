In this talk, Stefan Krakowski discusses how to port Linux kernel drivers into the Genode OS framework more quickly and accurately. He explains the motivation behind using Linux drivers in a microkernel environment, which includes the complexity of modern hardware and limited time for development. He presents two approaches to driver porting: using pure driver code or reusing as much as possible from the original codebase. He then outlines the steps involved in the porting process, such as configuring a minimal executable Linux kernel, identifying device drivers and dependencies, compiling the drivers, and resolving undefined symbols. Stefan also discusses the results of their porting efforts and highlights the benefits of their approach, including reduced manual work and a better alignment between drivers and different contexts. He concludes by sharing resources for further reading on the topic and opens the floor to questions.
