The talk was given by Todd Gamblin at the FOSDEM conference in 2023. Todd discussed the Continuous Integration (CI) system implemented in SPAC, a free and open-source package manager. He explained how SPAC allows users to install different versions of software and customize their environment. He also mentioned the challenges of CI for HPC and the difficulties of building a reliable service for the large number of packages in SPAC. Todd outlined the architecture of the CI system, including the use of AWS resources and GitLab. He highlighted the importance of maintaining the trustworthiness of the binaries generated by SPAC and the need for continuous testing and integration on the develop branch. Todd also discussed the trade-offs and challenges in managing and testing pull requests and the potential use of merge queues to streamline the process. In addition, he mentioned the possibility of generating a software bill of materials (SBOM) for auditing purposes.
