The speaker, Thorsten, talks about the update in LibreOffice accessibility with a focus on PDF accessibility. Accessibility can mean many things, but it is mostly about making products, devices, and services usable by people with disabilities. The talk highlights the difference between document and application accessibility and the ongoing work towards improving both. The speaker discusses the PDF Universal Accessibility Standard, the Matterhorn protocol, and the validators used to check document accessibility. The team worked on fixing bugs and adding features such as a decorator flag for files, UX improvements, and an automatic online accessibility checker. The future plans involve improving user experience and making LibreOffice more user-friendly.
