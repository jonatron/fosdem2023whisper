{"text": " So, we are ready for the second talk and yeah, I'm happy to have Joy here from SPP talking about very condition monitoring and how to do that with open source software. Hello everybody, happy to see that it's this crowded, I wasn't expecting that but I'm pleasantly surprised. So, I'm going to talk to you today from a very niche department of SBB which is measurement and diagnostics. We're basically part of the infrastructure like Eloy before, we're trying to maintain and run the infrastructure in Switzerland. It's not such a big country but a very dense train network, so the problems we face is basically that we have shallow train passing times and a lot of maintenance to do and to be able to do this maintenance at the right moment. We have the measurement and diagnostics department which I am part of and we basically have two major goals. One is to maintain the safety of the system and the other one is to put out a gather data of the infrastructure assets in order to be able to do predictive maintenance or maintenance at the right moment and just to make sure that the money spent is well spent in order that the assets can live the most long without breaking down. Here you can see two of our measurement trains, they're typically sensor based measurements, typically optically made measurements and we'll go a little bit deeper into that afterwards. Normally, I was planning to be here with one of my colleagues, Jean Ch\u00e9d\u00e9ric, unfortunately he got sick, he catch the cold so I'm here alone but I thought I will still have his picture on a slide in case somebody is interested in what we're doing later on, you will know him by face at least. He's the guy who's doing a lot of the technical implementation, solving a lot of the technical problems and I'm more on the strategic part of the project and we'll leave it by that. Such a measurement from sensor to information is quite a long way so it's a very complex thing, such a measurement system. I've drawn here a couple of steps from beginning to end for track geometry measurement so as I said before most of them are optical by now so what you actually do is you have a laser plane that shines on your track and then you have a camera that makes a photo and the first picture is basically a digital photo of the rail and then you extract this contrast change and you do a lot of software and you get the second photo which is a half profile of your rail. Then you do the same thing for the second half of your rail and you get a full profile and you start measuring on it and you do for instance, it may be a bit difficult to see but there's a lot of little crosses on the profile and those are the points that you're interested in, the top of your rail or there's 1.14 mm below the top of your rail and from this, if you have both rails, you can deduce your track geometry, in instance the gauge and the, louder, okay, I will talk louder. You will have the possibility to deduce the gauge or the elevation or the longitudinal levels of your tracks and you can then print them in form of the fourth picture like as 1D plots and afterwards you've gathered this information, you have to deduce what to do with it. So in SBB and I think in a lot of other countries in Europe now too, you try to do analysis over time to see how the track geometry or other parameters in your railway system change over time and find critical passes to where you know in some time in the future that asset will break and then you can do maintenance in the right moment and assure that it won't break or that it stays safe a little bit longer or you can deduce, oh, I'm too late, I have to change that and RCM, our software suit that we built ourselves is basically an acronym for rail condition monitoring saying this whole first part of the value chain here up to the fourth picture and we try to automate that and to make it a bit more generic and we're currently trying to do that with the now shown architecture so we have the measurement platform on the left side, it gets from the administrative tools for instance topology like to know what kind of tracks exist in Switzerland. We've talked yesterday with Infrabel, it's quite similar and I've also talked to people from SNCF, I've also talked to people from Network Rail at the end, you need a topology to put your measurement data to an asset to a certain location in the physical world and while before I was not sure, before we started with this project, I was not sure if this will be a big problem if the topologies will be vastly different from country to country but at the end since the requirements are very similar from country to country, I came to observe that the solutions that came up are also very similar and I do believe that it's possible to have a generic topology description between countries and this will be, we'll see later on, a bit crucial for this project to work in different countries. Once we get the measurement on the measurement platform, we have this automated data cleansing and quality control processing platform and basically the first thing is the positioning as I said before that would be to tie the measurement to a physical location on your topology and the second thing that we do is a conversion, so whatever comes into one of those measurement, whatever comes from one of those measurement platforms, one of those measurement trains, we convert it into our open data format and this is the first thing I would like to talk to you about, how do you, how do you say that, we'll talk about a bit more detail afterwards. Once we have it in an open format, we do a standardization like the different measurement systems provide the same measurement in different flavors, let's say the gauge once come in an absolute number, 1.35 meters, the second system shows it as a deviation from zero, one shows it in meters, one shows it in millimeters, you have to standardize that a little bit in order to be able to compare it afterwards. We do a consistency check and then we do a persistence and once we persist that data, we have at least in Switzerland regulations to follow, especially on the duration and on the capacity to be able to read the data again in the future. In Switzerland this is about 15 years, so if we do a measurement we have to be, to guarantee that for the next 15 years we are able not only to show the measurement but also to open it and to read the data and this again something that is much easier to do if you have an open data format which is not proprietary, which is not tied to a specific software or a specific software version that you have to maintain too. Then it goes to the presentation layer and the presentation layer typically can be various different programs. In our case in Switzerland we use IRISIS from Ertman in Germany, I think there's a couple of other countries in Europe that do that too, but we also use our own viewing software which we call RCM Viewer, which will be the second part of the open source project I would like to talk about and which can show obviously the open data format that we use. Once this data is gathered, typically now if you buy a system on the market there are different enterprises that sell such systems, for instance MIRMC in southern Italy or Placer Anteuter from Austria, which are two of the biggest players also, there's ENSCO in the United States, you get a proprietary format from them. You may or may not be able to read it depending on how your contract is, so I know SNCF had had in the past some problems with that that the contract did not state that you are allowed to actually know the data format, your data comes to you and once you figured that out and that you are able to read it, you will free yourself from the use of the software that they impose on you if they sell you the measurement system, and we've done that in Switzerland over the last years, we've had the same issues, don't worry, and are now at a point where all our measurement systems are either directly delivering an open data format or at least that we have full specification of the data format that is delivered to us in binary, and we're now trying to transpose that into our open format. For that, with the last measurement train that we acquired, we specified such a format based on an open standard which is HDF5, hierarchical data format 5, you can find it online, it exists since, I think, 20 years, it's widely used in the academic world, it's also the base of matlaps.m files, for instance, and it has the advantage that most programming languages and most measurement data programs like R or DADM or others that are out there already have stops or libraries to read it. So with data themselves, HDF5 themselves says their key features and advantages are metadata with data, fast IO, big data, and the other stuff that you can read here, and what we try to do is to write a specification upon the HDF5 that is specific for railway data, that generic enough that it can handle all type of measurement systems. Basically, you have the advantages of HDF5, and on the same time, the possibility if you follow this specification that we wrote that then you can find on GitHub that a software like the one that we built can read it whatever your measurement systems are, if you buy it from Merrimick, if you buy it from Placer Interior, if it's track geometry, or if it's, I don't know, from Sperry ultrasonic measurements or whatever else is out there, as long as you follow the specification, you can use the software to display it, you can use the software to overlay it, and so on. We named it RCMDX, Rail Condition Monitoring Data Exchange, and our key features for it is that it includes the metadata like configuration, but also the topology, and it makes it completely self-contained. So in 15 years, you take one file, you do not need anything else than the file itself and the specification of the data to be able to reproduce a view of the data. So on the track, in the system as it was in the moment that the data was gathered, and I think this helps a lot. And as I said before, it's accessible through the standard HDF5 tools, so you can download an HDF5 library from their website and directly access the data. You can also build your own using the programming language, Python has a stop, and Java, and C++ and Csharp also. And on the other side, you still have the genericity in order to use whatever measurement system you want. And let's see, like one of the benefits that you would get if you decide to use such a thing. For us, one of the main benefits is that you could, if it gets adopted by more than one country, let's say, you get the advantage that in an open tender where you have to specify what you want to buy, you can handle the whole data part with just one single phrase. Please deliver the data in this specification, you can find it on GitHub. As soon as more than one tender writes it inside, I think it's basically close to a standard because this market is very small. The companies that I told you before are basically covering over 80% of the whole market. So as soon as they start to see that it is necessary to deliver their data in this format, you can get it for free. I think it's quite a big advantage that could be resulting out of using that. And of course, then as a result, you have a complete open data. We will see now, I'm switching from the data format to the viewing software. And this also is available already as freeware and will be in future as open source. And once you have your data in the RCMDX format, as soon as you follow the specification, you can basically use the software to display it. It's highly generic in the case that everything that you see now here is a workspace that can be easily configured by the user. So you can drag and drop every little window inside that workspace, put it somewhere else. You can configure it to show whatever data you want. You can change the parameters that are shown. You can change the boundaries that are shown. You can change the limits that you want to display. And you can show in parallel and synchrony in time, in space, and also on your topology different measurement systems. So you can show data from the track geometry system together with video data, together with optical data, together with ultrasonic data, whatever you think might benefit you the most. You can easily do it very complicated, or you can try to build new views that are less generic for an end user, for instance, for a maintenance manager, if you have to do a specific job, like in our case, the lower right part, like this part with optical data, he has to find surface defects, so you can put on a specific mask on the viewing software in order to help him to do that more efficiently. And yeah, you've seen it play, it's like a video that I made before. This viewing software is currently done in C-Sharp, and we're trying to put it open source since, I don't know, a bit more than a year. And the main problems that we are facing is we have begun building it like seven years ago, together with a new measurement coach, and it has some proprietary libraries in it. The main ones are Sidechart and Telerik for C-Sharp, and we're now trying to find a way to use open source while having those libraries inside, because it's very difficult to throw them out, especially Sidechart, there's no good alternative for the moment in order to be a performance viewing software. That's basically where we are right now. You can already download it on GitHub, I will show you, here's the link, there's also an overview later on, and we also have a couple of measurement files from Switzerland that you can download too, a couple of workspaces, and like that you can see how the data format works, how the viewing software works, how they interact together, and in case of implement your own version of it. And of course, the benefit of the viewing software would then be that you are able to do massively complex views with Synchron, I don't know how you say that in English, display data at the same time, and at the same position, or at the same point in the physical world, so basically the viewing software allows you to include the topology also if it's not exactly the same, so we have in Switzerland twice a year an update on the topology, and obviously some things changed due to maintenance work, due to new building of the tracks and so on, and viewing software can handle that in order if you have different states and different files, because as I said before, every file includes your topology too, so then you can display the data where it is taken on tracks that did not have changes and it will show you where it had changes and do not display the data in the same way if the track changes were applied, and then you can in the viewing software change from one view, from one topology view to another one, and you have an easy and powerful presentation layer I think, if you do so, and of course, we talked yesterday about it, if you take a measurement run and you run from eight o'clock in the morning till noon and you do a hundred kilometers and you do a circle, then if you show it in time you will have a straight 1D chart of your measurement data, if you show it in a distance you will have the same thing, a straight chart with a distance based on an x-axis instead of time, and if you show it in topology then you have a much shorter bit showing an overlay of how many circles you have run through in that morning, so this is quite an interesting thing to do and it is basically what most easily accessible viewing software lacks, so this possibility to tie it to your physical location like that. Then we have the licensing, we worked a lot together with Cornelius, together with Mahalia and also with Christian, which is sitting back there on the licensing that we will be using and we decided to use an Eclipse public license after some discussions on what would make sense, mainly because it is a weak copy left license and I can imagine a future where a measurement system company uses this software directly, say your startup company, you built your own measurement system, you need a presentation layer, you can take the RCMDX data format and the viewing software and create your own possibly commercial version of it by adding your own flavor to it and still be able to sell it as long as the core functionality if you improve it, you send it back upstream and that would be like the ideal version that we could attend in the future and that is basically one of the reasons why I am here to hope that all of you will go home and use it and spread it and bring your own companies to use it too. Let's see an overview, so right now the most important link is the first one, SBB has since one week now a project website for this and if you click on it, maybe something happens, I don't know, right, you will directly get to a website where you can find the, it does not show, thank you, why is it so big, okay at least you can read it, so you can see the website and there is a couple of links somewhere, so you have sample data that you can download directly, I think it is more or less one kilometer of data but it gives a good impression how the whole system can work and if you are really interested in having more data you can still contact me or Jean-Frederick and we can give you access to it and there is this more on topic, normally if it wouldn't be so zoomed out it would be a bit nicer and on the top right of the site but you can directly download the installer for the viewing software and you can directly go to the Github page with the format description and yeah you also have the workspaces that you have to load into the viewing software, you can also create your own ones, that is just the help if you want to play around with it, that is basically most of what I wanted to say, thank you very much for listening and I think we have a couple of minutes for questions too. Excellent, see, thank you very much. Please, that is the need point, you don't need to have the corresponding software if you don't want to, as soon as your data is described properly it is self-contained so you can build at any moment a new software to access it, you can of course keep your software too but you don't need to, you have the specification, you can build a tool to read it within a couple of days, time's up, okay, thank you very much.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 24.16, "text": " So, we are ready for the second talk and yeah, I'm happy to have Joy here from SPP talking", "tokens": [407,
