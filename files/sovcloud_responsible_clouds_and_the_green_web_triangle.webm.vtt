00:00.000 --> 00:11.440
Who can hear me? If you can hear me at the back froming through the sound, can you, okay,

00:11.440 --> 00:17.600
it's, I think, it sounds like you can hear me at the back. Excellent, all right. Okay,

00:17.600 --> 00:21.840
well, it turns out I'm a little bit early, but I'm going to use those two minutes for

00:21.840 --> 00:27.440
questions at the end of the talk, if possible. All right, folks. Welcome to Responsible Clouds

00:27.440 --> 00:34.320
and the Green Web Triangle, how to make the climate case for a diverse cloud ecosystem.

00:34.320 --> 00:39.720
I work for the Green Web Foundation.org and the URL for that non-profit is written across

00:39.720 --> 00:47.000
the bottom of this screen, as you can see. In case you can't see me, that's my face.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.440
This is a bit of a hangover from when you're doing remote talks because, yeah, it's weird

00:50.440 --> 00:56.200
being in a room with other people again. I have a background working in wacky environmental

00:56.200 --> 01:01.160
climate, climate tech startups, like as you can see, Loco 2, which is a triple layer pun

01:01.160 --> 01:07.440
around locomotion, low carbon, and like going a local on a crazy holiday. I also worked at

01:07.440 --> 01:11.280
a company called Amy, which stands for Avoid Mass Extinction Engine. We burned through

01:11.280 --> 01:16.600
something in the region of 20 million US dollars of VC money trying to put a carbon footprint

01:16.600 --> 01:21.600
API on anything we could find. These days, I work at the Green Web Foundation, where

01:21.600 --> 01:25.920
we track the transition of the internet away from fossil fuels to something greener. I

01:25.920 --> 01:30.560
also work with the Green Software Foundation, which is a larger industry body, where I'm

01:30.560 --> 01:36.560
the policy chair there. I also run a podcast. I co-host a podcast called Environment Variables.

01:36.560 --> 01:43.720
Get it? Yeah, which is all about green software. I also am a contributing editor to a magazine

01:43.720 --> 01:47.200
called Branch Magazine, which is all about the stuff, this kind of intersection between

01:47.200 --> 01:52.000
climate and tech. This is what we're going to cover today. I'm going to frame a kind

01:52.000 --> 01:56.600
of problem that you might think about when it comes to sovereign tech, sovereign cloud

01:56.600 --> 02:00.920
and sustainability. I'm going to talk a little bit about the drivers for sustainability at

02:00.920 --> 02:05.640
kind of regulatory level that happen in Europe specifically. Then I'm going to kind of talk

02:05.640 --> 02:11.880
about the idea of competing on transparency as a basis for a more diverse cloud ecosystem.

02:11.880 --> 02:18.720
So off we go. Framing the cloud, framing the problem with the Green Web Triangle. Most

02:18.720 --> 02:23.960
of you know that we basically build services by compiling them these days, lots of different

02:23.960 --> 02:28.400
services. So it's a bit like a kind of graph where things people see at the top is actually

02:28.400 --> 02:33.680
comprised of all these things that we might build all the way through that. When you're

02:33.680 --> 02:39.880
trying to actually use a service, you kind of end up with this kind of problem. If you

02:39.880 --> 02:44.400
want to make a service available to other people, or if you want to use a service, there

02:44.400 --> 02:48.880
are kind of like three things you want in my opinion. You want something to be convenient,

02:48.880 --> 02:52.240
like ideally hosted by someone else a lot of the time or at least so you don't have

02:52.240 --> 02:56.080
to be doing all yourself if you're a kind of medium to small size company. You probably

02:56.080 --> 02:59.440
want it to be fossil free because there's a whole kind of climate emergency thing going

02:59.440 --> 03:04.560
on. And ideally you'd like it to be kind of diverse so you're not dependent on only one

03:04.560 --> 03:09.800
provider who can jack up their prices or do all kinds of things that bad things happen

03:09.800 --> 03:15.240
when you're only relying on one provider. And you basically have, I think there are

03:15.240 --> 03:19.120
different failure modes when you think about this triangle because of most of the time

03:19.120 --> 03:24.720
you can only pick two. So for example, let's say you wanted to go for convenient and diverse.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.880
This is like the common thing that a lot of us kind of default to. Like it's basically

03:28.880 --> 03:34.800
the default, it's fossil fuel powered and it's a bit like being in a spaceship that

03:34.800 --> 03:39.520
you know is on fire and then you go to work and you type in a keyboard and you know things

03:39.520 --> 03:43.680
were on fire. Then you go home and you realize things were on fire. Then you feel kind of

03:43.680 --> 03:47.800
a little bit anxious. Unlike people call that climate anxiety. Like that's one of the things

03:47.800 --> 03:51.840
that some of you might feel when you think about this. But on the kind of like global

03:51.840 --> 03:56.120
scale there's an issue there. So that's the thing that we probably are in right now that

03:56.120 --> 03:59.960
we don't want to do all the time. The other one is diverse and fossil free. Maybe you

03:59.960 --> 04:04.600
do care about this and you're going to look for say green providers. But you also care

04:04.600 --> 04:09.360
about having diverse ecosystems and building or everything yourself. This is cool. But

04:09.360 --> 04:13.600
it kind of has another failure mode in that you spend loads and loads of time on undifferentiated

04:13.600 --> 04:18.720
heavy lifting which isn't necessarily creating the kind of value that you're basically employed

04:18.720 --> 04:23.960
for a lot of the time. Or alternatively there is you can go for convenient and fossil free

04:23.960 --> 04:28.680
because lots and lots of large companies now like say Microsoft and Amazon and Google

04:28.680 --> 04:33.880
are telling a really really like loud story about how much they're really kind of like

04:33.880 --> 04:38.840
running on green energy and doing a load load for the climate. Now there are kind of all

04:38.840 --> 04:42.960
kinds of problems which I'm in the middle. I'm in a sovereign cloud dev room where I

04:42.960 --> 04:47.480
don't need to kind of talk too much about. But there is also issues because these folks

04:47.480 --> 04:52.640
tend to be the people who are often the market leaders in helping people get oil and gas out

04:52.640 --> 04:57.840
of the ground and burn it. So even if you're running on say green software like they may

04:57.840 --> 05:02.000
be doing things which you might not be aligned with as an organization or you might feel

05:02.000 --> 05:07.440
somewhat uncomfortable about. So these are the three ways. These are the triangle and

05:07.440 --> 05:11.400
these are the kind of common failure modes that I think that are useful to talk to other

05:11.400 --> 05:17.160
people about and how I explain the problem with basically sustainable digital diverse

05:17.160 --> 05:20.720
services to people who want to actually make a switch and start using something which is

05:20.720 --> 05:25.960
not necessarily a number of really large providers but don't understand why you can't

05:25.960 --> 05:31.240
just move to like next cloud for everything. So that's like the problem that's the triangle.

05:31.240 --> 05:36.240
Now let's talk about the drivers for sustainability in tech at a regulatory level that might kind

05:36.240 --> 05:42.960
of help for some of this. So this graph is from Dr. Robert Rode from Berkeley Earth which

05:42.960 --> 05:47.840
is an environmental data science nonprofit and they're using data from the global carbon

05:47.840 --> 05:52.720
project and what you can see is historically like we've been growing in emissions however

05:52.720 --> 05:58.560
long and you can see this trajectory which people might refer to as business as usual.

05:58.560 --> 06:04.920
There's lots of different scenarios and it's actually titled SSP2. There's a lot of these.

06:04.920 --> 06:10.000
Can you see the kind of changes we would need to actually make to get down to like 1.5 degrees

06:10.000 --> 06:14.960
of global warming which is considered like the least worst option that you will typically

06:14.960 --> 06:22.560
see a lot of the time and this is you might have heard like 1.5 versus or 2 degrees for

06:22.560 --> 06:27.720
example like in 2015 pretty much every country on earth agreed that we should probably do

06:27.720 --> 06:32.640
something about climate and we should go for not more than 2 degrees of warming and then

06:32.640 --> 06:37.160
they actually you had a bunch of people say well actually 2 degrees is still pretty bad

06:37.160 --> 06:41.560
and then we did a bunch of research and found out that yes 1.5 is what we should be thinking

06:41.560 --> 06:48.360
about naturally and despite that we've actually had people thinking okay well what does that

06:48.360 --> 06:56.640
mean for us as a sector as a technology sector and in 2020 you had a bunch of digital and

06:56.640 --> 07:00.760
sustainability focused organizations trying to figure out what that would mean for us

07:00.760 --> 07:05.480
as a sector like how would how would we need to kind of drop our emissions for example

07:05.480 --> 07:09.080
and as you can see this quote that came out when it was issued in this from this press

07:09.080 --> 07:13.880
release basically said yeah to actually have the Paris Agreement which is less ambitious

07:13.880 --> 07:19.480
than that 1.5 thing they basically said you need to halve emissions by 20 you need to

07:19.480 --> 07:24.800
reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 in seven years time so that's basically making reduction

07:24.800 --> 07:31.640
of around 7% each year year on year and well we haven't really been reducing things by

07:31.640 --> 07:36.720
7% each year so it's actually going to be larger so this is basically what the science

07:36.720 --> 07:42.000
is spelling out for us the thing that's quite interesting this year is that you've had people

07:42.000 --> 07:45.760
talking about net zero for a while but now people are starting to actually say well what

07:45.760 --> 07:50.480
does net zero really mean in the context of this science actually and has anyone heard

07:50.480 --> 07:55.480
of the ISO here ISO with standards folks okay they come up with something really interesting

07:55.480 --> 07:59.880
that they published in November they basically said if you want to call something net zero

07:59.880 --> 08:03.800
you actually need to have some teeth behind it and needs to actually mean something now

08:03.800 --> 08:07.760
so while there's been lots and lots of kind of greenwashing net zero targets and things

08:07.760 --> 08:11.840
from those organizations they've basically come out and said actually this is the kind

08:11.840 --> 08:16.520
of stuff you need for net zero now and they've basically said if you have net zero claims

08:16.520 --> 08:22.680
by 2050 without having about anything related to harbing missions by 2030 they're not credible

08:22.680 --> 08:26.400
and if you don't include your supply chain to just only think about your own things rather

08:26.400 --> 08:30.880
than like who made a computer or anything like that not credible and also if you don't

08:30.880 --> 08:35.880
have any interim targets in the next few years also not credible because this is quite important

08:35.880 --> 08:41.320
because seven years is about the same time as the average tenure for a CEO which basically

08:41.320 --> 08:45.320
means you can say oh we're going to be net zero leave then it's someone else's problem

08:45.320 --> 08:48.680
to solve and this is them basically saying actually you need to have something now so

08:48.680 --> 08:53.920
you can't do that kind of stuff. What's also interesting in Europe specifically is the

08:53.920 --> 08:59.800
catchly titled European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Basically if you were

08:59.800 --> 09:05.440
in a company which has more than 250 employees you need to be recording and reporting some

09:05.440 --> 09:10.000
information about what your carbon emissions look like and you need to start reporting

09:10.000 --> 09:16.800
in 2024 which means you need to be reporting two months ago to start doing this. So that

09:16.800 --> 09:22.160
is interesting because lots of lots of organizations don't even have a sustainability team and

09:22.160 --> 09:27.520
don't even know how to start reporting this stuff and then finally the IFRS sorry about

09:27.520 --> 09:33.320
all the acronyms these folks are you can think of them as like the pope of accounting right

09:33.320 --> 09:37.680
they're the people who just basically set a decree which everyone then follows in accounting

09:37.680 --> 09:42.240
land. They've basically said that supply chain thing that people talk about yeah actually

09:42.240 --> 09:46.960
we should be doing that and you can't just say about your own organization rather than

09:46.960 --> 09:51.880
all the things you buy from other people for example. So that's what people have been saying

09:51.880 --> 09:56.120
and how are we doing so far like as a tech sector right. So there's good news and there's

09:56.120 --> 10:02.200
bad news all right the good news is is that well we have seen lots and lots of use and

10:02.200 --> 10:06.400
like more people are connected to the internet which I think is in broadly speaking a good

10:06.400 --> 10:10.120
thing and I don't know about you folks but I quite liked having access to the internet

10:10.120 --> 10:13.840
during the pandemic. I think that's been more useful and it'll be a lot more kind of lonely

10:13.840 --> 10:20.320
and sad and cold and everything if I wasn't connected to that and you generally see that

10:20.320 --> 10:23.960
we've basically been using much much more in the way of digital services over the last

10:23.960 --> 10:30.040
say 10 years or so but the growth hasn't been that large really it hasn't been proportional

10:30.040 --> 10:35.520
and there's a number of reasons for this. Let's okay we can just can we just not talk

10:35.520 --> 10:41.520
about cryptocurrency I'm sorry like it's not helping billions of people right the two billion

10:41.520 --> 10:45.560
people who joined the internet pretty sure didn't help two billion people yes using like

10:45.560 --> 10:50.560
about half the impact half the energy of all the data centers on earth all right. So that's

10:50.560 --> 10:54.280
the thing so we're basically going in the direction which is not ideal at the moment

10:54.280 --> 10:59.920
and we need to kind of be reducing this and I guess there are now some companies which

10:59.920 --> 11:02.760
are trying to step up on this and they're trying to basically say well we want to keep

11:02.760 --> 11:07.480
growing which has issues of its own but maybe one thing we can do is actually make the energy

11:07.480 --> 11:13.200
we use greener. So you now see very very large companies like say Google say well 2030 is

11:13.200 --> 11:17.880
an important date we're going to make sure that all of our energy is running on or the

11:17.880 --> 11:24.840
energy we use is coming from green sources 24-7 and 24-7 is important because okay you

11:24.840 --> 11:28.920
know how like you bill for cloud like an hourly basis and there's about maybe 9000 hours

11:28.920 --> 11:33.000
in a year yeah all right. Normally when you look at green energy and people say I'm running

11:33.000 --> 11:38.800
on green energy it's like an average basically saying for all the power I've used if I've

11:38.800 --> 11:46.560
used maybe actually the way I describe it to people is like this we all know that we

11:46.560 --> 11:51.320
should probably get about eight hours of sleep right yeah like a or around that in a 24 hour

11:51.320 --> 11:57.080
period and if I wanted when you normally have green energy right now you can basically say

11:57.080 --> 12:02.440
well I've it's a bit like me saying I'm no only to get eight hours of sleep every night

12:02.440 --> 12:07.480
and I've got a year so what I'm going to do is I'm going to have 3000 hours of sleep at

12:07.480 --> 12:11.840
the beginning of the year all right and then I'm just going to run on red bull and chocolate

12:11.840 --> 12:15.800
bars for the rest of the year and that's going to be sustainable that's kind of like annual

12:15.800 --> 12:19.440
energy balancing that's kind of what the accounting is going to be like and there's more to it

12:19.440 --> 12:23.080
than that but like that's what we currently have at the moment which is why 24-7 is actually

12:23.080 --> 12:27.920
allowable and quite an important goal Microsoft is also doing this they've said well they're

12:27.920 --> 12:33.800
going to run a hundred percent a hundred percent zero coming with zero carbon purchases which

12:33.800 --> 12:38.640
again sounds kind of cool and like these are companies with almost infinite money I say

12:38.640 --> 12:43.960
almost because they use as a basis for firing lots lots of people despite being really really

12:43.960 --> 12:50.640
profitable still but there it turns out that actually you don't need to be a ginormous

12:50.640 --> 12:53.720
company with infinite money to actually kind of set this kind of target and actually be

12:53.720 --> 12:59.320
moving this quickly this is peninsula clean energy they're based in California they're

12:59.320 --> 13:03.720
a small community choice aggregator which is basically a bit like a non-profit energy

13:03.720 --> 13:08.280
company and they've said well actually we think we think we can do it by 2025 because

13:08.280 --> 13:15.680
we built the idea of avoiding an absolute climate kind of crisis into our governance

13:15.680 --> 13:20.120
board basically and we if it makes us slightly less profitable that's okay because we're

13:20.120 --> 13:23.440
not answering to shareholders so they show that they can do that and they've also actually

13:23.440 --> 13:27.680
shared all the actual underlying model in python to show how they actually bought all

13:27.680 --> 13:33.400
their stuff as well so you can actually do this and there's something interesting in

13:33.400 --> 13:37.240
Europe that's happened this in the last week actually do you know how like Elon Musk did

13:37.240 --> 13:40.920
that whole thing where he just cut off API access to Twitter and then everyone's like

13:40.920 --> 13:44.760
oh now this thing I was going to do one like that's a massive enough start using now because

13:44.760 --> 13:48.400
I should be using and I meant to do it anyway right there's this kind of my idea that you

13:48.400 --> 13:53.120
would get around to it kind of the same thing happened with fossil fuels in Europe right

13:53.120 --> 13:57.280
so we basically had this idea where Europe has been using loads of fossil fuels from

13:57.280 --> 14:02.720
Russia and then Russia basically switched off the pipe and now you basically see press

14:02.720 --> 14:06.680
releases like this saying well we've got off Russia we've got off Russian gas folks and

14:06.680 --> 14:09.920
now we've got all this money we can spend on that we would have otherwise spent on on

14:09.920 --> 14:15.040
fossil fuels so it's a bit like lemon and making lemonade but basically the upshot is

14:15.040 --> 14:19.280
that you basically you basically got the European Commission president and the people who essentially

14:19.280 --> 14:23.920
run Europe saying well we've got a quarter of a trillion euros that we would have spent on gas

14:23.920 --> 14:28.160
and now we're planning to spend it on kind of more cool things like net zero technology and like

14:28.160 --> 14:34.480
wind and solar and stuff which I think is actually well I'll take it I suppose all right so that's

14:34.480 --> 14:37.920
kind of what's happening at kind of regulatory level but I think it's quite interesting and

14:37.920 --> 14:43.840
anyway let's talk about competing on transparency for a diverse cloud ecosystem because the thing

14:43.840 --> 14:48.320
is we basically have the science telling us we need to reduce emissions and there are ways

14:48.320 --> 14:51.760
of there are some organizations which start saying yeah we're making all this we're doing

14:51.760 --> 14:55.760
all this kind of big splashy stuff and it's turning up there's more in the way of resources to do

14:55.760 --> 15:02.080
this stuff and there is this kind of narrative in policy circles right now where all the innovation

15:02.080 --> 15:07.280
has to come from very very large companies and I think it's not really true particularly in like

15:07.280 --> 15:11.680
well basic cloud for example there's low all kinds of cool stuff that you see from small providers

15:11.680 --> 15:17.360
in Europe for example so OVH cloud pioneers in say liquid cooling and servers as you can see here

15:17.360 --> 15:22.240
and then we're doing it for ages scale way for like a french cloud provider using arm service

15:22.240 --> 15:25.840
for ages as well like this is the thing that people make a big thing of but it's been like just

15:25.840 --> 15:31.040
standard as well as okay adiabatic cooling is basically using some ideas first developed in

15:31.040 --> 15:35.920
Iran to basically reduce the use of water but still make things cool they basically use it inside

15:35.920 --> 15:40.160
their servers rather than drawing loads and loads of water out of like the local kind of aquifers

15:40.160 --> 15:44.960
this is important because in some parts of the world in there are google data centers which use

15:44.960 --> 15:50.080
the same amount of water as the city they're in basically so like you should be caring about this

15:50.080 --> 15:53.440
kind of stuff and anyway there's loads of other examples that I've listed here I'm sure you can

15:53.440 --> 15:59.280
read them as well and there's also an interest at a kind of regulatory or kind of public sector

15:59.280 --> 16:03.600
level now where people are trying to actually figure out what sustainable software really looks

16:03.600 --> 16:09.520
like and how do you standardize it and how do you procure for this so ocular which was released by

16:09.520 --> 16:15.360
which was kind of celebrated by kde recently they have the first kind of blau angle blue angel kind

16:15.360 --> 16:21.200
of sustainable software kind of certificate which was issued to ocular pdf reader around

16:21.200 --> 16:25.600
september last year and this is interesting because this is the kind of stuff that people

16:25.600 --> 16:30.240
who spend money on trying to actually procure green and actually buy green and digital services

16:30.240 --> 16:36.240
are actually getting now and if you work in a company and you're using some of the large providers

16:36.240 --> 16:40.960
this is important because it turns out to be quite difficult to get the metrics from the very

16:40.960 --> 16:46.320
very big hyperscalers this is a this is actually a table from a person called mark butcher at

16:46.320 --> 16:50.240
positive cloud he shared some of this with me because he was trying to figure out well okay if

16:50.240 --> 16:54.960
you're using these big providers what information can you get from them who wait when they're in

16:54.960 --> 17:00.000
your supply chain that you need to report against and well basically I won't go into all the details

17:00.000 --> 17:04.960
here but the red stuff is bad right so if you're using the stuff on like those two providers

17:04.960 --> 17:10.160
not really a good one even on the left hand side you do see some information so microsoft is probably

17:10.160 --> 17:15.200
one of the better ones right now but they're still there's still some questions about what they report

17:15.200 --> 17:22.480
amazon the the level of reporting they give you is so so so low resolution that you can't tell if

17:22.480 --> 17:26.560
the emissions are coming from like one data center or another data center which is on the other side

17:26.560 --> 17:31.680
of a country thousands of miles away so you have some issues here because you might have one data

17:31.680 --> 17:35.680
center running essentially on coal and you have another data center running on hydropower which

17:35.680 --> 17:39.760
is definitely cleaner than coal all right and you have all this stuff here and this is one thing

17:39.760 --> 17:43.360
that you don't really have access to that if you're going to try and if you need to report you're

17:43.360 --> 17:47.680
going to have to be able to figure out how to actually get these numbers so you can see if you're

17:47.680 --> 17:52.320
making if we're going up or if you're going down like we saw before there's also loads of really

17:52.320 --> 17:57.280
cool open source tooling which makes it possible to get these numbers out so the most well-known one

17:57.280 --> 18:03.520
is cloud carbon footprint this is maintained by ThoughtWorks it plugs into billing APIs from say

18:03.520 --> 18:08.480
amazon from microsoft and google then they do some guesstimates based on available data to tell you

18:08.480 --> 18:13.920
what your figures might be because the various cloud providers have their own native ones which

18:13.920 --> 18:18.640
have very different assumptions to the open ones that you can challenge and you can ask questions

18:18.640 --> 18:24.080
about green coding metrics they did a talk today they basically put if you have a digital service

18:24.080 --> 18:29.200
they'll put every single service in a kind of docker container then track the energy used and

18:29.200 --> 18:33.360
i've got a really nerdy kind of part of a talk that five o'clock later today where i talk about

18:33.360 --> 18:39.600
some of that scaffold i'm not going to pronounce that properly it's a french word for diving helmet

18:39.600 --> 18:45.360
and or diving suit it basically gives you process level energy usage metrics from any machine you

18:45.360 --> 18:49.520
run it on if you have access to the to the bare metal and it spits it out that you can kind of

18:49.520 --> 18:54.400
put into like dashboards and grafana kepler does more or less the same thing but for kubernetes

18:54.400 --> 18:59.680
using Berkeley you know extended Berkeley packet filters that's what they're called right yeah

18:59.680 --> 19:02.400
so that's another thing they do and there's another talk again about that kind of stuff

19:03.760 --> 19:07.280
so there is all this stuff which you can use and plug into your tooling where you can ask

19:07.280 --> 19:11.360
people to use so you can actually get the numbs to show that you're kind of putting us in the

19:11.360 --> 19:15.200
right direction if you're interested in and i think that's my time i'm just going to wrap up

19:15.200 --> 19:19.760
that was a green web triangle there are three things you can have convenient diverse fossil

19:19.760 --> 19:24.480
free most of the time you can only really pick two there's pressure right now to really push

19:24.480 --> 19:29.120
towards fossil free being a key thing which then really makes you decide am i going to be diverse

19:29.120 --> 19:34.800
am i going to be fossil free i mean the other one convenient you can compete on transparency and i

19:34.800 --> 19:40.480
think this is some area that you could actually kind of really kind of lead on and i think this is

19:40.480 --> 19:46.080
actually a way that this is this is probably underexplored right now and finally diverse

19:46.080 --> 19:50.080
ecosystems are healthy ecosystems there's policy support and there's money and there's funding

19:50.080 --> 19:55.200
to make this stuff possible and i think you should do it and i think that there's actually like

19:55.200 --> 19:59.440
even a policy idea around this the kind of word you need to use is twin transitions that's the kind

19:59.440 --> 20:04.240
of pseudo password you need to use when you speak into a policy maker and i think that's it thanks

20:04.240 --> 20:09.040
folks for my time there's a talk about a fossil free internet this talk is online with links to

20:09.040 --> 20:14.960
everything i showed you i'm on mastodon.social and okay there's probably mr chris helms on twitter

20:14.960 --> 20:18.640
but i don't really use it very much but you're welcome to tweet there i suppose and yeah that's

20:18.640 --> 20:29.280
my email address thank you everyone thank you chris um open for questions yes

20:32.320 --> 20:35.840
i'm also in like the element did matrix thing oh so if you've got a question there i'll try and

20:35.840 --> 20:46.560
answer it as well well hello i suppose i waited for some serious questions but i have one maybe

20:46.560 --> 20:53.120
a weird one what do you think about low earth orbit data centers you've talked about data

20:53.120 --> 21:06.080
centers in space that beam things down exactly uh i think they're if there was a way that you could

21:06.080 --> 21:10.320
get them into space without the rockets and you kind of there are actually some ways some wacky

21:10.320 --> 21:16.080
ways to do that i think it'd be cool i think astronomers have really strong opinions about

21:16.080 --> 21:21.360
that and also the whole idea of like privatization of space makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable

21:21.360 --> 21:25.040
because we're not great at dealing with our waste right now and if you have like all the waste that

21:25.040 --> 21:31.600
stops other people trans then i feel like that's maybe not the ideal solution basically also a

21:31.600 --> 21:37.120
little bit worry about having the guy in charge of twitter in charge of the future of space maybe

21:37.120 --> 21:40.640
like let's look at like how it's how he's handling twitter and think we want to kind of

21:40.640 --> 21:45.360
see where that goes i'm not sure about that that's that's my answer i suppose but probably not related

21:45.360 --> 21:53.600
to climate anyone else

21:59.840 --> 22:06.960
hi i just wanted to ask what can you do as a small company 10 to 15 people you are developing

22:06.960 --> 22:15.360
software probably for bigger clients i think what you can do you can write into your contract

22:15.360 --> 22:18.960
actually there's a website called the chance relaying project which has all these clauses

22:18.960 --> 22:24.800
for working with larger companies you can also allocate some of your revenue 1.5 percent of my

22:24.800 --> 22:31.120
revenue for 1.5 percent of us being alive and then use that to allocate that to fund things

22:31.120 --> 22:35.680
either internally making your own sustain your own organization greener or by funding things like

22:35.680 --> 22:39.920
non-profits or groups who are actually pushing for quality change stuff like that i think those are

22:39.920 --> 22:44.160
the things you could do which are easy to like write into a contract which would actually show

22:44.160 --> 22:48.720
that you were demonstrating leadership compared to other people this is also what we do in terms of

22:48.720 --> 22:52.320
training and consulting i'm very happy to chat about that because oh yeah i probably should have

22:52.320 --> 22:56.000
told told you everyone that yeah like this is what we do as well but yeah i'm happy to chat about

22:56.000 --> 23:06.000
that in more in more detail or answer questions on the element and stuff from that okay

23:10.000 --> 23:17.760
thank you hi thank you um you showed a few list of tools that help you get um energy yeah this one

23:17.760 --> 23:27.040
yes um how how much are how precise are they and how much do they go around like how how many

23:27.040 --> 23:32.480
assumptions do they make to get the numbers and what would be needed to don't make assumptions at all

23:32.480 --> 23:37.600
okay someone mentioned ilia before didn't they so ilia was like one of the german cloud providers

23:37.600 --> 23:43.200
i was sorry not cloud provider um energy provider um what we need to do is we need to get carbon

23:43.200 --> 23:47.840
emission figures from the energy providers so like they can tell you how dirty or clean the energy

23:47.840 --> 23:52.800
is at any moment in time so you need that basically scafandra is very very very good because it gives

23:52.800 --> 23:58.320
you very very good numbers but you need hardware support to actually share the information about

23:58.320 --> 24:03.760
this so intel they have something called wrapper which is running average power limit which gives you

24:03.760 --> 24:09.040
idea of the energy used by the cpu but not necessarily the gpu or the disk so you need all

24:09.040 --> 24:15.200
this stuff kind of instrumented for you to get this um kepler uh because you're going into the

24:15.200 --> 24:19.920
kernel you can get really really really detailed information but i'm kind of out of my lay at

24:19.920 --> 24:24.880
my league here because i can write docs but i can't write rust which is why i contribute to docs to

24:24.880 --> 24:31.440
scafandra instead of rust to to just scafandra um greed coding metrics there's also a talk online

24:31.440 --> 24:36.160
where the guy taught where arna turrara he talks about this in really really good detail and he's

24:36.160 --> 24:40.320
actually very very knowledgeable and cloud carbon footprint everything is open source and it's all

24:40.320 --> 24:44.960
in type script where they are very explicit about the assumptions they make all along and they're

24:44.960 --> 24:50.640
also open to pull requests i've committed to code to that one and yeah i haven't committed code to

24:50.640 --> 24:54.880
the other two but um they're cool people and i i i really support the projects i hope that helps

24:54.880 --> 25:10.800
and i'm again happy to chat in more detail thank you cool folks thank you
