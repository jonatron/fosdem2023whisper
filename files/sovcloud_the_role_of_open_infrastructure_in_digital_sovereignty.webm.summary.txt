This talk at FOSDEM discussed digital sovereignty in the context of open infrastructure. It explained why open source solutions, such as Linux, OpenStack, and Kubernetes, are well suited to provide programmable infrastructure, enabling independence, transparency, and interoperability. It proposed the Sovereign Cloud Stack project, which will provide a standard stack that can be used by providers to create a federation of interoperable cloud providers to compete with the U.S-based hyperscalers.
