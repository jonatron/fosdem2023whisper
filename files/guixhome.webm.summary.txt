In this talk, David Wilson from the System Crappers YouTube channel introduces Geeks Home, a system configuration tool written in Guile Scheme. Geeks Home allows users to manage their user-level configuration, or ".files," in a highly repeatable and resilient way. Using Geeks Home, users can install and configure software, roll back to previous configurations, and easily customize their configuration files for each machine they use. The talk includes demonstrations of how to generate a home configuration, apply it to the home folder, and explore different services and configurations available with Geeks Home.
