The speaker, Stefan, presented his work on a project called Game of Trees at the FOSDEM conference. Game of Trees is a project that uses Git repositories and the Git network protocol, but is not trying to replicate Git specifically. Stefan discussed the different components of the project, including the client side, which is already feature complete, and the server side, which he is currently working on. He explained the Git protocol and the design patterns used to create the server software, including the use of multiple processes with different tasks and the use of pledge and unveil to restrict access to resources. Stefan also mentioned some improvements he would like to make to the project in the future, such as verifying client uploads, improving the config file parsing, and adding built-in checks for commits. He concluded by encouraging questions from the audience.
