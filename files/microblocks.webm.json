{"text": " Let's just fetch our microblocks here, this happened to me before, why did that go away? I need to, let me just quit microblocks a second, oh there it goes, no I don't want to quit, okay so the cable wasn't quite plugged in, for some reason I lost my displays do something, so I said basic sensors just like that heady language, actually let me just quit microblocks really quick, this cable is being a little flaky, no no no it's and also in the display, okay so this is what it looks like and you have outputs, you have inputs and then you can do all the pins, you have your control variables, operators, all sorts of stuff like that but it, I plugged in this board, it showed a green here, it's already connected so it already knows what this board is and when I click temperature it tells me it's 19 degrees C, if I want to see the display I simply turn on the display, oh let's see I need this quick camera, so for those of you at home there's my happy face and then I click temperature, there it is there, keep losing this connection, okay, all right, every time the HDMI pops in and out it's causing microblocks to be unhappy, sorry about that, what's that, okay all right let's just try this one more time, load microblocks and another particularly cool it's okay, well it's very flaky, oh I lost it, let me see what happened to my power, so HDMI is lost don't touch anything, yeah we might have a few screen issues here, let me just try really quickly if I can quit and open again, okay, quite briefly I wanted to show you that you can graph something like the light level and you can also see the data you know of an input value and it will, let's put zero at the bottom and I can watch this in real time and if I close my hand over it it gets reflections on stuff but so you can see you can plot data in real time x y and z it has an accelerometer, so that's very cool, all right now we're going to go back so that's liveness, there's no compile download it's just happening, next point is that you can do things in parallel, so I'm going to show you a quick how multitasking is handled through just opening the two button blink program right here and I open this and if I press button, let me get my camera okay if I press button A while I'm pressing it it's going to repeat and blink 100 milliseconds while I press B it does the same thing I can actually press A and B and you know I can try to get them in sync or I can try to get them on and off but it's it takes too long so just as Hetty has you know variables I can do something like a delay so I can try to play around with it in real time and I set the delay to like 500 whoops and then I drag this delay variable in so I can play around with a slower blink time and change it all I want while I'm experimenting and now if I set that delay variable you can also use say block so it's it's nice to just set a variable and say it now I know what it is and if I'm pressing the A now you see it's every 500 and I can now I can more like get them on off on off and if you were in an Arduino loop just one continue forever loop this would be a lot harder to have either you know these different sync multitasking done for you which is very very cool the next thing is that it's autonomous so if I am programming and I'm doing these blocks on my my IDE then what happens is there's actually an opcode it looks a bit like assembly language representation of those blocks that our that you can see and then in the actual board it's it's actually in bytecode so if I were to turn on advanced blocks I could show you the instructions and you can see that and then I could actually actually see the bytecode and the bytecode is then what is inside the virtual machine so that will have cool ramifications about sharing our our files when we get to that point okay so um so blocks equate equate to bytecode so it's autonomous in the sense that if I unplug it from my laptop and I plug it back in then what happened did I did I lose my connection okay just oh I know what happened for autonomy I made a mistake I actually need a when started block to set that delay because there was delay of zero right so I actually needed this to be set okay we have to show our errors and now down here so there we go and I love having a co-speaker okay and then another another very awesome aspect of it is its portability so micro blocks if you you look at how we build the virtual machine we have a platform IO script within any file that has I looked last night there were up to 43 different boards and there's a kind of about nine varieties that if you go into micro blocks itself and you want to update the firmware on a board it will show you um well this is plugged in now I'm just updating the firmware on it but uh let me just unplug this for a moment and if you want to update the firmware on a board there's like micro bits calliope city the esp32s there's some new electrophreak the raspberry pi pico's and the eight behind eight of fruit is a whole bunch of boards but there's also in the platform IO any file a whole bunch of Arduino boards and and other stuff that's there so it's it's portable and I want to do a quick display of that where I take this quick cam I'm gonna make it big and we apply power so I have a whole bunch of boards plugged into a usb strip let's hope we don't lose the HDMI and Bernat's gonna turn that on and now you can see I have the heartbeat program running on a whole bunch of different boards so I kind of cheated on a couple boards that are new and didn't have full support like this M bits board but and of course the circuit playground doesn't have the same thing but on some of these OLED displays you can actually use the micro bit type style of display box and it still works and then go around and push the a button on everything so the a buttons turn them all the smiles and whoops dang just just so now they're all happy face and of course if they have B buttons we can go back to our heart and this is the only one that has a side B button voila so as you know like getting used to a programming environment when you pick up a different board do you want to get a different programming environment every time no clearly so portability portability is really cool okay so did I lose it completely all right I'm about to hand this off so that's good all right it's here okay and then the last part to explain is shareability so uh yeah I could do the same program so shareability is there's a few ways to to deal with this let me go in the slide slide show mode because I'm basically wrapped up one is like you can go to the file open save menu with micro blocks um let me just show you in real time here here so you can just go in here and say file you know save file open and then there's uh then there's these other options like encoded in the url so you can say file copy project url to a clipboard and then you can open it you give that url out and we do this you know embed a you just put a hyperlink on some you know documentation and you can open that right in the chrome browser chrome or edge browser support the serial mode you can't unfortunately use firefox i used to work from a zillip okay and then encoded in the picture so our documentation we have pictures on the websites in the wiki in the learn section and the code is actually embedded in the picture so you drag the picture into your chrome browser and or into your ide standalone or chrome browser and it will actually load the code and then the last part is it's shareable by opening from the board and so um i'm going to have for not demonstrate that as we hand off to more cool demo for part two okay can you hear me yes of course again okay so uh yeah we were talking about portability and one of the aspects of portability is not just that the code is portable across boards but the board itself is an example of portability the board is actually uh it contains the program that you are seeing here right uh in any other microcontroller environment once the code is here the code is here and it's it's gone if you've lost your program if you've lost your source the source is gone right uh in micrologs we have a way oops not this mic yeah yeah this microlog sorry uh that's open from board now i mean the browser version we have versions we haven't mentioned that but we have versions for the browser and for mac windows linux and chromebook and raspberry pi etc so we have many platforms that we support this is the browser version and now it says plug in the board and connect and click the usb usb icon to connect so i'll just connect as it said now i select the usb port and now it's actually reading back the code and it's not like we embedded the blocks inside the board it's actually for the i know this is a slightly geekier audience than our usual so we actually have a decompiler that john built in that's inspired in this quick decompiler uh that john also worked on and what it does is it takes these bytecodes and it retranslates them into what we see here right and just to prove that it still works uh it it does and you know we like to joke that micrologs is so portable that we could even port it to a board that does not exist and that's actually a joke but it's true like we have a board that doesn't exist and can't run micrologs since micrologs is vm-based you could compile this vm for something that does not exist that is virtual and that's why we made boardy boardy is a result of the pandemic we were doing online classes and it was really hard to get hardware to kits uh so that was an idea like christine christiane bowie uh my boss and jens and jatka's boss at SAP she got this idea that we needed something virtual so that kids who don't have access to hardware could still at least try micrologs and that's why we made boardy and boardy as you can see can run the same code it's not a simulator that's very important it's not a simulator it's running it's running the exact same vm so it's a virtual board not a simulator it has its own capabilities it has a couple of buttons it has a speaker it has a touch screen it has a file system it can do htdp client operations so it's a different sort of board okay it's yeah right so it does the same things okay uh but you know this is nice but micro blocks was always about physical computing this is nice if you don't have a board that's a good way to get started but our aim was always to teach physical computing to do tangible things in the real world in the physical world so let me show you one thing that you would not be able to do with boardy and that's connecting external sensors to your board so just this funny sensor that I have in here that's an RFID sensor that's technical mama jumbo for the thing that's in your credit card that lets you pay contactlessly or on your subway card or your gym membership card or whatever and I happen to have some of these cards with me as you all do I'm sure so for example yeah and maybe I need yeah I need a cable oops it's physical so this board has a battery but it's dead that's the problems of the physical world as well so I'm connecting an external battery to it okay and now I'm just going to try this has a micro box program in it by the way that I can show later maybe well I'll show it later so okay so I made it so it recognizes this particular card and it plays a tone okay that's interesting let's try another card okay let's try this one okay okay okay cool I'm missing some no wait yes we'll talk later I'll need a special number that comes with it as well let's try with my bank ones and this one as well okay so we have a bunch of cards and we've seen that each of them can make a note let's try to maybe oh yeah where is it I know it's somewhere oh maybe yeah you know when you're having trouble paying that's why because it's okay okay I'll try to play a song where is it there's a second part Kathy can you hand me your keys okay so that was to show that programming is fun but programming the real world and touching actual things is a very engaging way to get kids and people that are not hardcore geeks interested in what we do with these programming computers that was all go to the oh yeah go to the micro blocks website if you want to learn more about it remember micro blocks dot fun small fast human friendly that's our website we have very nice if I may say so learn page with a lot of tutorials micro box is also translated to a lot of language I forgot how many the code is also translated just like heavy and more translators just like heavy yeah and if you want to help out in our site there is a whole section about how to contribute and we have a space for everyone who wants to help out thank you do you have time for questions just maybe one or two right any questions is it expensive I was getting asked that a lot at the booth yesterday can I just because we were doing some demos in the sfc booth and the range if I can pull this how much was this maybe 25 dollars m5 stack probably even less than 10 for the m5 atom the micro bits were retail at 15 until the pandemic supply chain shortage is now there 20 or more the m bits what was this one now 12 dollars 25 the pico edge is maybe 10 this is maybe 25 so I would say they range you know less than 50 dollars and then you can buy some of these educational boards just show you like some of the small boards with stuff already included with stuff already included so you don't have to learn but the new robot aston.com pico ed board this is like 50 dollars but it has all these sensors and actuators and then you can pull apart the bricks as they're called and and use cables to put them back together this I want to say boarding is free though yeah yeah all the ranges from zero to and the cheapest of the ESP 8266 there are a couple dollars but then you have to buy the sensors and actuators I actually find for teaching you probably want to buy something with integrated stuff and then you can buy all these kits and plug them together and run robots and the robotic kits there's a ton of hardware out there next question so first of all in the learn site uh you're going to find some resources that are like full class classes like let's say this one that teaches you about maya numerals we also try to do activities that are not just about technology right so we can get a more diverse audience interested if you make a project out beats and bites that's going to interest that's going to interest probably the people in this room but you're already interested with you're not the target audience right but if we talk about maya numerals maybe people who are interested in history or culture are going to see the value in programming and microcontrollers so that's a whole activity and then you have actually drag the the screenshots pictures into the IDE and they will load and then you have a teacher's guide with extra information about what's being talked about and then there's we've we've done these things called activity cards and i put together a kit with a with a manufacturer and they included these activity cards 10 two-sided cards in the kit and there's things like flashlight tag and you know sound and um two button texting it uses two micro bits and use tilt to find the letters and punctuation and button a and b to to find the letters and and add and you can actually text messages directly between two micro bits for example or clues or other boards what do you mean can you code we don't want people to have to go through this hurdle that's why we're making micro blocks so you don't have to care about uh beats and uh bite codes no this is coding yeah you can you can see the ipode off codes if you want and you can build other editors to the vm if you want a text based editor on top go ahead um i'm wondering i'm familiar a bit with the micro bits and um so but what you do is you add sensors and or you put them in little overcards i think like that could yes yes if you go to the learn side again uh there's you can select the micro bit here and you'll see all these activities for the micro bit and a lot of them are using external sensors like this one uses motors to make a a micro bit robot this one uses a ready made robot car uh a lot of them use external sensors and actuators so for example you ask i deliver there's just five commands that send of the radio forward back left right and stop every time the buttons go up i stop and this one's running out of battery so the other one's faster oh we're over time okay thank you everyone", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 26.560000000000002, "text": " Let's just fetch our microblocks here, this happened to me before, why
