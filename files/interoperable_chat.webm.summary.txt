The speaker, a privacy consultant and member of the XMPB Standard Foundation, discussed the European Commission's new digital market act and its implications for big tech companies. The act designates some large companies as gatekeepers and requires them to open up their chat within a certain timeframe, with the possibility of a European standard for interoperability being drafted. The talk also highlighted the difficulties in defining "secure" in the context of end-to-end encryption and the importance of clarifying what is meant by interoperable and what functionalities will be standardised for chat. The speaker drew on their experience in chairing a standardisation group for chat in the Dutch Ministry of Health to emphasise the need for clear definitions in the standardisation process. The Q&A session touched on issues of vendor cooperation, the criteria for gatekeeper status, and the limits and challenges of standardisation in a diverse and complex technological landscape.
