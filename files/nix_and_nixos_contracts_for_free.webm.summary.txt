This talk presented the Akitoi project and the use of runtime types for addressing the lack of a static type system in NICS. It discussed how to use validator functions to check the validity of data stored in NICS and to produce recoverable errors in case of an invalid type. The Advantages of runtime types in comparison to static type systems and the useful tools of Q, dial, NICL, generative JSON and Plural NICS for those interested in implementing runtime types were also explored.
