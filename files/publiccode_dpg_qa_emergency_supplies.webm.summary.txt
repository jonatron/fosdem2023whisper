Robert Reed, the founder of Public Invention, presented a proposal for the Global Open Source Quality Assurance System (GASCOS) which aims to ensure the quality of rapidly manufactured open-source devices. GASCOS will provide a provenance tracking system for physical devices via a public open-access online database with a unique key for each box of products. This would enable third-party quality assurance testing, and reduce the burden of documentation on makers, providing confidence for buyers. Reed called for volunteers to form an open-source project to build the GASCOS system.
