In this talk, Marie Dubrom√© discussed the intersections of computer science and humanities and how digital humanists can benefit from using open source and free software. She also discussed the challenges of bringing these together, as well as the advantages of doing so, such as the receptive attitudes of digital humanists to the philosophy of free software and their access to financial resources.
