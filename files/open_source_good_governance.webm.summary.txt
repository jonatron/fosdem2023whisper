 

The OSPO Alliance was launched in 2021 by a group of four European non-profit organizations with the aim of promoting excellence in open source software management by providing a blueprint to organizations of any type and size to help them better use and manage the open source software and ecosystem. The Alliance provides different tools and activities such as software composition analysis, dependency management, vulnerability management, and executive education which are organized into five levels of maturity, and members can access resources, join calls and collaborate with other contributors in the development of the Good Governance Initiative Handbook.
