The speaker, Laura, talks about Glabra's laboratory for upstream testing and the challenges they faced while building and scaling it up. The lab uses Lava for automating the boot and deploy phases of the operating system on devices and allows to run thousands of jobs on hundreds of devices on a single instance. The lab has 217 devices of 38 different types spread across 16 racks, each rack controlled by its own server, and it is used by KernelCI and MesaCI. Laura shares some of the common issues and pitfalls they have faced and the best practices they follow to deal with them, such as writing robust health checks and isolating test shell output and kernel messages. The lab is continuously working on increasing its capacity and improving the infrastructure and monitoring tools.
