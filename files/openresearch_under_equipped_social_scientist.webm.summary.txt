The speaker, Emilien Schultz, discussed the need for scientific programming in social sciences and how it can be improved. He highlighted the diversity of practices in social sciences and the importance of flexibility and adaptability in scientific programming. He mentioned the current use of the statistical software R and the need to develop specific disciplinary packages for Python. He emphasized the potential benefits of Python, such as enhancing open source practices and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration. He also mentioned the need for facilitators and the importance of training colleagues and students. He discussed the importance of reproducibility in social sciences and the need to import tools and practices from computer science. The speaker also mentioned the Carpentries as a potential platform for teaching Python and related tools to social scientists. However, he noted the need for further research on why researchers use specific software tools and how they transition between them.
