00:00.000 --> 00:12.120
Bonjour. It's a great honor to be present among you. I'm sorry, I speak English like an average

00:12.120 --> 00:22.560
French. And I asked, obviously, I asked chat GPT and Google Translate to write me my speech,

00:22.560 --> 00:30.040
so if it doesn't work for you, it's the algorithm fault, obviously. My name is Alexis

00:30.040 --> 00:36.680
Kaufman and I'm going to present to you a forge project for all teachers and students in France.

00:36.680 --> 00:47.480
So a forge project that foes them, so what? Nothing less original. But three points in

00:47.480 --> 00:54.600
which, in my opinion, distinguish this forge from other classical forges. Users are teachers and

00:54.600 --> 01:06.760
K-12 students, so up to 18 years old for school, not for the university. Share content is educational,

01:06.760 --> 01:15.600
pedagogical content and is more text in a mock-up language than code. And last but not least,

01:15.600 --> 01:28.640
the project is supported by the French state. A few words about me. Basically, I've been a high

01:28.640 --> 01:36.480
school math teacher for 25 years, but also a kind of free software activist having founded

01:36.480 --> 01:46.560
Fremontoft 20 years ago, a non-profit organization mainly focused on free software valorization.

01:46.560 --> 01:55.440
And for years, we hoped, we, Fremontoft, we hoped for a real free software policy in

01:55.440 --> 02:04.080
French education and elsewhere and worldwide, obviously. But that did not real come. I remember

02:04.080 --> 02:12.160
10 years ago, as a president of Fremontoft, I wrote an article titled, My Ministry Drives Me

02:12.160 --> 02:19.480
to Despair, where I said this, either my ministry doesn't know that free software exists and then

02:19.480 --> 02:27.760
it is irresponsible and incompetent, or it knows it and does nothing and then it is guilty. By having

02:27.760 --> 02:34.600
such remarks publicly, you can well imagine that I would never have thought of funding myself

02:34.600 --> 02:41.920
one day in the ministry. But today times have changed. I was invited to join the ministry a year

02:41.920 --> 02:48.600
ago and I accepted the challenge. This is the first time that there is such a free software and

02:48.600 --> 02:57.160
open educational resources project manager in the institution and quite high in the organization

02:57.160 --> 03:07.080
chart. And I think it's a good sign. Another good sign, we don't just use free software,

03:07.080 --> 03:13.960
we also contribute. For example, we found a development for the open source video conferencing

03:13.960 --> 03:28.320
to Big Blue Button and it's unusual to read this in a project repose. And we contribute to other

03:28.320 --> 03:41.280
free software projects like NextCloud, Future, or Moodle. So another positive move, this project,

03:41.280 --> 03:51.080
it responds to two needs expressed by the teachers. The first is a classic one. We are nearly a

03:51.080 --> 03:59.400
million teachers in France and among them there are those who develop free software

03:59.400 --> 04:07.200
application for education and some of which have a great potential. But all these projects are

04:07.200 --> 04:15.360
scattered and it is difficult to spot them and then it's difficult to support them. And for ethical

04:15.360 --> 04:24.720
and GDPR reasons, we cannot also tell our teachers to go to Microsoft GitHub. So let's bring them

04:24.720 --> 04:35.160
together in a sovereign and secure space. And as we have computers courses from high school now

04:35.160 --> 04:44.880
in France, this also concerns students. First need, the second need corresponds to new users.

04:44.880 --> 04:54.240
Here we share a lot more formatted text, markdown, latech, then code to create educational content

04:54.240 --> 05:07.640
together. And here we create content in the dark mode image which will then be pushed into web

05:07.640 --> 05:20.520
pages, print PDF, or Jupyter Notebook. By using the pages function of the force, you can work

05:20.520 --> 05:28.840
collaboratively on the force to produce web pages, web sites with quality educational content as in

05:28.840 --> 05:35.640
this project with computer science teachers. And you can do this without leaving the web

05:35.640 --> 05:48.000
environment, without knowing Gitpush, et cetera. Another example in continuous, CI,

05:48.000 --> 06:00.920
continuous integration, we can also push markdown text into a pretty mind map as a

06:00.920 --> 06:10.800
philosophy teacher suggests here, just to emphasize that it's not just science teacher who work this

06:10.800 --> 06:23.040
way. So two needs expressed by teachers for a force of code and text. So let's do it. And the

06:23.040 --> 06:31.080
force already exists as a, as a POC, as a proof of concept since last September with 200 projects,

06:31.080 --> 06:41.000
300 accounts. It's a GitLab instance powered by a French P platform as a service, Claver Cloud,

06:41.000 --> 06:48.280
who have a stand here at FOSDEM. And administered by the Association of Teachers Association,

06:48.280 --> 06:58.200
the Association of Computer Science Teacher of France, the A-E-E-F. The big news just from

06:58.200 --> 07:06.920
10 days ago is that the project has been validated by the ministry, which has integrated it into

07:06.920 --> 07:19.640
its big strategy, the digital strategy for education 2023-2027. So the prototype force will

07:19.640 --> 07:28.560
join the IT services of the ministry. I cannot give you more details because the project is just

07:28.560 --> 07:39.200
beginning, so no roadmap, et cetera. But we have at least five years to move forward. To move

07:39.200 --> 07:47.840
forward and convince of its interest more and more teachers and students. This is the big challenge.

07:47.840 --> 07:57.720
Succeed in enlarging the cycle of users. This will require support, training,

07:57.720 --> 08:07.160
animation, and promotion of the projects submitted. Here you can see a quick and dirty

08:07.160 --> 08:14.520
swap analysis. The most important thing for me is that the project is supported by the

08:14.520 --> 08:25.640
institution and that it has values close to an event like the FOSDEM. So I have just one minute.

08:25.640 --> 08:38.280
Okay. So I don't detail the strengths, opportunities, or weaknesses. So thank you. I came to FOSDEM

08:38.280 --> 08:45.640
to present this project, but also despite my terrible level of English to discuss and see if

08:45.640 --> 08:53.240
other countries, other ministry of education in Europe, for instance, are engaged in similar

08:53.240 --> 09:04.720
projects to pool and share our experiences. Okay. Don't hesitate to talk about it around you if you

09:04.720 --> 09:10.480
think the project is interesting. And thank you very much for your attention.

09:10.480 --> 09:40.440
Thanks for your attention. If there is anyone who has a question,

09:40.440 --> 09:50.960
is there anyone who has a question in French, in English, also in chat GPT language?

09:50.960 --> 10:06.000
No, but if we have them, I can read with you a first list of positive points and some risks.

10:06.000 --> 10:17.560
So obviously the main thing is that it's an institutional project that carries values,

10:17.560 --> 10:24.120
openness, sharing ethics, sovereignty. So sovereignty is important here and sustainability. It

10:24.120 --> 10:31.320
encourages teachers and students to work together and so increase digital and computer skills,

10:31.320 --> 10:40.280
I think. And by gathering our force, join the force in the same place, it's easier to make

10:40.280 --> 10:51.600
community and obtain means. It's easier to ask money. And doing so, I hope we will have a big,

10:51.600 --> 11:01.240
a large bank of open educational content with free license and available to the entire school

11:01.240 --> 11:12.040
community. There is also a point with what in France we call it sobriété numérique,

11:12.040 --> 11:22.600
digital sobriété. I think it's not a good translation, but because we use light and open

11:22.600 --> 11:31.040
format, we can work offline. It's improved the existing rather than beginning from scratch,

11:31.040 --> 11:46.760
et cetera, et cetera. And important with the project for us is comments. So its governance

11:46.760 --> 11:51.960
and policy is shared with the users. That's very important because we did a lot of projects,

11:51.960 --> 11:58.680
a lot of top-down projects in the French Ministry of Education. These want to be more horizontal.

11:58.680 --> 12:08.200
Not very expensive, but at the beginning, but if there are more and more users with CICD,

12:08.200 --> 12:20.280
it can be different. And the threats, maybe it's a too complex tool for teachers and students

12:20.280 --> 12:29.400
if you want more and more users. So great needs for documentation, training, community

12:29.400 --> 12:40.880
animation. And convicts, great teachers who are already on forges to migrate to our force.

12:40.880 --> 12:47.760
That's a point because super teachers are already on Github, for instance.

12:47.760 --> 12:56.800
A couple of stuff. This is not clear. If the content belongs to the agents or the teacher

12:56.800 --> 13:09.080
or to the states, there is a thing to... And the evolution of GitLab offer and the competition

13:09.080 --> 13:19.520
with Microsoft Github, with Copilot, and cetera with more and more new functions. Voila.

13:19.520 --> 13:42.160
Thank you.
