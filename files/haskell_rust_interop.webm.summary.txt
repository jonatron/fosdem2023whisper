The talk is about improving interoperability between Rust and Haskell by making it easier to integrate Rust libraries into Haskell code bases. The speaker discusses the challenges of interfacing Haskell and Rust, such as the lack of a binding generation tool, and proposes a solution using a macro-based approach. They demonstrate how to generate bindings using macros in Rust, and show examples of the generated code. They also discuss handling memory management and garbage collection, and briefly touch on integrating the tooling into the build process for both languages. The speaker mentions that the library they present is small and minimalist, and concludes with a demo, which unfortunately couldn't be shown due to technical issues. In the Q&A section, they answer questions about passing function pointers between Rust and Haskell, dealing with dropped values, and generating shims for external Rust libraries.
