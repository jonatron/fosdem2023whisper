Marcel Helaja, a member of the European Parliament, discussed the Demonopolised Access to EU Applications pilot project that aims to decrease the high barrier for smaller providers and to create more choice for consumers by making EU-developed applications accessible through alternative app stores. He believes in the principle of public money, public code and stresses that EU institutions should lead by example. Hans Grossefstein, from the volunteer-led organisation F-Droid, shared his personal experience and views on the potential opportunities for the free software community that this project presents. They both suggest that the development of alternative payment ecosystems for app stores could be a possibility and encouraged involvement from the free software community to make the project succeed.
