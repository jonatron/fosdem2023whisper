In this talk at the FOSDEM conference, Danny and Maximilian from Deutsche Bahn discuss the importance of accessibility in web applications. They emphasize that accessibility is not only about people with disabilities, but about including all users. They explain the importance of using semantic HTML, landmarks, and proper order of headlines in making web applications more accessible. They also discuss the role of buttons, links, forms, and images in accessibility. They highlight the need for testing and provide tools such as Chrome developer tools and Lighthouse for accessibility testing. They conclude by suggesting the need for a CVE-like database for accessibility vulnerabilities and emphasize the importance of collaboration with colleagues and users for improving accessibility in open source projects.
