In this talk, Lewis Reville discussed how to integrate Cherry's hardware capabilities into the Rust compiler in order to better enforce memory access constraints and improve security for written Rust code. He described the features of Cherry and explained the changes needed in order to adapt the Rust compiler to better align with Cherry as well as the progress that has been made so far. He also discussed future work such as modifying the Rust libraries and testing that still needs to be done.
