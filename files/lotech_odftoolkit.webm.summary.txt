Svante Schubert discussed the ODF Toolkit, a Java-based tool for implementing the ODF file format standard used by LibreOffice and Microsoft Office. The toolkit includes an ODF DOM and a validator, and aims to close the gap between the standard blueprint and implementation. Schubert also highlighted the need for a feature API, which would allow developers to easily work with elements such as tables and images in the ODF format. The upcoming 1.3 release will include updates based on OASIS standards, and Schubert discussed a project involving extracting text from ODF files and the need for a feature model that allows for abstraction from XML details.
