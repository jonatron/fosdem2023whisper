Scott Moser from Cisco Systems discussed their internal project called Project Machine, which implements image-based workflows. As a result, they needed to change how they were running containers and did so by replacing the tar and gzip format in an OCI image with SquashFS. Moser discussed the benefits of using SquashFS, such as the DM Verity hash and the read-only file system, which is not as easily attacked as a tar ball. Moser demonstrated building images using Stacker, signing with Cosign, publishing to Zot, and running with LXC. Overall, Moser concluded that this was an evolutionary change that improved upon what was currently available.
