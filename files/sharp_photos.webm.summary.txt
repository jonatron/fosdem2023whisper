In this talk, Pavel Majek discusses different aspects of camera functionality in free and open source software development. He explains the differences between cameras and frame grabbers, and how the interface for frame grabbers is fairly simple. He talks about the shift from using hardware-intensive designs in the past to using dump sensors that do the bare minimum, and how this has led to the need for additional processing steps like auto white balance and lens shading compensation. Pavel then discusses the tools he used for camera development, including GStreamer, FFMpeg, and the Megapixels and Millipixels applications. He also explains some of the challenges he faced while working on camera functionality for devices like the PinePhone and the LibreM5, and shares his wish list for improvements in camera development, including better media control support and support for software ISP.
