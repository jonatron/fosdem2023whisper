The speaker, Giles Herron from Cisco, presented a project called Media Streaming Mesh at the FOSDEM conference in 2023. The project aims to support real-time media applications, such as WebRTC, SIP, RTSP, and live video, in Kubernetes. Herron discussed the limitations of existing solutions, including service meshes and node port, and explained how Media Streaming Mesh addresses these limitations by intercepting and redirecting traffic in a Kubernetes cluster. The project is currently in development, and the speaker encouraged contributions and feedback from the community.
