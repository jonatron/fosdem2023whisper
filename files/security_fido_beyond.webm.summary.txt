The talk introduces the audience to FIDO, a technology that uses security keys such as YubiKeys for authentication and other functions. FIDO has specifications for web authentication, as well as a protocol for using security keys called CTAP. The talk highlights FIDO's ability for attestation, which verifies that the signature was generated using a certain security key. The speaker also discusses open-source software that is compatible with FIDO, such as pluggable authentication modules and tools for large blocks storage. Finally, the speaker notes that the popularity of FIDO is increasing as more big vendors incorporate it, making it a cheaper and viable alternative to other forms of secure hardware.
