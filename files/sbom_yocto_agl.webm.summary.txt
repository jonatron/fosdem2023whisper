The speaker discusses the AGL project, which is an open source platform for different users in the car, and how they produce their S-bombs (Software Bill of Materials). They started with an in-house solution before moving upstream and using META SPDX scanner. They evaluated different tools such as phosology and SW360 and eventually added support for exporting SPDX files during the build from Yocto, which is faster and requires fewer resources. The speaker also mentions the need for tooling to present S-bombs in an easily consumable way. There is also a discussion on how to decouple the process of using phosology and reviewing the results before importing them into subsequent processes.
