In this talk at the FOSDEM conference, Amita Sharma and Justin Florey discuss the evolution of women's contribution in free and open-source software (FOSS) development. They examine the past 20 years, acknowledging challenges such as social expectations, limited opportunities, and biased growth. They also highlight the present state of diversity efforts in the FOSS community, including the emergence of DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) communities, flexible working styles, and support and mentoring programs. Looking towards the future, they emphasize the need for continued efforts in breaking down barriers, diversifying recruitment, equality in pay and recognition, and promoting leadership opportunities for women. They advocate for a mindset change and challenge attendees to think about how they can support women's growth in their own communities.
