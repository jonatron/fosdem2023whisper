In the talk given at FOSDEM, Radon Svaka presents the use of File Access Policy Statement (FEPO-CD) to harden a system. The framework allows application-wide listing and integration with RPM. It has a daemon component that listens to events from the kernel, reads data from the backend and creates its own database. The rules in FEPO-CD are similar to SC Linux, and it allows for the definition of trust by the user. Svaka also gives an example scenario of using FEPO-CD to block the execution of untrusted software.
