The speaker discusses the use of Wayland, Weston, the Yocto project, and RDP in open source software development. They explain that Wayland is a display protocol that is slowly replacing X11 and is used by many contributors to the Yocto project. Weston is one of the compositors for Wayland that is commonly used for embedded systems. RDP is a protocol that can be used for remote screen sharing in place of VNC, and it has its ups and downs. The speaker provides an example of how to configure the Yocto project to use RDP and Weston for screen sharing on an embedded device. The speaker recommends using the latest long-term support release of Yocto when possible.
