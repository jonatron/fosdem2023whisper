The talk is about the open source implementations VBank and VBDec for VVC, a new codec that provides the same quality as HEVC but at half the bitrate. VBank is an encoder project that is considered the best open source encoder, while VBDec is a decoder project. Both projects are built on top of VTM and written in C++, with support for various platforms and architectures. The development is done internally by a team at HHI, but external contributions are welcome. The projects are available on GitHub under a modified BSD3 license. The talk also mentions the ecosystem and community surrounding the projects, including FFMPEG support and integrations with various media players. The presenter highlights the optimizations and features of the projects, as well as their performance and efficiency compared to other codecs. There is also a brief mention of the advantages of VVC over AV1. Overall, the talk provides an overview of the VBank and VBDec projects, their development history, features, and the potential for community contributions.
