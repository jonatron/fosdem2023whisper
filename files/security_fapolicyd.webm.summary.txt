 

Radon Svaka presented a framework, FEPO-CD, which is a lightweight implementation of application-wide listing and includes integration with RPM and the ability to log events. It relies on the FA Notify API from the kernel, which is triggered when an external process tries to execute a system call. The framework is composed of a daemon and CLI, which manage trust and rules, respectively. Rules are similar to SC Linux, and trust is determined by user-defined trust lists. The framework can be installed via DNF, and should be debugged with the deny option for production environments. Examples were showcased to demonstrate how the framework works, including blocking an untrusted script from executing.
