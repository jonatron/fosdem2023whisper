The talk is about using lightweight Kubernetes operators with WebAssembly to lower the memory and CPU footprint of the Kubernetes control plane, particularly for edge computing. Kubernetes is not a good fit for edge computing due to its resource-hungry nature, which includes the long-running processes of operators. The solution proposed by the speaker is to use WebAssembly and the WebAssembly system interface, which creates a lightweight, super-fast sandbox for operators to run. This approach reduces the RAM usage of operators by up to 50% compared to using Docker containers, with the added benefit of less latency. The speaker's team is currently working on improving and standardizing this approach and is open to collaboration.
