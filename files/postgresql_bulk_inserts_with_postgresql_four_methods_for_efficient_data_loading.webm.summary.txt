The speaker, Ryan, talks about different methods of bulk loading data into Postgres. He starts by discussing the drawbacks of using individual insert statements and introduces the concept of bulk loading data to improve performance. He then goes on to explain four methods of bulk loading, including multi-valued insert, using arrays, copy command, and unlogged tables. He demonstrates these methods using SQL and Python, highlighting the performance differences and considerations for each. Finally, he suggests looking for certain features in SDKs, such as copy support, batching functions, and prepared statements, to further improve the bulk loading process. The speaker also briefly mentions the use of foreign data wrappers and the importance of considering partitioning and disabling constraints when appropriate.
