The speaker, Nazim Kamaltinova, discussed the Firefox profiler at the FOSDEM conference. The Firefox profiler is a statistical profiler that gives developers insight into how their applications work, capturing the backtrace of Firefox and all its threads. The profiler also has importers that allow for the analysis of different data formats. Nazim Kamaltinova went on to discuss new features and UI improvements, such as power profiling, source code view, and inline call stacks. The Firefox profiler front-end has been localized into over 15 languages, and the documentation has been refreshed. The presentation ended with a Q&A session.
