The talk is about a language called C2, which was developed to address the needs of embedded developers who were still relying on the older C language. C2 aims to keep the good parts of C while removing outdated features and improving development speed. The language includes features like modules, imports, and a built-in build system. The C2 compiler, called C2C, is designed to compile the entire program at once, allowing for better optimization and faster development. The talk also discusses the evolution of the C2 compiler, including its transition from being written in C++ to being rewritten in C2 itself. The speaker also mentions future plans for the language, such as expanding template support, changing the recipe file format to YAML, and adding more backends like LLVM.
