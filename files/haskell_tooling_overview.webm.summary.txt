The speaker, Julien DeRos, gave an overview of Haskell and its development tools, specifically cabal and the Haskell plugin for Visual Studio Code. Online tools such as Hackage and Haskell Google were also mentioned. The talk covered how to use these tools for building, testing, and documenting Haskell projects, as well as debugging and evaluating code in editors like Visual Studio Code with the use of HLS and the Haskell plugin. Additional tools such as Ripple and QuickCheck were also discussed. The Q&A included questions about the differences between cabal Ripple and GHTI, recommended debugging tools, and the various tools available for building Haskell projects.
