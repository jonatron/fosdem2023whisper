The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was a presentation about the podcast "Linux in Laws." The speakers, Chris Zimmerman and Martin Vysotsky, introduced themselves and shared how they got into open source software. They talked about the format of the podcast, which includes a mix of technical and non-technical topics, interviews with notable figures in the open source community, and a comedy-oriented segment called the "Dark Side." They emphasized the importance of listener feedback and engagement, and discussed their plans for the future of the podcast. They then interviewed Matthias Kirschner, the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe, who talked about his personal journey into open source and the initiatives of the FSFE. Finally, they announced an upcoming episode featuring a reading from Kirschner's new book, "Ada and Sangamann: A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream," which encourages children to tinker with computers and promotes software freedom.
