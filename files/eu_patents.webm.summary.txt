The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 discussed the upcoming package of patent regulations by the Commission and the need for input from the free software community. The talk focused on standard essential patents (SEPs) and the issues that arise when implementing these patents, including high transaction costs and potential abuse of dominant power by patent holders. The speaker also discussed landmark court decisions related to SEPs in Germany and the European Court of Justice. The talk then outlined five possible fixes to address these issues, including a carve-out specifically for free software, sector-specific patent regimes, competition law enforcement, clarifying the non-discriminatory and fair aspects of FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) licensing, and defining "software as such" in patent law. The audience was encouraged to get involved and contribute to the software patents campaign.
