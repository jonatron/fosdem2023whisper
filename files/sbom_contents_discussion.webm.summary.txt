The talk is about embedded Linux build systems and the need for software bill of materials (S-bombs). The speaker, an embedded software architect, discusses the simplicity of the build system they work on, but highlights missing components like external files and vendor dependencies. They also explore the use of SPDX format and the importance of recording information for provenance and vulnerability tracking. The talk ends with a discussion on how to handle vendor dependencies and the challenges of offline builds.
