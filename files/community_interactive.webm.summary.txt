The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was a game show-inspired session called "Just a Minute." Panelists were given topics and had 60 seconds to talk about them without hesitating, repeating themselves, or deviating from the topic. The topics ranged from things that make people crazy, beer, books, DevRel, and more. The panelists engaged in a lively and humorous discussion, with Dawn ultimately being declared the winner. The session aimed to provide some fun and entertainment in addition to the usual learning at the conference.
