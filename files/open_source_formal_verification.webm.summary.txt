The talk is about formal verification, which is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms using formal methods of mathematics. The speaker discusses the framework for automatic formal verification called Spark, which is both a set of tools and a language to perform automatic formal verification. Spark is a subset of the Ada programming language, which has strong specification and contract-based programming features. The benefits of using formal verification include mathematical proof that there are no vulnerabilities in your application for any possible inputs, and it can help avoid testing efforts. The speaker also gives an example of a simple piece of code and shows how Spark can be used to prove its correctness. The talk concludes with an invitation to try Spark using an online interactive website.
