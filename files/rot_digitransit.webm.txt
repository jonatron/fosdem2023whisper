[00:00.000 --> 00:24.360]  So, to have enough time for our last routing specialist now from Finland, we would start
[00:24.360 --> 00:25.360]  on time.
[00:25.360 --> 00:26.360]  Yes?
[00:26.360 --> 00:32.200]  Please, no, it's not working because it's for the camera.
[00:32.200 --> 00:35.880]  I'm screaming because we don't have an audience here.
[00:35.880 --> 00:38.360]  Yeah, it's not a microphone.
[00:38.360 --> 00:44.400]  Yeah, but yeah, let's welcome our last, more like the speaker from Finland.
[00:44.400 --> 00:45.720]  It's Joel Lappallian.
[00:45.720 --> 00:48.160]  I hope I speak your name well.
[00:48.160 --> 00:50.640]  And yeah, we are really glad to have you with us.
[00:50.640 --> 00:56.040]  Introducing Diki Transits to us, like from Finland we expect a lot because you are already
[00:56.040 --> 00:58.600]  known for great mobility solutions.
[00:58.600 --> 01:04.280]  And yeah, let's give him the chance to explain Diki Transits to us and highlight the really
[01:04.280 --> 01:30.280]  interesting components.
[01:30.280 --> 01:33.800]  Hello, hopefully you can hear me well.
[01:33.800 --> 01:35.280]  My name is Joel Lappallianen.
[01:35.280 --> 01:40.000]  I'm from Finland, a set, and I work as a developer on the OpenTrip planner and the Diki
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.760]  Transits projects.
[01:41.760 --> 01:45.640]  And today I'm here to talk about the Diki Transits project.
[01:45.640 --> 01:47.600]  So what is Diki Transits?
[01:47.600 --> 01:55.080]  It's an open source project that does multimodal public transportation, journey planning.
[01:55.080 --> 01:59.240]  It was founded in Finland around 2014 or 15.
[01:59.240 --> 02:04.520]  I have personally been working on the project since 2017.
[02:04.520 --> 02:10.800]  The goal of the project was to replace existing legacy property, journey planners, and the
[02:10.800 --> 02:17.600]  project is funded by three transportation authorities or sort of authorities in Finland.
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.160]  The project has, or the components of the projects have since been used elsewhere, for
[02:22.160 --> 02:25.120]  example in Germany.
[02:25.120 --> 02:32.200]  The project consists of user interfaces, which I'm going to talk more about in this presentation,
[02:32.200 --> 02:35.800]  and backend services and open APIs.
[02:35.800 --> 02:39.800]  So first a bit about the backend services.
[02:39.800 --> 02:44.480]  So for routing and much more, we are using OpenTrip planner.
[02:44.480 --> 02:47.760]  Hannes will have a presentation next about OpenTrip planner, so I'm not going to go too
[02:47.760 --> 02:50.520]  much into it now.
[02:50.520 --> 02:57.400]  For geocoding, we are using Pellias that we have further improved, so it deals with
[02:57.400 --> 03:00.440]  GTFS data and so on.
[03:00.440 --> 03:06.600]  And for maps, we are using this project called HSL Map Server, which uses Thileive GL and
[03:06.600 --> 03:08.600]  OpenStreetMap.
[03:08.600 --> 03:13.360]  And we also use OpenStreetMap for the geocoding as well.
[03:13.360 --> 03:15.440]  So now for the user interfaces.
[03:15.440 --> 03:20.480]  So first, this is the digit transit user interface.
[03:20.480 --> 03:25.080]  It's written in JavaScript and uses React.
[03:25.080 --> 03:30.200]  It's responsive, most of our users are on mobile devices.
[03:30.200 --> 03:40.760]  It's browser-based, and it's also meant to be, so you can use it with screen readers
[03:40.760 --> 03:44.560]  and so on.
[03:44.560 --> 03:47.680]  It's configurable, you can have different themes.
[03:47.680 --> 03:52.120]  My screenshots will be from different sites, so they will have different configurations
[03:52.120 --> 03:53.800]  and themes.
[03:53.800 --> 03:56.640]  So this is the front page on desktop.
[03:56.640 --> 03:59.000]  Here you can start the itinerary search.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.040]  You can enter origin and destination, which can be like addresses or stops or whatever.
[04:04.040 --> 04:08.280]  And you can add some favorites or use favorites for locations.
[04:08.280 --> 04:11.160]  And then you can enter these stops near you pages.
[04:11.160 --> 04:14.280]  I will display later on what this means.
[04:14.280 --> 04:21.360]  And then you have this search box for stops and routes and bike rental station and bike
[04:21.360 --> 04:23.200]  and car parks and so on.
[04:23.200 --> 04:28.440]  I won't show those views now because the time is a bit limited.
[04:28.440 --> 04:32.120]  And on the map, if I would have tuned in a bit more, there would have been more shown.
[04:32.120 --> 04:36.440]  Now it's just showing some stations.
[04:36.440 --> 04:40.960]  Okay, so these are the itinerary views on mobile.
[04:40.960 --> 04:47.080]  The view on the left, it's showing the summary of the found results.
[04:47.080 --> 04:51.560]  It's showing multiple itineraries in this view and just like a summary of those.
[04:51.560 --> 04:55.560]  The length of the legs is based on the duration of the leg.
[04:55.560 --> 05:02.240]  And we support real-time data, so the screen numbers are real-time estimates.
[05:02.240 --> 05:09.240]  And this is multimodal, so in this suggestions there's buses, trains, metros, walking, there
[05:09.240 --> 05:11.080]  could be bike rental.
[05:11.080 --> 05:16.920]  And then we have this multimodal also split into separate suggestions on the top.
[05:16.920 --> 05:22.040]  There's cycling, there could be just walking, combining cycling with public transportation
[05:22.040 --> 05:26.400]  or combining cars with public transportation.
[05:26.400 --> 05:31.160]  And on the right, the view is shown when you click open some suggestions.
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.280]  It shows more details about the suggestions and it shows the map.
[05:35.280 --> 05:40.600]  If the trip was happening right now, we could display the relevant vehicle on map for the
[05:40.600 --> 05:48.440]  suggestions and yeah, there's more details here.
[05:48.440 --> 05:52.640]  This view is the stops near you page that I mentioned earlier.
[05:52.640 --> 06:00.640]  So we did some design and discuss with real users and they found this view to be useful.
[06:00.640 --> 06:03.600]  So we have split this into like different modes.
[06:03.600 --> 06:07.520]  It shows the next departures for buses in this view, but there's another view that shows
[06:07.520 --> 06:12.240]  for example trains or metro or whatever is available in the city.
[06:12.240 --> 06:20.240]  And there's also one view that shows the departures for your fare stops.
[06:20.240 --> 06:25.400]  And these stops are the stops that are near you or a selected location.
[06:25.400 --> 06:30.800]  And on the map it will show the vehicles that travel through the stops and also the bus
[06:30.800 --> 06:37.200]  lines.
[06:37.200 --> 06:42.600]  So here's an example how this digital unit UI can be integrated into different websites.
[06:42.600 --> 06:46.640]  This is the front page for the Helsinki Regional Transportation Authority.
[06:46.640 --> 06:50.960]  On the left side, we have the same components we had in the front page from the digital
[06:50.960 --> 06:52.040]  unit UI.
[06:52.040 --> 06:55.480]  This is drawn to shared components.
[06:55.480 --> 06:57.800]  So this only acts like an entry point.
[06:57.800 --> 07:06.080]  So once user does select locations here, he or she will be redirected into the digitized
[07:06.080 --> 07:10.920]  user interface.
[07:10.920 --> 07:14.960]  And here's another example how digitized UI can be integrated.
[07:14.960 --> 07:18.840]  This is done through an iframe widget.
[07:18.840 --> 07:24.360]  There's a view which can be used to generate this iframe snippets.
[07:24.360 --> 07:30.240]  And this is for general routing, but it's also possible to have only this for walking
[07:30.240 --> 07:31.240]  or cycling.
[07:31.240 --> 07:39.120]  So the user will be redirected to the correct view.
[07:39.120 --> 07:43.000]  This is another project, another user interface.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.640]  Previously we called it virtual monitor, but now there's more called stop monitor, which
[07:48.640 --> 07:50.720]  kind of describes it better.
[07:50.720 --> 07:58.520]  So this stop monitor is meant for like businesses or private persons or public transportation
[07:58.520 --> 07:59.520]  authorities.
[07:59.520 --> 08:06.160]  So they can have this screen somewhere which displays the departures for the stops near
[08:06.160 --> 08:07.760]  that location.
[08:07.760 --> 08:13.080]  So this view is for, I should also mention that this is written with TypeScript and also
[08:13.080 --> 08:15.200]  used React.
[08:15.200 --> 08:21.200]  This view is for generating this view, the stop monitor view.
[08:21.200 --> 08:25.880]  In this you can have multiple stops on the same view and you can have multiple views
[08:25.880 --> 08:28.840]  that can rotate based on some time frame.
[08:28.840 --> 08:33.400]  So for every five seconds it will change which view is shown.
[08:33.400 --> 08:39.280]  And there's many options for layouts here.
[08:39.280 --> 08:41.240]  Here is just an example end result.
[08:41.240 --> 08:46.640]  You can have like this speed view where there's departures on the left and on the right this
[08:46.640 --> 08:53.400]  is for airport and on the bottom there's relevant alerts for that stop.
[08:53.400 --> 08:58.240]  And this stop can be modified later on, so once you have created this it's not really
[08:58.240 --> 09:04.520]  final, you can still do modifications.
[09:04.520 --> 09:09.040]  So what's next in the digitized project?
[09:09.040 --> 09:13.560]  We started the project so early on that Open Tree Planner only had version one out.
[09:13.560 --> 09:17.880]  So we are currently working on improving the support for using Open Tree Planner version
[09:17.880 --> 09:18.880]  two.
[09:18.880 --> 09:22.200]  It's already working but there's some optimizations that can be done.
[09:22.200 --> 09:27.880]  So the digitized UI that I showed it's like version two and we have version three that
[09:27.880 --> 09:31.480]  is better optimized for using Open Tree Planner two.
[09:31.480 --> 09:36.560]  And then we will have a possibility to have a map view on the stop monitor so you can
[09:36.560 --> 09:43.200]  have displayed the vehicles that are going to the stop so the user can see okay this
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.080]  vehicle is going here maybe I should start going to the stop.
[09:48.080 --> 09:51.880]  And then we will improve the support for first and last month services.
[09:51.880 --> 09:57.480]  So we have already been supporting like bike rental stations and in Germany they have added
[09:57.480 --> 10:04.880]  support for like scooter rentals, like floating vehicles and we will also focus more on like
[10:04.880 --> 10:12.360]  flexible public transportation so there's many types of services like that and this
[10:12.360 --> 10:17.920]  can include like taxis or stuff like that.
[10:17.920 --> 10:24.120]  So for more information you can visit d-transit.fi which contains some documentation relevant
[10:24.120 --> 10:32.280]  to the project and the repositories are hosted under this HSL development community GitHub
[10:32.280 --> 10:37.760]  account there's many projects there some are not digitized projects but if you search
[10:37.760 --> 10:41.920]  for digitized projects you will find the relevant ones.
[10:41.920 --> 10:48.040]  And we have this email address digitized at HSL.fi which if you send message there it
[10:48.040 --> 10:51.880]  will I will get the message.
[10:51.880 --> 10:57.560]  So thank you that was the presentation now there's time for questions if you have any.
[10:57.560 --> 11:07.280]  Yes for me it's interesting from your country that I would like to have this kind of information
[11:07.280 --> 11:08.280]  for Europe.
[11:08.280 --> 11:09.280]  Yeah.
[11:09.280 --> 11:16.040]  In community first and it would be interesting to have the best range to reach a place everywhere
[11:16.040 --> 11:24.200]  in Europe and it's not easy for the moment you have only national lines and so I remember
[11:24.200 --> 11:30.720]  it was 20 years ago when it was CEPRO with regional trains in Germany but they were slow
[11:30.720 --> 11:39.360]  and had problems with that also I know I know also to go from Brussels to Firebook in Brysgau
[11:39.360 --> 11:46.560]  in Germany it was CEPRO by the train in Germany and so on so all this kind of information
[11:46.560 --> 11:52.480]  and you plan to have to extend your project to the European level.
[11:52.480 --> 11:58.280]  So we might expand it to include Estonia for this finished project but there's still some
[11:58.280 --> 12:04.480]  issues with scaling this because if we are using multi-criteria search it doesn't scale
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.160]  to this continental scale yet on the machines we are running on.
[12:09.160 --> 12:14.320]  So there's some optimizations needed to get it work.
[12:14.320 --> 12:35.120]  This might be included in the first and last mile services I'm not quite sure on the details
[12:35.120 --> 12:40.200]  yet we are still on the like design phase on what we will support but that is an idea
[12:40.200 --> 12:48.880]  that we have discussed previously.
