The speaker, Thomas Niembooger, is discussing the OSS Review Toolkit (ORT), which is a project focused on generating and improving Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). He explains that generating a good SBOM is challenging because the input data from build tools is often incomplete. ORT resolves this issue by tracing everything back to the source code. The speaker demonstrates how to generate an SBOM using GitHub Actions and explains the importance of having a quality SBOM. He also mentions the use of policy as code to enforce compliance and security standards and discusses the challenges of including security information in SBOMs. Finally, he mentions the upcoming VEX standard, which allows for machine-readable explanations of why certain vulnerabilities are irrelevant in specific software configurations.
