The talk is about PipeWire, an open source software that allows users to share data quickly and efficiently between devices. Originally designed for screen sharing in Wayland, PipeWire now also offers audio functionality similar to that of Jack audio server, allowing users to build on existing audio solutions. The talk discusses the current status of the project, including its integration with cameras and the need for a portal service to manage permissions. The Q&A section covers topics such as network transport and the inclusion of signal processing, as well as visualizing PipeWire graphs and an AES output.
