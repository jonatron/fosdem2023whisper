In this talk, Dan from CG Race Project discussed their real-time enterprise billing suite, CG Race. The project is 100% open-source and written in Go. By integrating with existing infrastructures, CG Race can be used for telecommunication services, IOT, electricity, and other industries. APis are used for data loading, session authorization and routing, resource authorization, and other tasks. CG Race also allows for real-time or incremental billing and custom events are also supported.
