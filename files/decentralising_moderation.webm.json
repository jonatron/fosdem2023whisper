{"text": " Hello, my name is David, also known as Jorik, and I'll be your host for this session on decentralizing moderation. Most of this work was actually done by Knuxy and DeSopo. And it's a work that we have been doing for the past few years, and it started at Element. And of course, it's about the matrix network. What we want to do, we want to make moderation something that actually, and not just theoretically, works in a decentralized federated network. So what is moderation? Moderation is something that's defined by the fact that we are communicating, that there may be rules on this communication, and that we have people who enforce those rules. The moderation part is the enforcing of those rules. Again, we are talking about the matrix network. Network, the network itself, has no clue about rules. You can have many different kinds of communities. Some of them are going to be family friendly. Some of them are going to be much more adult. Some might be work specific, or sport specific, or politics specific, anything else. And each one of them can have a different set of rules. If you do not have moderation, what's going to happen? Well, this is what's going to happen. You are happily chatting with your best friends in a room, and suddenly, Marvin decides that this room must be spammed with stinky French garlic spam. Who wants stinky French garlic spam in their room? I don't. This is where the moderator needs to step in, most likely kick Marvin away, or at least have a stern talking to Marvin, and get rid of the spam content. Of course, I'm talking about spam, but in the real world, it can be much, much worse than spam. I leave this open to your imagination. As mentioned, we're talking about federation. In this case, it means that we have users who connect to one communication room from a number of servers. For instance, today, listening to this presentation, I'm going to assume that some users are connecting from foestem.org, some from matrix.org, and presumably from a number of other servers. It means that the servers need to agree upon who is a moderator with the authorization to kick bad users and to get rid of bad content. That is something that the matrix network already handles. That's part of the specification. However, things can quickly become complicated. You don't have a single room on a server. You can have users who participate in multiple rooms, can be moderators in some of them, and not moderators in others. You can also have moderators who come from different home servers and who share the moderation burden and the moderation privilege in a number of rooms. That's possible. Typically, in the matrix network, you go one step further by introducing moderation rooms. Rather than having the moderators operate directly in the room they're moderating, they are members of a moderation room. In this moderation room, they use a bot to whom they have delegated the moderation abilities to perform the day-to-day actions. When Alice or Fred wish to kick Marvin, they ask Mjolnir, the name of the bot, to do this on their behalf. This has a number of advantages. One of them is that if Alice and Fred are moderators for many rooms, they only need to kick Marvin once if they need to kick him from all the rooms. They can also publish and share policy rooms. This is how we get into the even more federated part. Those policy rooms are what let rooms and communities work together to define rules, to define users who have been banned for being toxic and abusive or spammy and who should not put their foot anymore into any of those rooms. Generally, that is one step further in the federation of moderation itself. What you already have with Mjolnir, you have those moderation rooms which can again moderate a number of individual rooms, so entire communities. You have those moderation policies that you can publish, you don't have to, and you can share again federation between those communities. You also have the side benefit that moderators can operate with some degree of anonymity, which is good because we have seen a number of cases in which there are reprisals against moderators when they try to apply the rules. So at this stage, hey, we have decentralized moderation. Well thank you for coming and listening to this presentation. It was a very brief presentation, but it was a very intense one, so thank you. If you have any questions, oh, before I forget, yeah, if you want to use Mjolnir, you need to install it. It's not very hard, there are just six easy steps, I'm not going to read them out loud, and then you can use Mjolnir, sorry, I meant 10 steps, 10 easy steps, and then you can use Mjolnir, 16 easy steps. I mean, who doesn't know how to configure engines or pantalymons, right? But after these 21 easy steps involving Docker compose, these 23 steps, are we done yet? Yes, we're done. So after these 23 steps, the 24th step says that you can now start becoming a moderator for those rooms. It's great until you read step 25, which says that if you want to do this with another set of rooms, you have to repeat everything. That is a bit complicated, especially since moderators are typically, I mean, yes, some moderators are highly technologically literate, but some aren't, and they don't need to, or at least they shouldn't need to. So the main issue at this stage when we talk of decentralizing moderation is about democratizing moderation. How do we do that? Well that's the entire point of project Mjolnir for all, which has been developed by Knuxy and Jezopo. And before I proceed, I would like to continue with a public service announcement. If you know employers or potential employers for two highly passionate and high level developers, please get in touch with them, or with me. So what would we like at this stage? We would like something simple, something that does not involve the 25 steps mentioned earlier. We would like to simply be able to invite Mjolnir, confirm that it's the moderator, and be done with it. So can we do that? Let's see how this works. Here we are, me and my best pal having a chat in our very own very interesting room. And just in case, I'm going to set up decentralized moderation for this room. So let's invite the Mjolnir bot. This creates two rooms, one of them that is going to be useful for sharing policies. In case I want to cooperate with other moderators, for instance, and we have a common base of people who wish to kick, and a moderation room in which we can actually use Mjolnir. Let's not forget one thing. We need to make sure that our moderator can moderate. With this, the moderator is no in position of moderating. And if someone were to, say, send some spam, oh no, spam has arrived. Well we should do something. Okay, I'm not going to do something right now because I'm not planning to demonstrate all the features of Mjolnir, or of Mjolnir for all. But we are no in a position where we can do something about it. So we can kick, we can ban, etc. The objective here is to ship Mjolnir for all with home servers. Let's face it, there is still a difficulty involved in setting up Mjolnir for all as the administrator. And this difficulty, I would like to consider, is part of the difficulty of setting up the home server. Of course, it can also be shipped as standalone. But as you have seen, if the administrator of the home server or the administrator of the Mjolnir for all does the necessary steps to set this up, moderators can do something well, they don't need to set up anything. It's just two clicks version. They just need to invite Mjolnir and confirm that Mjolnir is entitled to moderation rights. We even have a prototype of a user interface that does this with a button in element. I'm not going to demonstrate it here because I'm going to run out of time. But that works too. At this stage, Mjolnir for all doesn't implement the entirety of features of Mjolnir. It's pretty close, but that would need to be finished. And once we have all of that, well, this can entirely transform the experience for communities. Because creating a community is just something that you can do by creating a new room, possibly creating a space and inviting Mjolnir for all. And you're done. None of these messy 25 steps of installation of Mjolnir. There is one more problem that I'd like to talk about. Whether it's in a federated world or in a non federated world, at some point you will need to call for help. Possibly because you have just witnessed Marvin publishing some French garlic stinky spam in the room, possibly because you are a victim of abuse, bullying, harassment or witness of some. And you wish to attract the attention of moderators on that so that they can do something about it. In the current flow, well in element, but it's basically the same thing with other metrics clients, what do you do? You click on report, you write a few words to explain that what's going on and you wait for something to happen. As you'll see, in many cases, you can wait for a long, long time. Because on the other side, how do you get access to these goals for help, also known as moderation requests? Well, the official workflow in Synapse is the following. First you need to create an admin account. It's documented but not standard. Then you need to write your program to pull a REST API, which is also documented and also not standard. Then you're going to see the requests, assuming that your program works and you can do something about it. But that's not really ideal, right? Because first you need to be the admin to get the moderation requests. And then you need some custom program, surely that's not how it works. So for one year and something, we've had a new flow in Muernier to replace that. You need to install engines, you need to set it up, you need to set up Muernier for that. And instead of having to write a custom tool, you're going to see the requests in the room, in the moderation room, which is infinitely better. But it's still not good enough because you need to install the engines for one thing and because that's only for one home server. That's still in this paradigm in which you have only one community per home server. And as we have seen, that's not the case. It gets worse because to receive the call for help, you'd better hope that the user is connecting from the same home server as an administrator who can do something about it. If, for instance, you are in this room, which I believe is a FOSDEM or .org room, I mean the room in which you may be listening to this presentation. I'm going to assume that all the moderators and all the people who can do something have accounts on FOSDEM.org. This might not be true, but for the example, let's say that it is. If you are sending a call for help from an account on matrix.org, then this call for help is going to be received by administrators for matrix.org. And if none of the administrators for matrix.org can do anything about FOSDEM.org, for instance, because they're not members of the room and they do not have moderation rights in this room, well, in that case, they can do nothing about it. So that is still broken. On the upside, that's why what we've been working on, let me tell you about Project Aristotle, which is one brick that interacts with Muir near for all to implement this call for help in a decentralized world. In this case, that is my work. And the public announcement made by my colleagues is true for me, too. So what do we want? We want to take advantage of Muir near for all so that whenever someone calls for help, the moderator in the room for which help has been requested gets the information. Moderators, of course. And these are the people who can actually act upon the situation. Let's see how that works out in the current state of things. I'd love to tell you that we have already reached the stage at which this feature is fully streamlined and integrated into everything. It's not quite the case yet. In the current state, we first need to inform Muir near that we want to do this Aristotle decentralized moderation in our room. And the second thing we need to do is inform element client that we want to opt in for this new feature, which is called report moderators. But once this is done, we can look at that spam. Oh, no, there is spam and report it. This is spam. I don't want no stinky French garlic in my room. And send the report. One thing you may notice if you have recent reports is that we are actually confirming that it has been sent to the moderator. And also, this report now shows up for all the moderators in the rooms instead of only showing up for the home server admin who might or might not be in good position to do anything about it. And let's end, you know, the moderator has, without having to do anything, a very complicated, kicked Marvin from the room and removed the offending message. The reason for which Aristotle is not entirely streamlined yet is because, at the moment, it uses non-standard extensions to the matrix plural. These extensions are pretty simple. They have been submitted for standardization, but they're not part of the standard yet. Once they are, it becomes possible to enable them by default in element and in other clients to enable them by default in merely a role, which means that all the messy parts about setting up the room and setting up element to do that will disappear. And users can simply call for help using a much more streamlined mechanism that actually gets the request for help to the person who can do something about it. Now, let's take a step back. The development of Mjolnir for all and Aristotle is very advanced, but it's not entirely finished. So it's still need a little work. This is work that started its life in the former trust and safety development team at Element. Right now, it lives at the address I'm giving you on this slide. And my hope is that it's going to continue living and progressing because I believe that it can make a whole lot of change for users on matrix network and possibly even on other networks. Well, we are reaching the end of this presentation. I would like to thank you all for listening to this point. As mentioned previously, if you know potential employers for highly passionate developers who enjoy working on privacy, open source and distributed computing, please do not hesitate to get in touch. These are all our GitHub handles, but you can also find us on matrix that shouldn't be too hard. Thank you very much and have a good day.
