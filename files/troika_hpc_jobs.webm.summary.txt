The talk was about Troika, a system developed by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts to manage and submit jobs to HPC systems. Troika is a workflow manager that interacts with job submission systems through a single interface. It allows users to easily submit, monitor, and kill jobs on various HPC systems using a configurable Python-based software. The speaker discussed the challenges faced by the organization in running their operational weather forecasting services and various research and support workflows. They highlighted the benefits of using Troika to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and reproducibility in job submissions. The speaker also discussed future plans for Troika, such as supporting more queuing systems and improving script generation.
