00:00.000 --> 00:14.280
Thanks. Hi. Can I start it? Okay. My name is Laszlo Nemet and the presentation, the title

00:14.280 --> 00:23.320
of the presentation, Fun Project by Design. The short summary of my presentation, I don't

00:23.320 --> 00:27.760
know if all LibreOffice development can be full of flow, but I can show the best moment

00:27.760 --> 00:37.280
of my recent developments. So, my motto from Goethe, mehr Licht, more light, and in the

00:37.280 --> 00:45.840
end I hope I can give more light about LibreOffice development or fun around LibreOffice development.

00:45.840 --> 00:52.240
First one, I work it on improving the spelling dictionaries or spell checkers, two in the

00:52.240 --> 01:00.200
last few weeks and months, and here there is a Wikipedia one-liner I use to extend the

01:00.200 --> 01:04.880
spelling dictionaries, pushing the word text of the Wikipedia, for example, the Hungarian

01:04.880 --> 01:11.960
in my case, to a UNIX pipeline and ranking their entries of the dictionary in the case

01:11.960 --> 01:20.480
of the Hungarian, there was 400,000 entries with a very huge variant of the different

01:20.480 --> 01:27.120
localization of the Wikipedia and counting their backlinks, and after that we have a data

01:27.120 --> 01:34.080
about the frequency of the entries and we can filter the unknown words for the spelling

01:34.080 --> 01:40.520
dictionary. Here is the one-liner. I was so excited to show, to see the Wikipedia example

01:40.520 --> 01:47.160
from the download from the dump Wikipedia.org that this is five billion characters in a

01:47.160 --> 01:58.760
single PC, as 50,000 books, the text content of this single file, and it was able to create

01:58.760 --> 02:04.440
a frequency database immediately. I called my son that, check this, this is the prototype

02:04.440 --> 02:11.600
of the one billion dollar algorithm of Google, the page rank. Wow, why, so wonderful. He

02:11.600 --> 02:21.120
said that it's a little late, but no problem because it's no late for me. I know the UNIX

02:21.120 --> 02:27.080
pipeline, the history of the UNIX line, why so? It started with the moon landing. I know

02:27.080 --> 02:31.800
the history of the graph, so it's related to the language analysis of the federalized

02:31.800 --> 02:39.280
papers, the founders of the United States. There was a guy, MacMahon, a linguist working

02:39.280 --> 02:45.560
in the Bell Laboratory, so it's a history, but it's a present, so that is why interesting

02:45.560 --> 02:51.960
that in the liberal office development, like the OpenOffice.org was the first big office

02:51.960 --> 02:59.520
suite built on the Solaris system, SunMicro system, developed this with big joy, and I

02:59.520 --> 03:05.480
used the VI editor and the modification by a Dutch face-off developer, Ben Maulner,

03:05.480 --> 03:14.240
the VI version, so it's a history, but the present, too, and this is the result related

03:14.240 --> 03:22.120
to the Hungarian dictionary, and it seems that humans just want to have more fun because

03:22.120 --> 03:30.520
check the most frequent new unknown words, McLaren or all musics, or soccer, football,

03:30.520 --> 03:37.240
and car racing, et cetera, but there was, in the first, the most frequent dozen words,

03:37.240 --> 03:43.680
there was an exception as Misfit, Nauchni, a small Ocarina village with 1,000 people,

03:43.680 --> 03:51.880
only 1,000 people. Why? So I checked the Wikipedia, and this was the place of the Crimean astrophysical

03:51.880 --> 04:03.600
observatory, and it is a huge number, near 3,000 links in the Wikipedia for the Nauchni,

04:03.600 --> 04:13.800
the village, show me that it means thousands of asterite stars, galaxies, this co-ed in

04:13.800 --> 04:20.200
this observatory in the last 100 years, so it was a nice experience. I added some other

04:20.200 --> 04:28.200
words, not this one, to the Hungarian dictionary, for example, Higgs, the physician related

04:28.200 --> 04:34.000
to the gravitational waves, or Thaisetarovs, because this extinct animal is the most popular

04:34.000 --> 04:43.560
in the young age people, toddlers, so sometimes useful. The other development, the Soros language,

04:43.560 --> 04:52.320
is a mini-language to handle a problem, that converting digits to a written form, the words

04:52.320 --> 05:01.960
of a number, for example, Euro to French, I'm sorry for my French, but I don't want

05:01.960 --> 05:10.520
to pronounce the French version, but I'm sure there are people here who can help me later,

05:10.520 --> 05:15.320
and this is the history of the Soros language, it's related to the software patients, because

05:15.320 --> 05:23.520
that was in Microsoft XMS standardization as very special Excel function, the bot text,

05:23.520 --> 05:31.240
using converting numbers to Thai language, that was maybe Chinese suggestion in the open

05:31.240 --> 05:38.080
formalities to create a more generalized version, a number text, but the answer from the open

05:38.080 --> 05:45.080
office dot developer study, developer, that was defining a general purpose number, this

05:45.080 --> 05:51.000
would be a nightmare, he had the experience, it's really a nightmare, and a few years later

05:51.000 --> 05:59.280
I made one liner in the UNIX tool, a prototype to create something useful and mini-language

05:59.280 --> 06:06.040
to describe the different grammar rules of the languages, and the first version within

06:06.040 --> 06:13.520
a week or I don't know, supported the English, Thai, German, Hungarian, Italian language,

06:13.520 --> 06:19.720
and a very special numbering system, Shuzo numbers, which in the night is still used

06:19.720 --> 06:26.360
by the Chinese market, two lines of the numbers with the magnitude of the number, for example,

06:26.360 --> 06:38.280
30's number is 2023, and the next line contains the 1,000 year sign, the best, the worst problem,

06:38.280 --> 06:44.000
so it's not so far the development, that this was a spin-off of my grammar checker development

06:44.000 --> 06:53.880
support, founded by the FSF.HU foundation, but that time with three small children without

06:53.880 --> 06:59.280
too much money, it was a crazy idea for me to create a new development, so that is why

06:59.280 --> 07:06.520
I asked the NNET foundation, help of the NNET foundation, and later the 1-1 development

07:06.520 --> 07:14.920
resulted in 11 new language support in the software, and the interesting thing here,

07:14.920 --> 07:22.960
that when I made a C++ version from this project, it was also funded by an FSF.HU foundation,

07:22.960 --> 07:31.840
I've got help from Ekaterinatke, at that time a LibreOffice developer, and later with the

07:31.840 --> 07:37.360
Russian developer, Maiko Gonski, from Kolabora, and now if you check the new features of

07:37.360 --> 07:46.240
the LibreOffice, you will try to, you will check the, it's possible to select this format,

07:46.240 --> 07:51.680
you will number formats in the dialogue windows, so useful, and this was the two characters

07:51.680 --> 07:59.840
fixed, I wasn't able to fix five years ago, ago because my, related to my complexity of

07:59.840 --> 08:04.720
my development, LibreLogo, a special language, but not only for children, I will check the

08:04.720 --> 08:10.440
next example, this line, fix the SVG export with the special font features, open type

08:10.440 --> 08:17.120
and graphite, graphite, so you can use, for example, Xpaves, the special generated graphics.

08:17.120 --> 08:22.960
For the books, I improved the type setting, the paragraph line breaking algorithm, adding

08:22.960 --> 08:28.960
the hyphenation zone of the OXMS standard, and this standard helped create more DTP like

08:28.960 --> 08:34.880
text in LibreOffice, my plan to create something better, things for picture books, thank you

08:34.880 --> 08:41.960
very much, this is the mascot of the LibreLogo development I made last night, the idea is

08:41.960 --> 08:51.120
quite new, new, and solving a thousand years problem that, what is this, log or the crocodile,

08:51.120 --> 08:59.680
both of them, log, the LibreLogo crocodile, so 400 bucks fixed in the last four and half

08:59.680 --> 09:05.600
year for by me, using special methods to mix the Unix programming language or the approach

09:05.600 --> 09:16.960
to finding the freedom in these developments, so you like bug fixing, you can see new features,

09:16.960 --> 09:24.760
a language, for example, 200 years, and the famous Hungarian poet, Shantel Petriti, made

09:24.760 --> 09:34.880
a very short poem, you can read later, and this poem is from Goethe, and related to Tesla,

09:34.880 --> 09:43.120
who made the biggest innovation in Budapest, thanks to Goethe, this is the end of my development,

09:43.120 --> 10:06.080
and you can check the numbers and the downloader, thank you very much.
