The speaker discusses the importance of optimization and the different ways to optimize Go functions through measuring benchmarks, reducing allocations, function inlining, escape analysis, and concurrency. They emphasize that optimization should be tailored to the specific needs of the program and to not guess but rather measure everything. The talk offers various examples of optimization but also stresses the importance of trade-offs in optimization. The speaker also provides references for further learning on optimization in Go.
