In this talk, Mathieu Goetje discusses Djubaco, a new archive format independent of the Qwix project. It is a meta container that allows users to include metadata and select which content to compress. With a range of features, such as selective compression and random access, Djubaco introduces a new way of thinking about the use of archives and could be used for a variety of applications, such as web development, file archives, file formats, websites, backups, and embedded resources.
