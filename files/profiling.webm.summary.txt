The talk is about continuous profiling in the context of observability. The speaker discusses the common goals of observability, such as ensuring successful user journeys and proactively identifying problems. They explain the use of logs, metrics, and distributed tracing as observability signals. Then, they introduce profiling as another signal that can help understand code behavior and identify performance bottlenecks. They explain how profiling works, including the measurement of code execution time and memory allocation. They also discuss different methods and tools for profiling, such as SDKs, agents, and the use of open-source projects like Grafana's Flare. The speaker concludes by mentioning profile-guided optimizations and potential future developments in profiling tools. In the Q&A section, various questions are asked about profiling in multi-threaded code, other profiling formats, integration with CI/CD, combining traces with metrics, and more.
