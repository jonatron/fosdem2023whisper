{"text": " So, hi everyone, welcome to my talk, welcome to Bearbox and first of all, can all of you raise your hands who ever heard of Bearbox or, okay, that's quite some, and who use it actually in some projects? Okay, that's more than I thought. Okay, as I thought, I'm Marco, I'm from Pentatonix, I'm an embedded software developer, yeah, my tasks are related to kernel, to bootloader, to BSP stuff, graphics stuff and so on and so on. Most of the time I contribute my work to upstream, sometimes not. I live in the north of Germany, yeah, and that's it. And again, there is just a brief introduction to Bearbox who is not becoming familiar with, and then let's add a new driver, so an example, then add a new board so you can see how you can add your own board and upstream it to Bearbox because we always welcome new boards, and then we make a short hands-on, hopefully we have some time for it. And yeah, okay, then welcome to Bearbox. Bearbox started in the 2007 as a patchlet of Uboot, and the patchlet was called Uboot v2. This patchlet was retracted, and then, yeah, Sasha renamed it and here, made an official fork of it in 2009. We have monthly releases, we have mainline support in PDX test, and we have mainline support in BuildWood, and we wanted to have mainline support in Yocto and Open Embedded Core. I sent patches just yesterday, you can find the link below or in the slides. Please, any discussion is welcome. And if it's not getting into Open Embedded Core, yeah, you can pull it from Meta PDX or Meta Bearbox. And okay, yeah, we have 330 contributors around, and yeah, it sounds not that much, but we are living, Bearbox is living, we have around 1,400 commits per year, and okay, the graph is not that optimal, it would be, yeah, wise all the time, but yeah, 1,400, it's not that bad. And we are alive, so let's add a new driver. And what are our design decisions in Bearbox? We are coming from Linux, we don't want to re-render the third time or the tenth time, so we are taking the Linux device driver model and stripping it down to bootloader use case. All the configuration is done via device tree since day one, since we get forked, and yeah, device tree and Kconfig, some of it, most of it, device tree, and we also, since we re-use the Linux device driver model, we also re-use the driver frameworks. We just strip it down to met our requirements and then push it, and it's mostly just in copy and paste with small adaptions. So then, let's add a new driver. As I said, it's in copy and paste, copy it from the Linux source, copy it to the Bearbox source, and then adapt the code. So how does it look? And some example, I took the clock from some workshop, and I made a div, you can see the div above, it's Linux 6.1 or 6.2, so it's 6.2, blah, blah, and yeah, just adapt the headers, because, okay, of course, Bearbox does not have all those headers, and replace them with some Bearbox headers, and then replace some functions we do not support. That's not very important, it's just replace some functions, remove it, or replace it, yeah. So we adapted the driver, we are finally done. So we have ported our new clock driver for this workshop. So we have changed 50 lines of code for a driver of size about 171 lines of code. This makes about one percent or two percent of adapted code, and we ported the driver to Bearbox to a bootloader. Most of the time, when you port a driver, clock drivers are a bit specific, but some drivers do IRQ, and Bearbox, we don't have IRQs, so you need to port it to some polling mechanism, but we have helpers for that. So we are welcome you to port your driver, or your driver of choice you need into a bootloader. So then, after we ported the driver, we need to compile it. So let's add a K-config in the makefile, because we are kernel-related bootloader. So let's add a K-config menu entry, and at the makefile, it looks like a kernel. So then we are finally done. We need to enable it, we need to compile it, and we have everything. And of course, we can test it with what? With the Linux device tree, because we are the device tree based, and we, since we are using the complete driver from Linux, we also have the complete bindings from Linux. So we can use the upstream Linux device tree. You don't have to do anything, just copy and paste. So yeah, feels like writing a kernel driver, isn't it? To me, at least. So to sum up this a bit, the Bearbox drivers are just a stripped-down Linux version driver, and drivers can be ported with little effort. There may be some more effort if you have more complex drivers, or if you port frameworks. But by frameworks, that really depends. There are some really easy frameworks, and there are some frameworks which are huge. So I added some examples, which frameworks we already support. A very decent one is the NetDSA. I think some of you know the DSA stuff, this distributed architecture for switches. I think it's called distributed switch architecture, anyway. And we support it in Bearbox, because we are using the NetDSA framework from Linux. So we can do NetDSA with bootloader, so you can speak with your switch like you do in Linux. So that's very impressive for a bootloader. And yeah, then let's move on. We have added our driver. Let's move on and add a new board. Before we can add a new board, I wanted to explain you some stuff, some internals of Bearbox. I don't want to go into details, because we don't have that much time. If we have more time at the end, I will show some more examples. And yeah, of course, you can raise your hand if you have questions in the end. Anyway, we have a single binary in Bearbox, which you flash to the target. But this is composed of several components. One of it is the socketer. This is really, yeah, one of it is the socketer. Then we have this prebootloader. Then we have some firmware blobs like device tree, like third-party firmware blobs, TFA or ATF or DDR firmware. Yeah, depends on your socket also. And then we have the actual bootloader. So as you can see, there is a singleton image, but it's composed of different firmwares or different blobs. In Bearbox, we do this composing for the prebootloader and for the firmware and for the actual bootloader, we do a link it together. And the socketer is appended. So, yeah, also the socketer is very search-specific. And this appending mechanism depends on this image creation tool, which is also so specific. So then also some booting stuff need to be known before you can add the board. Most or most modern socks are booting from a bootworm. So you plug in the check and then the bootworm comes up. The bootworm loads some stuff from, yeah, the boot medium you configured via some GBIOs or some pins. And then it's loading the, yeah, some kilobytes into some static RAM. And then it jumps to the static RAM and then executes the reboot loader and then the bootloader and the bootloader finally decrypt. So now look into deeper and add a new board. So as I said, the bootworm is loading this socketer. It's decoding this socketer. It's really search-specific and it's executing the software which was loaded from the boot medium. Then the reboot loader gets loaded by the bootworm and set up the DRAM. And then it's loading the real bootloader to the DRAM after it set it up to DRAM. And then it jumps to the actual bootloader. Or if you have some more decent socks like RV8 based socks, then it's jumping to the TFA and the TFA is jumping to the bootloader which we previously loaded to the DRAM. So, okay, now we know it and now we add the reboot loader stuff. The reboot loader stuff don't have any support of device fee or so. It's a kind of low level stuff. It's kind of dirty stuff. Anyway, in Bellbox, everything starts at the entry function. The entry function is always the first point where it starts. And, okay, let's add iMix 8MN EVK with this entry function. We have some helper functions after we load it into the DRAM. And then we are calling the NXP. This is some bot specific code which we get here. And this set up the UART. So, we have a reboot loader low level debug stuff. And then as the function calls start ATF, this function set up the DDR as I said. It loads the Bellbox to the DRAM or DDR and starts the TFA. And the TFA is then jumping into the loaded image or into the given image, into the image which we loaded previously at the specific address we told TFA. And after we loaded this, we get started by this last function and that's the actually Bellbox entry function. And here you can see the reboot loader is passing the device tree. So, the reboot loader contains also loaded the device tree and is passing the device tree finally to Bellbox. So, Bellbox is just running with the device tree. So, now let's come into the Bellbox to the boot lawyer. This is the stuff where all the magic happens, where all your bot specific fix ups does happen. Like you have some overlays for some displays, you have different displays, do some detection and then apply device tree overlays. So, your device tree is finally finished, finally fixed up for the kernel and the kernel don't have to do anything. This can, such stuff can happen in the board code. And yeah, such a board code is also a driver in Bellbox and after the board code finished to load everything and do all the magic, it jumps to the kernel. So, as you can see here, this is the entry function for a board code. Again, this looks again for me to a kernel, like a kernel driver. You have some driver structure where you can put all the functions and you have this computable which is also checked and then depending on the computable which is given, the driver is loaded or executed or not. And then you have the board function and within the board function you do this magic stuff, I told you. You do detect where to come from, do some magic stuff and set up. This is some kind of special in Bellbox. We have some Bellbox update handler. This is some kind of, yeah, you know this magic in the Submarine where you can have some scripts to load something from MMC to some magic addresses and here are magic addresses and here are magic addresses and there are involved five commands or so. In Bellbox we have the Bellbox update command and this is the handler for it. We just forget the handler and in Bellbox we can just call Bellbox update and finished. So, there is just one command involved. And yeah, then finally the board code is fixing up the file and then it, yeah, finished and starting the kernel. And the kernel is do all the remaining stuff. So, that's not part of my talk. And yeah, okay. So, we have added a driver, we have added a new board and everything apart, the pre-boot loader stuff feels like a kernel to me. So, I hope I can make you a bit excited about you can visit the link. This is a Bellbox hosted online on the tiny emulator. Yeah, just click on it and you can try it out. Yeah, what else? Bellbox. Bellbox has, now it's coming to the improved part. Bellbox has a rich shell with auto-completion. This shell has history. This shell supports scripting and so on. This shell is also called what you would see when you visit the link. What do we have also? We do also have 30FI systems. This means no more commands and offsets like you know from Reboot. It's just copy A to B. It's like Unix. It's like Linux. So, we have LS, we have RM, we have AutoMount. You know AutoMount from system D where you visit some directory and magic happens and it gets mounted automatically. We also do have that in our bootloader. And we also have memory mapped IO access. So, we can visit it or we can check the memory. We can manipulate the memory via MD, via memory write. So, MV. And yeah, as I said earlier, we have this Bellbox Update command, which is pretty amazing because it's hiding all the ugly stuff. It's just Bellbox Update and you are done. And also pretty amazing in Bellbox. We have multi image support. It's some language of Bellbox. It's something you are compiling Bellbox. And then with one compile, with one dev config, we can build 100 or more boards. And this is something I wanted to show you right now with enhanced one. So, now it's, I hope everything works as expected. So, yes. Is it readable or should I increase the size? Okay. So, it's just a small script I wrote. It does nothing. Just, it applies, make dev config, then it enters the dev config. So, I can show you something about Bellbox. So, it's like, again, it's like a Linux kernel. And here you can see system types. And here you can see all the boards we have enabled. So, all the boards, not just one board. And, okay, exit. Yeah, everything is fine. And then it's calling make compile. So, okay, that's nothing fancy here about. The fancy starts at the end. Let that happen. And, hopefully. So, okay, now we are at the end. We are finished compiling all these stuff. And now we are building our images. And we are building around, as I said, we are building around 100 images right now with one command, with one dev config. And that's pretty amazing, because I know how some, or I know BSPs where you have just two different Uboot configs to have one Uboot for an SD card and one Uboot for an EMMC or one Uboot for on spy and one Uboot for an SD. That's not the kind we are working. We are saying one image will all them. So, and then also you compile it and you can select as many boards as you want. As soon as, yeah, it has some limitation. This must be the same. So, we, or the architecture. So, this was it. I mix seven. Sorry, I mix four, seven. So, all I mix six and so on and so on. And now we can see cat. So, now I can demo build flash images. So, we have built 132 images just in one minute. And that's not doable with Uboot, at least with my knowledge, I can't do it with Uboot. And yeah, of course, then as I said, we have this, or if it would work, yeah, we have this online barebox. And then we also have an editor. We have also VI, but VI is not that good working within the web. But we have also added and then we can edit some stuff like going here and hitting blah blah or ha ha. Anyway, as you could have seen this script. And Uboot first time. It's nothing special. It's just a script which checks some environment variable. And then that's it. I want it just half an hour ago. And then we can handle this and see, okay, global first time ref is not set. And then we can say, okay, since we have history, we can move up. And I didn't edit it. Okay, then we say global first time ref. Oh, nope. Also auto completion. So global first time ref. And then Uboot first time. And then we say hello first time 20, yeah, 23. And yeah, that was a short head on. It's pretty amazing barebox. I really, I really would like it to see you if you have contributed barebox, if you send patches, if you bring your board to mainline and let us enjoy barebox.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.6, "text": " So, hi everyone, welcome to my talk, welcome to Bearbox and first of all, can all of you", "tokens": [50364, 407, 11, 4879, 1518, 11, 2928, 281, 452, 751, 11, 2928, 281, 19836, 4995, 293, 700, 295, 439, 11, 393, 439, 295, 291, 51244], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4189254910338159, "compression_ratio": 1.4, "no_speech_prob": 0.33172374963760376}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 17.6, "end": 25.240000000000002, "text": " raise your hands who ever heard of Bearbox or, okay, that's quite some, and who use it", "tokens": [51244, 5300, 428, 2377, 567, 1562, 2198, 295, 19836, 4995, 420, 11, 1392, 11, 300, 311, 1596, 512, 11, 293, 567, 764, 309, 51626], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4189254910338159, "compression_ratio": 1.4, "no_speech_prob": 0.33172374963760376}, {"id": 2, "seek": 2524, "start": 25.24, "end": 34.12, "text": " actually in some projects?
