In the talk, Sebastian, the CTO of Enclave, discusses their mission to simplify confidential cloud computing with their open source project, the Base. He explains the concept of enclave technology, which encrypts user space memory to shield data, workloads, and application codes from the infrastructure, and the role of Intel SGX in achieving it. He discusses the challenges developers face in implementing enclave technology and suggests a simpler approach with the Base, which contains pre-built enclaves for various applications. Additionally, he talks about their contribution to the Portainer project, aiming to further simplify the development of enclave applications. Finally, he encourages the community to join their open source project and use Enclave.Cloud for confidential cloud computing.
