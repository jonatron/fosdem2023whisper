This talk at FOSDEM was given by Sebastian Holtzab, an embedded systems engineer, about his side project on Eurorack systems. Eurorack is a modular system for building hardware electronic music synthesizers, and Holtzab has designed hardware and software to make it easier to integrate FPGAs into Eurorack systems. He also created a plugin for BCV Rack to simulate FPGA code and link it to a modular synthesis system. He is considering a manufacturing run for his revision 3 hardware design, and encouraged people interested to start a GitHub repository.
