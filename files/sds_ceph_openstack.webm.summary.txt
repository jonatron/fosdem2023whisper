Francesco's talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about Obestac and self-integration in the Kubernetes world. He discussed the integration of SAF into the system, the status of the app, changes with SAFADM in the Bermadal world, and the benefits of having Kubernetes in this picture. He focused on orchestrating services, deploying ObjectStack and SAF together, and provided a demo linked in the session. He also discussed Manila's improvements using CefADM's driver to interact with its components. Francesco briefly touched upon Rook as a way to deploy SAF within Kubernetes regardless of how Obestac is deployed. He emphasized the need for tuning in the HCI world to make sure that both clusters and connections are valuable for the outside workload.
