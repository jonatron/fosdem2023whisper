The talk given at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about using LLVM for developing embedded toolchains. The speaker explained that embedded toolchains are used for bare-metal embedded systems and highlighted the differences between developing on operating systems like Linux and developing for embedded systems. They discussed the advantages of using LLVM over GCC, such as better support for specific targets and the availability of various sanitizers. The speaker also mentioned ongoing work in the LLVM community, including data-driven multi-lib support, improving the assembler, and adding features like MCDC code coverage. They encouraged contributions from users and highlighted opportunities for involvement, such as joining the weekly calls and attending developer meetings. The audience asked questions about issues with the GCC linker and how to handle certain scenarios in LLVM. Overall, the talk aimed to provide insight into using LLVM for developing embedded toolchains and encourage collaboration within the LLVM community.
