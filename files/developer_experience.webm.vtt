00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, Faustum, hi.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.720
Wow, it's so good to be here.

00:11.720 --> 00:17.820
You are the heroes of Faustum because I am the closing act and you have come to see me.

00:17.820 --> 00:19.320
This is so good.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.120
Thank you very much for being here.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.120
Six o'clock.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.520
Let's get the show on the road.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.800
I am from the Linux Foundation and I have the privilege of doing research on the open

00:28.800 --> 00:37.480
source ecosystem and I was brought in a couple of years ago to use data as a means to describe

00:37.480 --> 00:45.080
what is taking place across open source communities and to provide greater insight for the purposes

00:45.080 --> 00:48.160
of supporting all kinds of programs in the ecosystem.

00:48.160 --> 00:53.120
If you were here for Abigail's talk previously, a lot of what she had to say was to do with

00:53.120 --> 00:58.640
sustainability and funding projects and I am hopeful that the resource that we are creating

00:58.640 --> 01:04.600
at the Linux Foundation is the utility that will help support grants and funding for otherwise

01:04.600 --> 01:10.840
non-commercial open source projects, especially those that are contributing to sustainability.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.520
So that's the perspective that I come from.

01:13.520 --> 01:18.040
We want to investigate the impact of open source projects through research.

01:18.040 --> 01:24.040
We conduct our research through quantitative and qualitative methodologies, surveys, interviews

01:24.040 --> 01:32.360
and empirical research and we create this resource, co-create it with the community.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.800
We create it by the community and we give it back to the community.

01:35.800 --> 01:40.080
The reports are all published under Creative Commons.

01:40.080 --> 01:44.280
You don't have to give your email and we're not going to spam you for reading them.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.920
So they're a resource for everybody to leverage.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.680
So check us out.

01:49.680 --> 01:54.120
This is our home page if you want to scan and discover the publications that we produce

01:54.120 --> 01:55.120
to date.

01:55.120 --> 01:59.640
We have 26 publications and just shy of two years on a whole variety of topics that I'll

01:59.640 --> 02:01.840
get into.

02:01.840 --> 02:07.120
And the Linux Foundation has a history of doing some important research in open source.

02:07.120 --> 02:13.640
Not that long ago they published the Linux kernel report, Linux kernel history report

02:13.640 --> 02:19.800
as well as the 2020 FOSS contributor survey in collaboration with Harvard's Laboratory

02:19.800 --> 02:26.080
of Innovation Science, which was a deep dive into understanding contributor motivations,

02:26.080 --> 02:27.080
opportunities and challenges.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.640
So if you haven't seen either of those reports, I'd encourage you to check them out.

02:30.640 --> 02:39.160
The 26 reports we've done today are across a number of different frameworks.

02:39.160 --> 02:43.960
It's really tough to package up open source conceptually and do a bunch of research to

02:43.960 --> 02:45.440
say how are we going to organize this.

02:45.440 --> 02:53.080
So we set about, actually before I get down that path, quick example of some recent reports

02:53.080 --> 02:56.920
that you'll find at the top of our website include mentorship and open source, which

02:56.920 --> 03:05.800
also plays into Abigail's speech about sustainability and the role of mentorship programs, enabling

03:05.800 --> 03:10.000
collaboration across open source communities all around the world.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.320
How do we enhance collaboration?

03:11.320 --> 03:15.720
How do we break down silos and how do we reduce fragmentation?

03:15.720 --> 03:20.680
Industry reports like the 2022 state of open source in financial services takes a deep

03:20.680 --> 03:23.080
dive in an industry sector.

03:23.080 --> 03:31.080
And for our friends at the SOTA Foundation, hello Stephen Tan, the 2022 data and storage

03:31.080 --> 03:32.240
trends report.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.920
So just a quick highlight of four recent publications that have come out.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.720
We've got great stuff coming down the pike as well.

03:39.720 --> 03:44.520
Looking at the idea of open source for digital wallets.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.120
Why do we need an open source digital wallet infrastructure?

03:47.120 --> 03:51.040
Well essentially we have centralization in the wallet community right now through Google

03:51.040 --> 03:53.040
Pay and Apple Pay.

03:53.040 --> 03:57.080
We're creating infrastructure through an open source foundation that's going to create

03:57.080 --> 04:05.280
opportunities for any organization to build a secure digital asset infrastructure.

04:05.280 --> 04:12.360
Web 3 and sustainability, looking at some of the challenges around blockchain and how

04:12.360 --> 04:17.520
we can reduce the environmental and carbon impact of blockchain and how blockchains

04:17.520 --> 04:23.960
can reduce our own through providing secure data sets and perhaps incentives, real monetary

04:23.960 --> 04:29.440
tokens for us to change our behavior and start making sustainable choices and be rewarded

04:29.440 --> 04:36.360
for them, be rewarded for buying the carbon neutral product and use the token to ride

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
public transit.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.320
But you can't use the token to put gas in your car.

04:40.320 --> 04:45.120
That's an example of the economies that are coming down the road.

04:45.120 --> 04:50.400
And our deliverables, everything we do is available under Creative Commons.

04:50.400 --> 04:56.240
We publish our data sets, our survey data that is free of personally identifiable information.

04:56.240 --> 05:03.640
And we do so on data.world, data repository essentially, not unlike GitHub, but a little

05:03.640 --> 05:09.880
bit more accessible for the non-coder to be able to find our data sets.

05:09.880 --> 05:14.400
And if you want to play around with our data and create your own analysis, go to data.world,

05:14.400 --> 05:20.080
check out the Linux Foundation data sets and feel free to explore some of our survey data.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
And see what you come up with.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.240
Let us know if you find something different.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.320
We'd love to hear from you.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.960
We produce reports, infographics and so on.

05:27.960 --> 05:33.920
So check out these resources and if there's a way that you can use them to support your

05:33.920 --> 05:38.600
project communities, go for it and let us know how you make out.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.640
So the first way we conduct research is on geographic lines.

05:42.640 --> 05:47.160
We think that there's some unique trends taking place in different regions around the world.

05:47.160 --> 05:52.440
And what's happening in Europe that might be different from North America?

05:52.440 --> 05:53.440
Is there a different culture?

05:53.440 --> 05:56.560
Are there different opportunities?

05:56.560 --> 05:57.560
And what's going on?

05:57.560 --> 06:00.280
The first report we published was last year, our Europe Spotlight.

06:00.280 --> 06:06.440
So if you're interested in how European open source communities are taking advantage of

06:06.440 --> 06:11.160
the open source opportunity or not, give this report a read.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.640
It's got some pretty interesting insights.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.720
Second way we go about conducting research is along an industry analysis.

06:16.720 --> 06:21.480
So if your project is specific to a certain industry, whether it's maybe it's film and

06:21.480 --> 06:28.480
entertainment, maybe it's financial services, maybe it's energy, our research is very focused

06:28.480 --> 06:31.720
sometimes on industry specific open source projects.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.200
The energy example is really exciting.

06:34.200 --> 06:40.520
And the more that regulators know about open source projects in an energy vertical, the

06:40.520 --> 06:45.480
better because we need to transition off of older infrastructure and open source is the

06:45.480 --> 06:48.000
path to doing that.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.600
One example of an industry project is in the motion pictures industry with the Academy

06:52.600 --> 06:54.880
Software Foundation.

06:54.880 --> 07:02.760
Many of the projects that were used to create the Academy nine time nominated film, Dune,

07:02.760 --> 07:05.120
was built with open source software.

07:05.120 --> 07:09.320
And we host nine projects at the Academy Software Foundation.

07:09.320 --> 07:14.240
And this research report tells the story of how it was formed and what needs to happen

07:14.240 --> 07:19.520
in that community to keep it sustainable where the challenges are.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.720
Technology horizontal is another way we approach our research.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.440
Recent example being resiliency in cloud.

07:25.440 --> 07:30.280
How do we achieve multi-cloud resiliency?

07:30.280 --> 07:34.680
We did this with Cloud Native Computing Foundation and it was a result of a round table we hosted

07:34.680 --> 07:37.520
at KubeCon in Valencia.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.280
And finally, and this is where the developer community comes into play, you'll see at the

07:41.280 --> 07:51.400
top of this graphic is the developer contributor framework to view open source opportunities.

07:51.400 --> 07:56.720
What are the issues specific to developers, to maintainers, to sustainability, to diversity

07:56.720 --> 08:03.120
equity inclusion, leadership, racial and social justice, and so on.

08:03.120 --> 08:08.040
So we've got a lot of reports that don't fall neatly into a tech horizontal or an industry

08:08.040 --> 08:15.400
vertical or a geographic framework, but they apply the whole ecosystem.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.040
Recent example, DEI.

08:17.040 --> 08:23.680
I happened to co-author this one with a woman named Jessica Groupman and it really talks

08:23.680 --> 08:28.720
about the good, the bad, and the ugly about diversity issues across open source project

08:28.720 --> 08:34.360
communities and how we can collectively work together to address some of the challenges.

08:34.360 --> 08:38.880
But importantly, we've got more and more work coming that is focused on the developer

08:38.880 --> 08:40.760
and maintainer experience.

08:40.760 --> 08:48.520
And it is very, very important that we continue to explore the issues so that we can provide

08:48.520 --> 08:53.640
better programming and resourcing to support our developer community.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.360
How do we ensure sustainable projects?

08:55.360 --> 08:57.600
How do we ensure diverse projects?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.760
How do we ensure funding?

08:59.760 --> 09:04.120
How do we incentivize developers to implement security best practices?

09:04.120 --> 09:08.920
And we find the answers to these questions through research.

09:08.920 --> 09:15.400
And today I'm going to share some of the insights that have come across the 26 projects that

09:15.400 --> 09:21.240
we've done to date in all different ways that have some story to tell about the developer

09:21.240 --> 09:22.240
experience.

09:22.240 --> 09:27.840
So this is what this collection of next slides is all about.

09:27.840 --> 09:32.720
Davos are having a really good time doing what they're doing.

09:32.720 --> 09:37.200
Many projects that we've done have said that open source development is fun.

09:37.200 --> 09:43.400
And like time and time and time again, this is almost a universal truth that people are

09:43.400 --> 09:48.960
here because they find it a stimulating and rewarding place to be.

09:48.960 --> 09:49.960
And that's kind of exciting.

09:49.960 --> 09:57.000
It's really, it's great and it's probably why open source projects are so prolific.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.480
People enjoy contributing code.

10:00.480 --> 10:05.680
Out of our Europe study, fun really is a leading motivation here.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.280
Much more so than, say, career development.

10:09.280 --> 10:16.200
We concluded that, and also through interviews, that there's sort of a romantic thing going

10:16.200 --> 10:20.040
on in Europe that is less prevalent in other geographic regions.

10:20.040 --> 10:28.680
And it really is around doing good, creating solutions that have a purpose.

10:28.680 --> 10:36.600
And there's a strong motivation for learning and fun in this community.

10:36.600 --> 10:43.120
Open source is also an incredibly empowering space for our respondents, the majority of

10:43.120 --> 10:50.800
whom are developers, that the opportunity to create infrastructure, to create projects

10:50.800 --> 11:00.600
that have intrinsic value for a region that allow for sovereignty, that allow us to not

11:00.600 --> 11:04.640
be reliant on certain vendors.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.680
And this is a really motivating factor.

11:07.680 --> 11:14.200
And this being in this space is an incredibly empowering and rewarding activity.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.920
We have an opportunity to change the world if we don't like it.

11:18.920 --> 11:24.040
What's fascinating is the extent to which developers are taking a personal interest

11:24.040 --> 11:25.040
in their work.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.240
They show up because they care.

11:27.240 --> 11:33.200
And really, without that personal attachment and intrinsic motivation, we just wouldn't

11:33.200 --> 11:37.400
be where we are, especially when we consider how many projects do not have funding.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.800
And they are not part of a commercial ecosystem.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.200
So this motivation keeps these projects going.

11:44.200 --> 11:50.160
It also, if there's a, the other side of this coin is that if there's a loss of motivation

11:50.160 --> 11:56.440
of some kind, if there's the feeling of sudden apathy, then a project can just be shelved

11:56.440 --> 11:59.160
and somebody can sign off and say, I'm out.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.760
So that is a risk that we face.

12:00.760 --> 12:06.720
And we've seen examples of that recently, though I couldn't name the specific project.

12:06.720 --> 12:11.720
You hear about people having a change of heart.

12:11.720 --> 12:16.680
Training is also something that's incredibly important as new technologies are emerging,

12:16.680 --> 12:23.000
as security is becoming increasingly important.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.720
Organizations are looking for highly skilled, highly trained open source software developers.

12:28.720 --> 12:35.160
And the skills that they're looking for now have eclipsed Linux as a focus point.

12:35.160 --> 12:41.840
Skills are sought after in cloud, in DevOps, in security, and yes, very much so in Linux.

12:41.840 --> 12:50.680
But we're also seeing new projects emerging in Metaverse, in AI, PyTorch being an example.

12:50.680 --> 12:54.760
So training is very much in demand.

12:54.760 --> 13:00.400
And fortunately, there are good resources available that are often free.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.640
We host many of them at the Linux Foundation, so check them out.

13:03.640 --> 13:08.280
The other bit of good news is that employers, if you're fortunate enough to be in a situation

13:08.280 --> 13:13.520
where you're paid to contribute, companies are paying for training.

13:13.520 --> 13:19.520
And 90% of hiring managers will say, we'll hire you, come here, and we will pay to skill

13:19.520 --> 13:21.320
you up.

13:21.320 --> 13:29.080
And the reason being, not only the hiring managers, but within organizations, we can't

13:29.080 --> 13:33.040
necessarily hire our way out of digital challenges.

13:33.040 --> 13:38.880
We have to sometimes work with the talent pools that we have and train our team members.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.760
Because it's incredibly costly to go out and pay a developer who you think has the right

13:42.760 --> 13:46.280
skills only for them to leave and go to a competitor.

13:46.280 --> 13:54.880
So training a resource in-house seems to be a trend that we're seeing specific to DevOps.

13:54.880 --> 13:59.840
And fortunately, everyone in this room is in a really good position because the demand

13:59.840 --> 14:07.640
for your skills exceeds the supply of skilled people available to provide.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.640
The service.

14:08.640 --> 14:14.680
You're in a very, very good space right now, as industries are becoming increasingly software

14:14.680 --> 14:17.840
defined, you are calling all the shots.

14:17.840 --> 14:22.760
So leverage it to your advantage.

14:22.760 --> 14:26.240
Sometimes there are barriers that prevent you from doing the things that you really want

14:26.240 --> 14:27.240
to do.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.240
I'll give you an example.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.720
You have an industry full-time, you have a paid job, it's in a highly regulated industry

14:32.720 --> 14:39.720
like financial services, and the company policy says that, sorry, not only can you not contribute

14:39.720 --> 14:48.840
to projects on behalf of the organization and open source that might be beneficial, but

14:48.840 --> 14:53.880
you also can't contribute to projects in your personal time.

14:53.880 --> 14:58.800
And that's a barrier that industry needs to figure out how to solve because it is ultimately

14:58.800 --> 15:00.880
to their detriment.

15:00.880 --> 15:05.600
And the regulatory community, particularly in certain verticals, has to come to terms

15:05.600 --> 15:11.160
with the realities of the way open source is developed and not put up so many barriers

15:11.160 --> 15:14.440
that are non-threatening.

15:14.440 --> 15:20.360
I'm thinking of community chat rooms on a repo within financial services and the SEC

15:20.360 --> 15:28.320
freaking out in case regulatory policies were being breached in any kind of activity.

15:28.320 --> 15:36.600
The other barriers are for certain types of industries are around access to Slack or access

15:36.600 --> 15:42.960
even SurveyMonkey, we do surveys, really challenging to try to get data through some corporate firewalls.

15:42.960 --> 15:48.480
So there are like non-tariff barriers.

15:48.480 --> 15:53.000
Really very, very important and there are lots of tools out there that can help developers

15:53.000 --> 15:59.720
better understand dependencies and the number one benefit, it's the number one benefit of

15:59.720 --> 16:09.800
producing S-POMs, better understanding the dependencies in your projects.

16:09.800 --> 16:16.560
Here is a truth and I think, I don't know if anyone here would disagree, but DOVs are

16:16.560 --> 16:19.480
pretty amazing project ambassadors.

16:19.480 --> 16:25.520
Carol Payne from Netflix speaks publicly and often about the projects she contributes

16:25.520 --> 16:34.440
to and inspires other people to get involved, helps recruiting new developers to projects

16:34.440 --> 16:41.680
and she feels that she has a responsibility to do that and we see so many DOVs advocating

16:41.680 --> 16:48.720
because it's the right thing to do and it's incredible to building a community.

16:48.720 --> 16:53.640
For all of those of you who are ambassadors for your project, keep up the good work.

16:53.640 --> 16:59.920
Makes such a difference and it's so nice to see people being the champion of one project

16:59.920 --> 17:02.960
or another.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.720
Open source development in particular has its benefits.

17:05.720 --> 17:14.960
I recently gave a talk to an organization that had a lot of people were just working

17:14.960 --> 17:19.480
in a closed source environment and they're not necessarily aware of what the benefit

17:19.480 --> 17:25.640
is to working in open source and of course everyone here knows that you have the opportunity

17:25.640 --> 17:29.560
to learn from others and build on the work of others, you don't actually have to go

17:29.560 --> 17:37.720
it alone, there's so much less pressure and less stress and tremendous upside but these

17:37.720 --> 17:42.280
truths are not necessarily widely known so that's what I have to do is say look these

17:42.280 --> 17:47.480
are great places, great spaces, there's a lot of benefit, open source is a good thing.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.400
Take advantage of the opportunities.

17:49.400 --> 17:54.600
I am a different kind of ambassador telling this story about why open source actually

17:54.600 --> 17:58.840
works and what the value proposition is.

17:58.840 --> 18:06.400
And devs mitigate risk by this very openness, by accepting external viewpoints.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.960
One of the things that I had to come to terms with when I started working for the Linux

18:09.960 --> 18:16.760
Foundation is the open sourcing of the research development process.

18:16.760 --> 18:23.200
Having so many eyes on a research paper before it gets published, that was like a shock to

18:23.200 --> 18:25.080
me.

18:25.080 --> 18:30.000
And because of the culture I am in at the Linux Foundation, I work with incredibly smart

18:30.000 --> 18:34.720
people and a whole bunch of different disciplines.

18:34.720 --> 18:41.760
They are all weighing in on my report and I'll tell you something, I've never had such

18:41.760 --> 18:47.400
high quality research as a consequence because people genuinely care, it's not necessarily

18:47.400 --> 18:53.000
in their job description but they are weighing in on the document because A, they can and

18:53.000 --> 18:56.960
so they do and they genuinely want to make something better.

18:56.960 --> 19:02.560
So my experience is that this methodology really, really works to create high quality

19:02.560 --> 19:06.560
outcomes, definitely onto something here.

19:06.560 --> 19:12.120
And yes devs can further mitigate risk by taking personal responsibility of implementing security

19:12.120 --> 19:19.640
best practices including the increasing use of multi-factor authentication tokens to increase

19:19.640 --> 19:23.560
greater account security.

19:23.560 --> 19:29.480
So we're spreading the word about how we can improve the security of software supply chains,

19:29.480 --> 19:35.840
what are the tools available, what resources do you need and we're really just getting

19:35.840 --> 19:37.960
started here.

19:37.960 --> 19:46.400
This particular factoid came from the report we published this year with the laboratory

19:46.400 --> 19:56.080
of innovation science from Harvard which was census two looking at essentially three software

19:56.080 --> 20:05.200
composition analysis from sneak, FOSSA and synopsis ran scans to identify the most commonly

20:05.200 --> 20:10.400
used application libraries so that we could have a measure, it's not a perfect measure

20:10.400 --> 20:14.040
but it is a measure of the most popular software.

20:14.040 --> 20:20.640
So if we know what the most widely used applications are we can prioritize our efforts to secure

20:20.640 --> 20:22.120
them.

20:22.120 --> 20:26.000
That's the rationale behind some of the research we're doing and that's where this particular

20:26.000 --> 20:31.080
point came from.

20:31.080 --> 20:35.960
And yes you shoulder a lot of responsibility.

20:35.960 --> 20:43.680
The FOSSA census two validated again that the most widely used free and open source software

20:43.680 --> 20:48.720
is developed by only a handful of contributors.

20:48.720 --> 20:56.280
In one dataset 136 were responsible for more than 80% of the lines of code added to the

20:56.280 --> 21:00.680
top 50 packages.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.440
So how do we share that responsibility?

21:02.440 --> 21:05.280
I don't know but we're working on it.

21:05.280 --> 21:09.320
If you have ideas that's what we're here for.

21:09.320 --> 21:19.840
I want everybody here to take away the opportunity that research through the LF is a mechanism

21:19.840 --> 21:23.600
for you to be heard.

21:23.600 --> 21:30.000
If a stat seems wrong or if you have an opinion let's hear your opinion.

21:30.000 --> 21:38.840
We would love nothing more than to hear from you so as to change programming and resourcing

21:38.840 --> 21:41.600
that will better support you.

21:41.600 --> 21:48.440
So let this be your mechanism to share your perspectives and knowledge.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.400
Toxicity and open source is real.

21:51.400 --> 21:58.280
It came through our, it was real before we did research on it but one in five open source

21:58.280 --> 22:04.400
devs have been discriminated or felt unwelcome or professionals I should say.

22:04.400 --> 22:13.320
And it is minority groups that are most acutely affected.

22:13.320 --> 22:20.040
The minority populations of our community really struggle in not feeling welcome in

22:20.040 --> 22:22.160
open source.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.640
And why is this such an issue?

22:23.640 --> 22:28.440
Well, it's really important because diverse technologies are better technologies.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.240
Diversity creates better tech.

22:30.240 --> 22:34.440
For the longest time I'm from Canada by the way and we have a thing called postal codes

22:34.440 --> 22:40.840
which differ from zip codes and they differ from European postal codes as well.

22:40.840 --> 22:49.160
But because we're so often filling out forms specific to the United States I'd like those

22:49.160 --> 22:54.760
forms to have an extra space where I can put my postal code in because that's just a technology

22:54.760 --> 22:55.760
frustration.

22:55.760 --> 23:02.480
But the designer of a form realized that they need more than zip codes for inclusion like

23:02.480 --> 23:04.720
let's include the Canadians.

23:04.720 --> 23:05.720
That's great.

23:05.720 --> 23:11.560
That's how you get better technology you think outside your lane and you increase opportunities

23:11.560 --> 23:14.880
for others to participate.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.480
And Rachel Rose from ILM.

23:16.480 --> 23:23.440
ILM is the Lucasfilm production unit.

23:23.440 --> 23:29.280
So industrial light and magic, making all the Star Wars stuff and making some pretty

23:29.280 --> 23:34.760
good films with open source software.

23:34.760 --> 23:39.120
And nobody says it better when we have people with varied backgrounds and opinions we get

23:39.120 --> 23:40.120
better software.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.320
Thank you, Rachel.

23:42.320 --> 23:48.480
We've got upcoming research that's very specific to maintainers because of the responsibility

23:48.480 --> 23:51.600
that is shouldered on maintainers.

23:51.600 --> 24:01.040
And what we did before I jump into this particular point, after we published the second census

24:01.040 --> 24:04.960
report, census two that was scanning those application libraries to identify the most

24:04.960 --> 24:11.880
popular software, we tried to reach as many of those maintainers we could to have a conversation

24:11.880 --> 24:14.040
with them and say what is going on?

24:14.040 --> 24:15.040
What do you need?

24:15.040 --> 24:16.040
What are your challenges?

24:16.040 --> 24:17.040
What are your constraints?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.040
How's it going?

24:18.040 --> 24:20.440
Do you have a successor?

24:20.440 --> 24:22.160
What was your pathway to hear?

24:22.160 --> 24:23.560
Are you paid?

24:23.560 --> 24:25.520
How much time is on your hands?

24:25.520 --> 24:31.120
And it is this methodology that is producing the next couple of slides.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.000
This report is still in development.

24:33.000 --> 24:40.040
We've got a really solid draft, but we will be publishing these insights at some point

24:40.040 --> 24:41.680
in the quarter.

24:41.680 --> 24:48.160
So really excited to get a window into the world of the maintainers of some of the most

24:48.160 --> 24:50.760
critical software in the world.

24:50.760 --> 24:58.960
And great quote that, you know, maintenance can fill an infinite amount of time if you

24:58.960 --> 25:00.640
let it.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.640
And that's true.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.680
Sometimes I feel that way about the Linux rotation.

25:03.680 --> 25:07.200
The more I give to Linux rotation, the more it takes from me.

25:07.200 --> 25:12.720
But it's a gift that, you know, you give and you get so much back in return.

25:12.720 --> 25:18.280
I think this is true for maintainers that they're just giving, giving, giving.

25:18.280 --> 25:22.880
And that repo is always going to take it.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.880
Maintainers need tools.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.800
They need hacks.

25:26.800 --> 25:34.120
They need productivity tools that are going to improve their workflows.

25:34.120 --> 25:43.600
Forty-four percent of developers want their employers to provide these artifacts, sandboxes

25:43.600 --> 25:48.640
and resources and things that help them do their jobs better.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.200
And money, though, is incredibly important.

25:51.200 --> 25:57.280
And Abigail's talk emphasized the need for funding people have to eat.

25:57.280 --> 26:02.200
It is not the primary motivator for people to work on open-source software projects.

26:02.200 --> 26:10.000
So it's not, maintainer constraints and challenges is not something that money necessarily solves.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.480
Money can't buy me more hours in my day, and it can't buy me sustainable legacy for my work.

26:17.480 --> 26:23.080
We need to approach things differently outside of financial terms alone.

26:23.080 --> 26:30.480
It is part of the equation, but it's not the motivating factor.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.520
And yeah, maintainership is very often a job.

26:33.520 --> 26:40.400
It is not a hobby, and the pressure for maintainers is to build features and not fix bugs.

26:40.400 --> 26:45.800
That's an equation that we need to change and figure out how we do it when we have a community

26:45.800 --> 26:50.160
that is so constrained in terms of time.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.040
How do we motivate intrinsically?

26:53.040 --> 26:54.640
What tools do we need to provide?

26:54.640 --> 27:03.240
So we're hoping to answer more of these types of questions as we continue to do more research.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.320
So yes, please get involved.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.920
Get involved.

27:06.920 --> 27:11.280
Research is just a different kind of open-source contribution.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.280
We issue badges.

27:12.280 --> 27:18.440
If you contribute to a research project, either by way of writing a forward or doing a peer

27:18.440 --> 27:24.040
review of a survey before it's published, maybe you're going to localize the survey to

27:24.040 --> 27:27.680
Japanese or Chinese or German or French.

27:27.680 --> 27:35.000
We've got an opportunity for you to get involved in this output.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.600
And there's nothing I love more than when Phil Hollerin from GitHub shares his credley

27:40.600 --> 27:45.800
badge on LinkedIn and says, it was great to be a contributor to research.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.880
It was really, really rewarding.

27:47.880 --> 27:51.120
And it was as rewarding for me to work with Phil.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.360
I have enjoyed this experience immensely.

27:53.360 --> 27:59.280
I've learned so much in my two years of doing research for the LF.

27:59.280 --> 28:07.720
And working with people all across the ecosystem, from industry to community organizations.

28:07.720 --> 28:12.880
I come from the blockchain space, I did blockchain research previously, but I really do love

28:12.880 --> 28:14.440
the open-source community.

28:14.440 --> 28:17.040
It's a great place.

28:17.040 --> 28:21.880
I would love nothing more for you all to sign up and receive our newsletter and to learn

28:21.880 --> 28:26.120
about opportunities to get more involved, to take surveys.

28:26.120 --> 28:31.920
This year we're going to launch a panel and hope to get as many people on that panel as

28:31.920 --> 28:35.120
possible so as to create better insight.

28:35.120 --> 28:40.560
And to be given the opportunity to answer surveys and tell us what's going on, tell

28:40.560 --> 28:42.800
us how to fix it.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.840
So please stay in touch with us.

28:44.840 --> 28:49.520
We're going to have more news on the development of our survey panel this year.

28:49.520 --> 28:53.000
It's my mandate to create it.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.080
And I'd love nothing more than for you to be a part of it.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.720
And with that, thank you very much.

28:59.720 --> 29:04.480
I'll be very happy to try to answer your questions.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.480
Thank you.

29:05.480 --> 29:06.480
Thank you, Larry.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.480
We have questions?

29:07.480 --> 29:08.480
Questions?

29:08.480 --> 29:09.480
Questions?

29:09.480 --> 29:26.560
Sure, yes, I will move to the slide this one.

29:26.560 --> 29:37.640
Thank you.

29:37.640 --> 29:43.240
You showed us some statistics there which I found really interesting.

29:43.240 --> 29:47.320
What's the most surprising thing that's come out of research that you've done or worked

29:47.320 --> 29:49.400
on with Linux Foundation?

29:49.400 --> 29:52.640
Wow, that is a great question.

29:52.640 --> 30:01.520
What is the most surprising thing that I've learned through research?

30:01.520 --> 30:03.280
I am surprised every single day.

30:03.280 --> 30:09.520
Honestly, I learn so much every day I'm humbled by the amount that I learn.

30:09.520 --> 30:21.440
I think what's fascinating is the community aspect of open source and that this is a community

30:21.440 --> 30:28.800
by people that without community we would not have this technology infrastructure.

30:28.800 --> 30:34.160
I think that's the most fascinating and inspiring thing that I have learned.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.000
It's really wonderful.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
So, yeah.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Thanks.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.640
Thank you for your question.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.640
More questions?

30:42.640 --> 30:46.040
There's one over here.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.040
Over here.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.040
Sorry.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.040
There you go.

30:49.040 --> 31:00.720
Well, thanks for the presentation.

31:00.720 --> 31:05.040
I'm curious whether do you have any data on how much of the research that we have in the

31:05.040 --> 31:09.920
software industry that go to open source software versus closed source software, proprietary

31:09.920 --> 31:10.920
software.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.200
Do you have any data on that?

31:12.200 --> 31:15.800
No, we have not done any research of that nature, I'm afraid.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.760
It's an excellent question.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.360
There are so many questions to answer.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.200
That's an excellent question.

31:22.200 --> 31:28.120
Another question that we get a lot and still have not found a good way to answer is what

31:28.120 --> 31:33.400
is the consumption of open source software or the usage?

31:33.400 --> 31:37.000
We know that there are a lot of downloads, but we don't necessarily have a good way of

31:37.000 --> 31:38.600
measuring usage.

31:38.600 --> 31:39.600
Very challenging to track.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.520
It's a challenging space to research.

31:41.520 --> 31:53.680
But good question.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.680
Thank you.

31:54.680 --> 31:59.440
You had a slide on diversity, a quote.

31:59.440 --> 32:04.680
My personal observations on developers is that there's not so many women amongst them.

32:04.680 --> 32:10.360
Is it also a topic of the Linux Foundation to look into that, or has some research being

32:10.360 --> 32:17.400
done to find the reason why that is, and how to overcome them at some point?

32:17.400 --> 32:21.800
Why are there so few women in open source is part of... I'm going to go back to that

32:21.800 --> 32:28.720
slide so that you can see... You can download the report, actually, here it is.

32:28.720 --> 32:35.600
In this report, we do offer some insight as to how we can help overcome the fact that

32:35.600 --> 32:43.320
we have diversity challenges and why we struggle to recruit women.

32:43.320 --> 32:50.000
I've come to learn through my exploration of COBOL as a programming language, a little

32:50.000 --> 32:59.560
bit of the history about programming languages and computer science becoming more high value

32:59.560 --> 33:07.320
work and engineering becoming more high value work, and societally, it actually migrated

33:07.320 --> 33:13.760
from women programmers to men in the 60s.

33:13.760 --> 33:20.720
The first programmers, the film Hidden Figures, women using FORTRAN, it was not necessarily

33:20.720 --> 33:22.600
a high skilled activity.

33:22.600 --> 33:28.520
In fact, COBOL is an incredibly teachable skill, and there's an amazing opportunity to

33:28.520 --> 33:34.160
skill up anybody who wants to learn how to code, they generally can.

33:34.160 --> 33:42.920
Over time, computer engineering became deemed to be high value work and became the work

33:42.920 --> 33:49.240
of men exclusively, and the technology industry broadly, this is a function of tech in general,

33:49.240 --> 33:52.240
the maths, the sciences, the humanities.

33:52.240 --> 33:59.680
I don't think that we've done our daughters a great service in socializing them into the

33:59.680 --> 34:00.680
sciences.

34:00.680 --> 34:06.480
I was not socialized into tech, but I see that LEGO, one of the best toys I ever played

34:06.480 --> 34:15.600
with as a child, has been marketed not as a gender neutral toy anymore.

34:15.600 --> 34:21.800
There's LEGO friends in the pink boxes, and there's the helicopters and the other stuff,

34:21.800 --> 34:26.000
and that's marketed in the boys section, and I think that's unfortunate, because the type

34:26.000 --> 34:31.280
of LEGO products that are marketed for girls are around, it's a house, or it's a bakery,

34:31.280 --> 34:37.120
or it's a beauty shop, so if I play with LEGO, I'm playing with the beauty shop, and the

34:37.120 --> 34:44.760
shopping mall, but if I buy the other color of LEGO, I'm building the Death Star, the

34:44.760 --> 34:50.160
Star Wars station, or the helicopter, that's really a problem, so I think we have generational

34:50.160 --> 34:57.280
change to make, the way we socialize girls, and the way we socialize boys to do nontraditional

34:57.280 --> 35:03.680
activities as well, and we're in a real non-binary kind of world, so we have to think about how

35:03.680 --> 35:10.280
we socialize for the next generation.

35:10.280 --> 35:20.360
Any more questions?

35:20.360 --> 35:22.880
It's drink time!

35:22.880 --> 35:23.880
Thank you everybody.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.920
Were there any more questions?

35:25.920 --> 35:28.040
I didn't think so.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.040
This is awesome.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.840
Thank you so much for coming at the very end of the day.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.840
You're great.

35:32.840 --> 35:39.840
Thank you so much.
