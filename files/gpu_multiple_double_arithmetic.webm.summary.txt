The talk discusses multiple double arithmetic on GPUs, which allows for increased precision in computations. This approach has been around since the late 1960s, and the speaker uses the GQD library and Compari software to perform calculations in quad and octo double precision. The talk covers various applications of this method, including evaluating polynomials and solving polynomial systems using Newton's method, and highlights the importance of tailoring kernels for different precision levels. All software used is free and open source.
