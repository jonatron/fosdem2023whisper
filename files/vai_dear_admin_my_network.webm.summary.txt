The talk discusses how to identify networks inside a guest in virtual machines, particularly using the Kubernetes add-on called Kuvert. The problem with the classic way of running virtual machines is that it only has one network called ETH0, and it can change randomly after reboots. The speaker suggests several ways to address this issue, such as using predictable naming schemes based on ACPI indexes or PCI addresses, defining tags on interfaces, and modifying guest images to enable predictable naming. The talk also mentions the possibility of using different identifiers for non-Linux systems.
