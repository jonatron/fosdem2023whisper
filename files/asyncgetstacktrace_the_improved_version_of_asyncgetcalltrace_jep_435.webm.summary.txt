In this talk, Johannes Pechberger discussed their new project, Async Get Stack Trace, an improved version of the Async Get Call Trace API that provides more information and is more robustly supported. It gives more information on threads in both Java and native modes and offers options to walk on both Java and non-Java stacks. As they are still in the process of testing, this project is not yet available in the OpenTraderK distribution.
