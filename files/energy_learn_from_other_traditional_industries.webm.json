{"text": " All right, so we're here for the energy foster panel, and I will first introduce myself, Ferdi Bonci. I'm a professor for monitoring and distributed control for power systems. I'm with the Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems at WTH Aachen in Germany. So I work on solutions, microservice based architectures for measuring, monitoring, controlling this energy grid undergoing the transition, so packed with renewables, with new types of users, with all kinds of energy storage systems. I have collaborated with the Linux Foundation Energy to prepare the survey, the 2022 survey on transformation readiness for the electrical system. And we were targeting utilities to find out how ready they are for the digital transition. Just want to mention that this effort was initiated, was driven by Dr. Shuli Goodman with whom I had the privilege to work, and the joy to know, and that will be my forever role model. Okay, so I'm looking forward to hear the experiences from other industries as we're concerned with the digital transition. So I would like our panelists to first introduce themselves. So please, Kate Stewart, if you want to start. My name is Kate Stewart, I'm the VP of Dependable Embedded Systems at the Linux Foundation. And so my focus has been what do we need to do to make open source projects and systems dependable in the embedded system, and obviously, given the energy sector and given the critical nature of it, this is something that's very near and dear to the things I care about. Thank you, Kate, great. So we'll go in first name alphabetical order now, Daniel. Yes, hi, I'm Dan Koshy, I'm the executive director responsible for automotive grade Linux. And before that, I was the VP GM of the automotive business unit at a company called Montevista, and we were the first to put Linux in a car, that was my division, and we were also the first to put Linux in a mobile phone, which was the Motorola Razr mobile phone. So that's kind of my background. Thank you, Dan. Thanks a lot. Gabrielle, please. Well, first of all, thank you for the opportunity here. I'm Gabrielle Columbro. I have two roles. One is a general manager for Linux Foundation Europe. This is one of the areas that makes it really interesting for me to be here. So thank you for the opportunity. The role why I'm here is executive director of FINOS, the FinTech Open Source Foundation. We really spent the last few years waking up the financial services industry to the benefits of open source, and we are now seeing a lot of potential for this industry to better collaborate in the open. So I'm happy to share my experience here. Wonderful. Thank you. And Rani, please. Yeah, hi. Hi, I'm Rani Haibi. I'm the CTO of Networking Edge and Access at the Linux Foundation, where I work with the telecommunication industry stakeholders on building the technology required for not just the digitization of that industry, but as you know, the telecommunication industry has to almost reinvent itself every 10 years or so with the different generations of communication, the 4G, 5G, we're already looking at 6G, and open source plays a large role in accelerating this innovation, and I'm sure there are many similarities between the telecommunication industry, which is heavily regulated, and the energy industry, which can be used to learn and figure out how to do things right. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. It already sounds promising and great, good. So I guess we can get started, and I guess we can all agree that the energy sector is really at the tipping point, and that it requires a transformation for decarbonizing the energy system, and to meet the carbonization goals, the digital transition is a necessary step. So each of you works in an industry that has undergone a similar transformation before. So based on your experience in your own industry, what should the energy stakeholders keep in mind to make this transition as efficient as possible? Would you want to start, maybe you, Kate? So I think one of the things that's important to keep in mind here, as people are trying to transition, is these sorts of journeys go better with company, and so finding people that you can collaborate with, and effectively forming communities, will help build up more consensus, get more eyes on the problem, and will accelerate the quality coming into play. So I think that is sort of the one probable tip that they should sort of look at. We're seeing lots and lots and lots of innovation happening in the embedded space right now, between the wind, the solar, and so forth, and a lot of microgrids and some of the new grid technologies emerging that are using the open source technologies. So figuring out, finding projects that you're interested in, that are the relevant to you, and then starting to collaborate to extend it to make sure it fits for your use case, it's pretty much why open source tends to work. Thank you so much. Anybody who wants to follow up, maybe Dan? Yeah, I'll say a few words. So my advice to the energy sector would be to identify, like a handful, maybe three to five companies that are key leaders or thought leaders in this space at the moment. And really get them to buy into this digitization and new open source model. And I'll use automotive grade Linux, which we also refer to as AGL as an example. So we identified the top car makers like Toyota, Mazda, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, et cetera. And we got them involved very, very early. And by doing so, it caused the entire supply chain underneath them to pay attention, but also it caused them to say, hey, we need to get behind this because our biggest clients are behind it. Right? If Toyota is behind this effort, we need to get behind this effort. And together, they form this community, which now we have over 150 companies. And that would be my advice to the energy sectors. You need at least the top dogs, you know, the top three to five companies, or at least the thought leaders, the ones that are innovative to buy into what you're trying to do and really change the way the supply chain and the community will be working in the future. That would be my advice. Thank you so much. Very, very direct. Gabriele, do you want to say something? Yeah, absolutely. And I certainly want to echo what Kate then shared, you know, it is not lost on me that especially when you're talking about, you know, a regulated industry like finance or, you know, energy, of course, we hear from Telco, you know, it is really hard to change an industry through open source if you don't have, you know, both a broad community but also a community that really has the sort of market leaders and the players, you know, it's not lost on me that Finos wouldn't have experienced this growth if we didn't have sort of the top 10 investment banks in the world, really already part of the community from the gap go. If I can add something specific to the nature of the industry, you know, I come from open source communities, I'm a developer, I've always sort of been very fond of the value of open source, you know, in technology, in terms of talent, in terms of collaboration, in terms of the solutions that it can provide. But when you're trying to build a community that is vertical and vertically focused on a specific industry, it's really important to hone in on the business value that can be driven out of open source, not just the technology value. And that's something that, you know, in my world has meant finding use cases and strategic challenges that are important for these sort of large firms, but not just for those, you know, to really involve every constituent in the value chain of that specific industry. In our case means, you know, not only the banks, but of course, fintechs, vendors, data and technology vendor of the work in their industry, and importantly, regulators. And know that there is a sometimes an impedance mismatch in terms of their understanding of open source and sometimes the fear of open source, but in the long term is super valuable if you can shift left that engagement to the point that, you know, maybe before my grandkids grow old, they come up with open source machine readable regulation themselves. And so that that's a little bit of a, you know, a call to involve all the different constituents, of course, with, you know, having sort of the top leaders involved. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Very interesting. Yeah. So I think something that I heard in the telecommunication industry that kind of slowed down the adoption of open source was the misconception that the industry is so unique with its requirement for high availability and being regulated that we need to invent everything from scratch and all the technology needs to be unique. While in reality, there's some grain of truth to that, but there are some unique requirements. But if you really look at the required technology, I would say 90% of it can be reused from other industry, maybe the cloud service providers, maybe even from enterprise. And maybe by using that, only 10% of the software needs to be unique per industry, but there's a lot that can be reused. So there's no need to kind of reinvent the wheel. There's a lot that can be adopted. You're so true. Thank you. All right. So now that we had this round of tips from the different industries, maybe we want to go deeper into what is the role of open source specifically in your industry. So how did open source impact digital transformation within your industry so that we can make the case for the energy sector as well? Yeah, I can see a few words. So in the case of automotive, it was quite challenging because it wasn't necessarily a technology discussion. It was a discussion with lawyers because the automotive industry is very much risk averse. So everything they do is to mitigate risk and liability. And the misconception was that open source was not secure and not safe and that it was a bunch of hackers doing stuff on some website. And all these misconceptions, we had to go to these automotive companies and teach them that this is not the case. And we used a lot of methods to do this. One of the methods is that the Linux Foundation has some very good reports that show that open source is actually more secure. There's more eyeballs. There's more developers looking at the source code to make sure that it doesn't have any nefarious intentions or nefarious code. And unlike closed source where one bad employee could really inject some bad code and if that employee leaves someday, a lot of bad things can happen. And so all these misconceptions, we had to educate the industry. We had to educate specifically the legal departments inside these car companies to make them understand that, no, this is really, really good high quality software. In fact, this open source software runs most of the internet as we know it. And so once they started understanding that and we started explaining to them that it's actually potentially less liability for you because I'll use the Toyota example. If Toyota is using a piece of open source software and Mazda is using it and Mercedes is using it and Volkswagen is using it, they're all using the same piece of software. There's a lot more safety in that in terms of they're all using the same code. Their engineers are all looking at the same code and they're all debugging the same code. And when they find an issue, they give it back to the community and everybody benefits. And so once they understood this process and the value of open source, then it became easier for them to adopt it. And so that's how we approached it. Thank you. Very good advice. I was going to jump in in something similar, sort of echoing the last two speakers. Definitely financial services has sort of the special snowflake syndrome that we heard from sort of the networking side of the house. I think it's generally related to the fact that sometimes they hide behind the regulated nature to say, there's just things that we cannot do, but the reality is once you dig in, there's nothing preventing them from doing open source. So I think one of the ways open source has changed the industry is making them realize more and more that 80 to 90 percent of what they do is non-differentiating and it's just a waste of resources when if you think about it, this industry is really now heavily competing with big tech and the West Coast really aggressively entering the financial market. And so really sort of this push to be more efficient found a really good solution in open source. I think the second sort of related topic that I think is really changing the industry is the talent aspect sort of, you know, 10 years ago, most of these banks, there's plenty of articles talking about Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan as to how, you know, they had internal, even programming languages, you know, they went to the very bottom layer of the stack and building everything proprietary and everything customized. And maybe 10 years ago, that was considered the secret sauce for them. If you fast forward five to seven years, in the last three years, there's been a clear realization that actually that's a weight that is actually something that can become a witness because it's really hard to hire talent that then you need to, you know, train up on your internal platform versus, for example, you know, JP Morgan using the Python ecosystem that every single day builds new components and new talent. And so I think, you know, besides the differentiation, I think open source is really creating a whole new generation of talent that hopefully is going to result in a better financial system across the world. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot for your critical topic, talent and training. Yeah, if I could, I'd like to sort of build on what's Dan and Gabrielle are saying. Open source tends to be sort of the base of innovation. And there are components out there that are used widely beyond across all of our sectors. For instance, I think you'll see the Linux kernel for one of them is in a lot of these places already. I think it's in something like 70% of all embedded applications that are already running Linux. And so we've got that innovation there. And if you can leverage what is out there already to the points we've just made and focus on the value add and your differentiation, it's a much more efficient strategy. And quite frankly, de-risks things to a large extent. Rene, what's your perspective? Yeah, to add to everything that's already been said, I think when people, some people think about FOSS, they think about the free as in free beer, that it's cheap and inferior software. But in reality, it's more about the free as in free spirit where everybody can take part in creating the technology. And I think Gabrielle kind of alluded to that shift left where actually the consumers of technology can work side to side or shoulder to shoulder with the creators of the technology. And that leads to much shorter cycles of innovation. So it really opens up a new way for, let's say, the energy providers to work with their vendors and to kind of have a short feedback loop for what their requirements are and what their needs are, and making sure that the software develop really addresses their needs. So open source communities and open source projects provide this platform for this type of collaboration. Thank you so much. Yes, relation with the customer is key right now in the energy sector, of course. Good. So, well, I guess that after looking at the strengths, we can look at the potential pitfalls. So from what pitfalls should stakeholders look out for the transition process? Maybe I can start here. I know I care about some of these things pretty tightly. I think first off is security. Making sure that the projects you're using are based are sustainable projects, have well done, it's not just a single developer, it's you're going to base something on something, make sure that you have some diversity of community behind it, but that quite frankly also the community is paying attention to security and focus on practices in that space. So focusing on making sure you understand the security story of the projects you tend to incorporate, the open source projects you want to incorporate is first, would be the first recommendation. Second recommendation is knowing exactly which projects you're bringing in because a lot of these projects will bring in dependencies and so think technologies like software build materials or S-bombs and having a clear line of sight as to all of the components you've brought in and the implicit dependencies as a function of security but it's also a function of safety because you cannot go through any safety or regulatory things without knowing in detail exactly which pieces you're bringing in. So the transparency and being able, so one, the projects you're bringing in, make sure that you've got a sustainable ecosystem behind them and they pay attention to security and then two, know all the dependencies that they're bringing in. Thank you Kate. Do we want to go? Yeah, I think this may sound strange but I think one of the pitfalls is that companies want to form a consortium and they're all really eager to do it, they're all, oh my god, let's do this, this is great and then there's no funding and that's the biggest pitfall in my opinion. You have to fund these projects because these projects don't run themselves and so the software is free and it's open and you can go download it sure but the project itself, in order to build the community, that needs at least some decent amount of funding and a lot of companies don't realize that and they think they can, you know, throw a few thousand dollars at it and it's gonna be fine but I think, you know, raising funds to run the project and to build the community, have a community management in place and have events, things like all member meetings, these things are quite important to build a community in my opinion and then number two, I would say, if you're going to be creating original code for the project, the choice of license is quite important, you know, in most cases you have to pick a very business friendly license otherwise the adoption of the code will be really bad and so, you know, there's a lot of precedence in what license to pick so I don't think it's very difficult but you have to make sure it's a business friendly license for the members. I just want to sort of connect I think with what the last three folks said, I've heard so many times, especially early in the days, this idea of, yeah let's put this project out there and then, you know, the community will come and the reality is that, you know, it's not as easy and besides of course considering foundations as an help to grow your project, sort of shameless plug here but, you know, I want to hit on something that Rennie said, you know, when you put out an open source project either solo or in a foundation, you always want to consider how is it going to create an actual ecosystem and an actual potentially commercially viable ecosystem because ultimately, you know, we all know that open source is free as in free spirit but there's a lot of really valuable sort of virtual cycle that can be built around an open source project with then the idea of, you know, increasing the sustainability of that project both in terms of reinvestments, you know, touching on the funding that Dan mentioned and on the sustainability of the maintainers that Kate touched upon so I think it's really important to, when you think about an open source project, how you draw those sort of bright lines and maintain expectations that are both, you know, fulfilling the need of individual developers in the community and are aligned with the ethos of open source but that ultimately, again, touching also on the license choice, don't undermine the potential creation of a commercial ecosystem around that project which ultimately is going to be what fuels the sustainability of the project in the long run and I admit this is more an art than science still but it's something that I think, you know, it's becoming mainstream more and more and, you know, I think it's important that the energy sector thinks about this as well. Yeah and I would like to summarize maybe saying don't try to do too much open source at once and it may sound crazy because we're advocating here for open source but I've seen some companies trying to do too much open source at once and then diluting the resources, not having the funding, not having the personnel so I think my advice would be identify where it makes sense the most to start with open source, start there and then grow your open source involvement as you go, you don't need to go from zero to 16, three seconds, it could be more gradual, it makes sense to make it more gradual, learn from your experience and then expend more into open source over time. So well I guess when developers and industries in the energy sector try to undertake this transformation they may find it intimidating, the complexity of it may be intimidating. So what is your advice to those who have to undertake this journey in the energy sector for decarbonizing the energy system? So I would maybe start again tying to my last comment, start small. Yes, open source can be intimidating, things can go in the wrong direction real fast if you don't do it right. So it's really important to identify where it makes sense the most to start and start with something small and then build up on that. Yeah, I agree with that. You need to identify maybe the biggest pain point, maybe the top two or three things that companies are dealing with and struggling with and start chipping away at those things. In the case of Automotive Grade Linux, we first tackled infotainment because this was the biggest pain point for the car makers. They were not keeping up with the mobile phone but then eventually we went on to support instrument cluster, heads up display, telematics. So now we support all sorts of things in the vehicle but we started with the most important one which was the biggest pain point for our members and for our community. That would be my advice, is pick one to start with and go with that and you'll grow on that success eventually. I'll also say taking sort of the angle of go out and be in the community, find projects related to the things that you care about and have people sitting there and volunteering to do things so that you're seen as active in the community and you are contributing back and then as you start to find the people that care about the same problems as you, you have a basis to sort of build from but you also know the behaviors of the community and you know the points to watch out for has been alluded to already. I mean you mentioned both sort of corporate and individuals here and I think I couldn't agree more on the corporate side in terms of starting small, finding you know high value challenges and of course ideally seeding the solution with the you know an initial contribution or a project that is already out there that can be augmented. I also do think you know we take a lot of pride in trying to engage individual developers and showing the value of the work that we're doing in our community and financial services to individual whether that means you know incentivizing an award, whether it means getting sort of your next big job in a large financial institution. I hear a lot of talks of you know I realize that some of our communities being very professional grade can be you know considered daunting for an individual that you know maybe comes out of school and wants to engage in open source but the reality is that on the other side there's always a maintainer that is in need of help and so when I feel you know a lot of you know imposter syndrome I think my best suggestion again for individual we talked about a lot of corporates but for individuals even if you are you know engaging a potentially very complex project very sort of highly professional open source project just understand that on the other hand there's always someone in need of help and so that you know doing your due diligence reading the manual reading the documentation complying with the contribution guidelines is important but you know don't be scared take the leap it's almost like you know when you're jumping off a cliff the the just the jumping part is hard after that you know you're on your way. Thank you so much this was great we got advice for the entire sector and down to the individuals so thank you very much so I think our time is up I want to thank the panelists very for a very very interesting discussion and for energizing me and hopefully the entire energy sector towards this transition thank you all and have a nice evening. you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0,
