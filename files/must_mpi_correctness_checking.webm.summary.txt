The talk discussed the dynamic MPI correctness tool called MUST and the compiler extension called TypeArt. MUST is a tool that checks for issues and produces reports during runtime, specifically focusing on MPI type correctness. TypeArt is a compiler extension based on LLVM that helps with figuring out the memory allocation in MPI calls. The tooling was demonstrated using examples from well-known HPC benchmark codes and the impact on performance was discussed. The speaker concluded by mentioning that TypeArt enables local checks to ensure type correctness in all phases of MPI communication.
