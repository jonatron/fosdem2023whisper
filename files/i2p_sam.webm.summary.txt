In this talk, Conrad gave an introduction to the I2P network, an overlay network that provides users with anonymous and confidential messaging services. He then discussed how developers can use the JavaScript TypeScript library for I2P to build privacy by design applications without needing to deal with the complexity of the peer-to-peer network, and highlighted a few use cases for the library. The talk ended with a discussion of the latency cost of privacy and an open call for developers to join the project related to banking and chat.
