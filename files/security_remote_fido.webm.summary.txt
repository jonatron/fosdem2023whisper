In this talk, Alexander Bokovoy discussed how to enable secure passwordless logins for remotely-managed users. He discussed a Zero Trust Memorandum, currently in effect in the US, that requires organizations to switch to passwordless logins by the end of Fiscal Year 2024. He described how a combination of PAM modules, changes to applications, and centralized identity management can be used to formulate a secure passwordless system. He then presented a demo of the FIDO2 hardware used for authentication and shared instructions on how to get a test version of the technology up and running.
