{"text": " So this talk will be a follow-up to the one I did at the LibreFist conference last year in September that was about content controls in write or in general and some of the follow-up work was expected, some of that was more like a surprise, so a couple of incremental improvements appeared in the past half year, so it seemed like a good idea to overview where we are compared to where we were in September. So for those who don't know me, I'm Mikhail Shvindam and from Hungary, I used to be very much involved in the write or RTF import export so much these days, but I still focus on write or work for Culebra and for content controls for the scope of this talk, we talk about these rich tax content controls, it's like it's for for Finland, we used to have these input fields in write or already where you can provide some placeholder tax and you can mark that this is the place of the document where you can type when you fill in some form, but one big limitation of that was that it was built on fields and fields can't have formatting, so it was really just for plain text and where write or really shine says more like there can be a rich text, so we want something that provides rich text, so that's where you can have rich text content controls. The UX mass specification calls these structured documents tags, but it's really the same thing, they are user interface calls these content controls, so we also call them content controls, and the way it's structured is that you can once you have a paragraph text, then you can have multiple text portions inside that, so let's say you have some text, normal text, then some bold text, and then again normal text, then we split up the text, paragraph text to three portions, the normal one, the bold one, and again the normal one, and for fields the restriction was that you can't have multiple of these text portions inside that's to be filled in, and content controls support this, so you can have multiple portions, although they are limited to a single paragraph, at least this inline content controls that I'm talking about, so you can't have a content control starting at some random point in the document and ending at some random point, perhaps you know that you can do that with bookmarks, it might start inside the table and outside the table, and fieldmarks can provide the same thing, content controls are intentionally limited to be inside a single paragraph, so we enforce that when you create them, we enforce this when you edit them, we enforce this during exporting to DocEx and ODT, so this is something, this is an invariant that we want to maintain, another complexity is that it's possible to do nesting for this, so when you look at how we write this in XML, then XML elements naturally support nesting, and we call this well-formed nesting, so the outdoor content control starts, and then the inner one starts, and then it's a requirement that the inner one will finish, and then the outer one will finish, and so you can do nesting, but you can do these start ones start to finish them the first and finish the last, similar to what you know from HTML for example, so we want to support this setup that you can do nesting but not in a random order, and you can include multiple text portions but not random positions with start and then bottom constraint that they are in a single program, and if you have fields, then fields typically have some kind of instruction text like commands, and there is the field result, content controls are more like annotations and a piece of text, so you have some start and then you can have a bunch of properties on top of that, we will see you can give it a title, you can give it an alias, you can define the type and so on, so the rich text is the simplest type where you just say that you can fill in something here, and if the task is like provide your one line or command from this for them presentation, then and you say it was really bad, like really, really, so you select the really and market board because it was really that bad, but you can do multi-programs, you can't write a novel on how bad that was, so that was a rich text, and so somehow the picture is missing the top pixels, so you missed the whole point, but I will explain what you should see there, so it's called, I think the values in the interface cause this title, but in the markup we call this alias, but it's the same thing, the point is that you have some complex form and you are supposed to fill in the date, the date and the date and finally the date, and of course they mean that, that means you are registering your company and there was a date when you created the company, there was a date when you filed the papers for it, and there was the date when the first employee was hired and so on, but it's just the date, so it's very confusing to fill that in, and what content controls can provide is that when you enter that content control, then there is a small pop-up similar to when you edit headers and you get the name of the page style and so on, so you get some tooltap explaining what exactly you are filling in, that might be helpful, so let's say the text would normally just say that you need to enter information about the, let's say the birth data, but that means that they want the birth location and the birth date and then when you enter the content control they can give you this hand so that it's a bit easier, so the output, the field inform might conform to what was expected, how some regulation is to accept, but when you try to enter it as a more mortal, you are actually able to fill it in because you don't need to like look up some 10 pages of documentation, how to fill in that form, you go to the form and you get enough helpful context information so that you can just do that, so these aliases and tags were initially missing on the right-hand side, and now we support it, then one other problem was that, I mentioned you can have multiple text portions inside the single content control, so what you see on the above screenshot is that we have an x corrector, then a new line break, so we kind of hack it around, technically it's still a program, a single program, but you see it's on multiple lines, and then we even define some tab stop and then a tab portion, so technically it's still a single program, but you see that this is like at least three different text portions, and we used to take each and every text portion and then it's PDF widgets for that, so in this case when you exported this to PDF and you wanted to fill in the PDF form, then you got three different widgets, which is a nonsense, this was not the intention, so in case originally the placeholder text would be multiple portions there, your right turn, and we still take the bounding rectangle of the content control and just emit a single widget, as probably the user would expect that, then another thing is the primary use case we had in mind was that you create some editable writer document, and at the very end you export that to PDF, and the actual form filling will probably happen in some PDF reader, but you might also have some slightly different workflow where you mark most of the document as read only, and then you can have the editable document handed out to users, and they actually fill in the form in writer, now the trouble is that in case we made the document read only, then you can't fill in the form because you change this content control, and they are part of the document, and the whole document is read only, so that content control is also read only, now this was working with input files before, they had various problems, but this bit was working, they knew that they are an exception from this general read only thing, so it was possible to fill in input files, now we do the same, and we can have this setup that the whole document is read only, but the content control can be still added in. Another thing was that if you look at what Word provides for VBA, if you want to manipulate these content controls, then they have an understanding of what is the list of content controls in the document, this can be very handy in case you want to have some macro that automatically processes the already filled in document, now there are other ways to do that, but one way is that you write some macro that will extract all the fielding results from the document, and for that they can just go to the first content control, the second one query how many content controls you have in the document, but on the right side this is really just a formatting on a program, so you would have to scan the entire document to find out if you have any content controls at all, so we don't have this random access to content controls, until we did not, so initially we ignored this VBA problem, but when Justin was trying to build a VBA compact layer on top of content controls, then he found that there is no random access to content controls, so you can't do this without scanning the whole document, which can be very slow, so this is not great, and we discovered that actually footnotes already provide this, that's also kind of formatting on some piece of paragraph text, and that has this manager that will track as footnotes are created and deleted, and then you can quickly get a list of all the footnotes in the document, so why can't we do the same for content controls, and yeah you can do that, so now there is some star basic access, or actually UNO API access, and that's visible with me in basic, and also there is a VBA compact layer on top of that, where you can query how many content controls you have, you can, if you fill in these alias things, then you can even say that I want to jump to the birth date content control, without saying that is the third one, so if you insert something in between, then it won't break, so this manager provides that, what's necessary here, another thing was that initially when I was adding drop downs, I wanted to like incrementally extend what's available in rich text content controls, so the idea was that in case there are list items for this content control, you know that's then probably a drop down, but there is complexity there, you can have drop downs, okay, you can have drop downs, and you can have combo boxes, and it's possible that, and you can't say which one it is, if it has list items, it might be any of that, and also it turns out it's valid to have a drop down with no items, so that's what you see there, knows that's working, we explicitly track if that's a combo box or a drop down, and then you can have both types, we enforce that if it's possible to just choose one item from a complete list, or you can also have free form tags there, and also in case some existing document for whatever reason has no list items, then we don't break that, and we don't implicitly turn that to a rich text content control just because it has no list items. I think this is the last one, I say Hossain was doing lots of testing on content controls, and of course the first thing he was trying is some Parisian text, and of course it was breaking, I think it had three pieces, so one was the positioning, if you have the drop down arrow on the left-hand side now for archaeal text, that means that if you take the position of the whole bounding rectangle, then you need to shift that to the left to have the correct position, so fixing up the position based on the direction of the text frame, so the paragraph is what's one saying, then also what you were in the render inside the bounding rectangle for the arrow button and for that frame that needed fixing, and the last thing is that if you see a button, then you might have the silly idea to click on that button, and you expect that something happens, but we need to do this hit testing to show, to decide if you clicked on the button or not, and if you do that, then we need to handle this correctly for RTL versus RTL, so that's no all working, so this is it, there was some polish since the LibreFist conference is still, what the feature set it provides is still something that meant to be one-to-one possible to map to the word feature set, we tried to fully save this to UDF without any loss, you can export that to PDF, there are these various types, you can see a few types there, and basically more properties are added, some small editing improvements, and it's a little bit easier to script that now, so that's what we have, thanks for listening.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.44, "text": " So this talk will be a follow-up to the one I did at the LibreFist conference last year", "tokens": [407, 341, 751, 486, 312, 257, 1524, 12, 1010, 281, 264, 472, 286, 630, 412, 264, 15834, 265, 37, 468, 7586, 1036, 1064], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.27923570163008093, "compression_ratio": 1.558659217877095, "no_speech_prob": 0.016904616728425026}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 13.44, "end": 21.36, "text": " in September that was about content controls in write or in general and some of the follow-up", "tokens": [294, 7216, 300, 390, 466, 2701, 9003, 294, 2464, 420, 294, 2674, 293, 512, 295, 264, 1524, 12, 1010], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.27923570163008093, "compression_ratio": 1.558659217877095, "no_speech_prob": 0.016904616728425026}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 21.36, "end": 28.72, "text": " work was expected, some of that was more like a surprise, so a couple of incremental improvements", "tokens": [589, 390, 5176, 11, 512, 295, 300, 390, 544, 411, 257, 6365, 11, 370, 257, 1916, 295, 35759, 13797], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.27923570163008093, "compression_ratio": 1.558659217877095, "no_speech_prob": 0.016904616728425026}, {"id": 3, "seek": 2872, "start": 28.72, "end": 39.12, "text": " appeared in the past half year, so it seemed like a good idea to overview where we are compared to", "tokens": [8516, 294, 264, 1791, 1922, 1064, 11, 370, 309, 6576, 411, 257, 665, 1558, 281, 12492, 689, 321, 366, 5347, 281], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.20551416907511966, "compression_ratio": 1.4371584699453552, "no_speech_prob": 0.00031805437174625695}, {"id": 4, "seek": 2872, "start": 41.04, "end": 48.16, "text": " where we were in September.
