{"text": " I'm here thanks yes hello good morning and nice day for foster them hope you had a nice evening yes let's start with the torque matrix RTC matrix beyond instant messaging let's get that so first of all what is matrix maybe we have some redundancy a little bit here but for the sake of the recording and I'll repeat some of what Matthew already showed us so basically the idea is an open and federated secure and decentralized real-time communication network and the use cases are many for it so the obvious one is of course the interoperable chat but we are also aiming for voice of IP applications or even VR applications but you can also think of something like IOT data and this is so most of those use cases you're quite familiar with and what's the well-known event layer so for chat for instance you have a store and forward semantics however the cool thing about matrix is that it is yeah constructed such a way that it is de-central it is federated and what's for me pretty cool and important is this replicated and end-to-end encrypted so for instance if you're a client on one of those hosts here and you're attaching to one home server and you're joining a room from another home server at that moment the rooms replicated and everything is end-to-end encrypted it is pretty cool it's like like a git git clone something like that similar with an automatically your synchronization mechanism on top of it I'm quite sure that you're very familiar with it you could also summarize it matrix is a de-distributed real-time database and I can recommend this talk here from my colleague Andy it's a very nice overview of what the specifics here on the other side this talk today is about matrix RTC and now what is the definition of matrix RTC what was it so there's basically it's the world first de-central federated real-time channel or communication platform and it's packed in msc341 and msc3898 and it's depicted here what basically the idea is from a client perspective you have a peer-to-peer semantics and we don't have a storage or persistency in it but you can exchange data with a low latency and a low jitter from one client to the other and another interesting thing here is that the business logic is owned by the clients though in most recent RTC platforms or video conferencing platforms you have something like an SFU and an application server and here the idea really is the business logic is in the clients let's have a look at some use cases so the most obvious of course is video conferencing right that this is what everybody would you know assume when you talk about RTC but we can also have the embedded version here so let's just take a normal matrix client and put a widget into it and then have audio video conferencing or go to the VR world or the the matrix interpretation of the metaverse which is called third room everything can be realized using matrix RTC and the cool thing here is that you can also think about a hybrid use case so for instance imagine we have a whiteboard like we have this here so we can use for fast UX the matrix RTC layer such when I make a stroke now that it's more or less immediately at the other whiteboards but for persistency we can just use the room the distributed database so what are the base building blocks which we use to create matrix RTC so first of all of course we need something like a real-time communication framework and the obvious choice at the current point in time is web RTC because it has a quite good adoption it's in all the web browsers and there are a lot of a lot of SDKs around we can use but going forward maybe you can also sing something like web transport or web codex to to replace it so we are not mandating web RTC but for the time being that is of course the framework to use then for the signaling that's quite obvious that we use matrix for it rates and then to make it scale you might optionally also want to use a back-end component a focus this could either be an MCU or an SFU so now as I stated the back-end component is optional let's have a look on start matrix RTC without an back-end component so having a look at the connection models so the obvious and the simplest one to start with is peer-to-peer right that's just easier create a peer connection and then you have a they have a data layer and then you can play around with matrix RTC it's getting a little bit more complicated if you want to to have an RTC session with more than two people so then we spin up a full mesh and then it really depends on the use case how many people can join if you have a look maybe at the use case of video conference then you would need to distribute n-1 media up links and down links which is then limited by your internet connection and if you're having at least in Germany an average DSL connection it would scale to up to five to eight participants and this is something we're currently using in an element call to element call to the current point in time is based on this full mesh setup or was we have some news today the the vision which also really scales and would allow a large scale RTC sessions is what we call cascaded selective forwarding units and it's depicted here so what you would have you would have a selective forwarding unit as long side with your home server it's optional but you can have it and by this we then would allow a further scaling and can really yeah using the cascading concept to dynamically crawl to any size we have to test it but that's the theory so far the signaling here of course is also carried out over matrix and for the for the specifics for the SFU we have this MSE 3898 which handles then all the the magic of the cascading and so on and so forth from a setup perspective if you want to scale large network and large RTC network the idea is that you place the SFUs as close as you can to your customers or to your clients and to ensure a proper internet so this ensures a proper internet connection with low jitter low packet loss and then you have the SFUs placed in a strong network center and have a good interconnection and by this setup you have yeah that's that's that's the best you can do in terms of media quality so what we did we started with an SFU which is capable to speak the matrix flavor of of RTC it's a prototype which was handed over from Sean from the inventor of the pine stack and it's a Golang based web RTC implementation we added the matrix bits to it we wrote a lot of it it's early stage but we have support for audio channels we have support for video channels and screen sharing and on top of that recently we also added so-called similar cast support similar cast is you can imagine that maybe have to go step back so in the full mesh mode you have a literally a peer-to-peer connection to each of those clients and by adding some signaling you can the receiver can tell the sender oh I'm struggling with a network connection can you please adapt your your network bandwidth from from the encoding side and this is a little bit harder if you're having a central point the SFU so here the trick is that the sender will provide several media quality levels and then on the SFU the client can decide which one to choose low quality mid quality and high quality and this is called similar cast and we all already have basic support for similar cost in our selective forwarding unit matrix is known for privacy and end-to-end encryption and in the full mesh set up of matrix RTC that's quite easy because you have the transport layer which ensures end-to-end encryption but if you terminate a peer connection on an SFU the transport layer is of course terminated and hence we need media encryption and this is the missing part here so using insertable streams you need going forward to implement end-to-end encryption on the client side that such that the media is encrypted on the client send over and then it's not an issue on the SFU for this specific topic matrix RTC and cascaded foci or a selective forwarding units we have later a dedicated talk for my colleague Shimon it's the in-depth talk cascaded foci it will be in this no not in this room it will be online at 2 p.m. this day so now we have an idea of what the vision of matrix RTC is and what we can do with it we have seen so far the use cases let's come back to element call I think we demonstrated it last year right yes very early very early and after one year you could imagine something happened so first recap what's what's element call it so initially it was developed on a green field as a single page application in the cool story here it's just a matrix client right it's not for chat it's a matrix client and the implementation was using the full mesh so without a back-end component so what's new so after this year first of all in our site or not site project our partner project hydrogen we also have call support right now and it's also working interoperability so you can start with hydrogen the call and join this element call and the other way around we added the SFU bits to element call and we integrated it into element web so in element there we now have two flavors of element call we have a crew call experience we are just press the crew call button and we have dedicated video rooms which is pretty cool so the semantic of this room is that when you press or click on this room you're asked to join the conference immediately the question is how to embed element call into a matrix client in general so in theory you could just implement the msc's but that would be very expensive because then you need to implement in each platform expensive in terms of engineering bandwidth so all requirements are one implementation which fits all and the idea is yeah that we embedded element call or the embedded element call needs to share the same underlying matrix client and room in order to not waste resources or to have device proliferation so the idea is quite obvious let's use a widget for it also short recap on widgets what is a widget a widget is basically an application living in a matrix room it's simply an embedded iframe and it's yeah a small form factor web application html JavaScript the widget is embedded within a room and can communicate with matrix clients and therefore from the matrix client through the widget API and this widget API is a defined post message API basically a widget is able to request permissions and to perform on actions on the user's behalf something like posting into a room receiving specific event types and so on and so forth to have a more easy a way of approaching widgets we have also have a widget SDK which is written in JavaScript and TypeScript it's basically a web app and now here we have an overview a few about element call in the various flavors so in the single page application the mode it's just the matrix client using the client server API and in the widget mode here we are going through the widget API over the underlying matrix client and then to the home server the abstraction layer client server API versus widget is a really thin so from a development perspective that was really easy to implement yeah so the solution is it's just a widget it's web RTC in a web view and this is the nice thing so the the whole web RTC stack to implement on various platforms is quite painful but if you can just a web view where this is included for free that's that's a thing we needed to extend the widget API to add some missing bits specifically where the 2d rice messages and to access the turn server also spec in the msc's and this this whole concept we call matroshka embedding where we have a web view hosting widgets in the various clients and that could be a web client but it could also be the native clients like the iOS and the intro lines and hence we have the solution one implementation that fits all let's have a demo right so what you see here basically is just the desktop application of element element nightly on the left hand side you can see the various rooms with various flavors so here this is a general room and he has already a conference started so if you press it you will join it and at the top here we have a so-called video room and you're now if you join it directly prompted to to join a conference and what you can also see here is the chat so let's join it hello I raised the volume here so hi Enrico hi Simone yeah welcome to foster them what we can do here right now is that we have various flavors so we have a new layout here which we call large crits design and you can yeah change the tile sizes and I also added here some debug information and you can see that the small video on the top left receives the low quality stream whereas the large screen or a large tile on the bottom receives the mid quality stream hey Dave hello so and so and now we want to carry out an experiment I have a QR code here hopefully I find it yeah and I encourage everybody to join the call and to crash our SFU let's load test it sorry with chrome yeah yeah I will do but that's the resolution the projects are good enough we'll put the URL in the bedroom yeah so let's see so of course if it's not working then we can blame the Wi-Fi here right yeah it's slightly unhappy now no no no it's recovering it's recovering so we plan a second demo later the day with the talk from shimon so yeah but so how many do we have it depends okay let's say I leave it in the background play around with it and we go back to me talk okay so what's what's next in the matrix RTC ecosystem of course we want to implement the whiteboard at least the hybrid version of the high pot then the very important thing really to is to yeah to start with the insertable streams to also have the end-to-end encryption in case of using the SFU with respect to the selective forwarding unit we need to implement the focus selection logic so if you remember the craft where we had the other picture where we had the the home servers alongside the SFU's alongside with the home servers we sketched out a nice algorithm where you can automatically choose the right one and this is something we need to implement right now yeah and then obviously the cascading this has not be started the implementation but yeah we need to carry out on the similar cost layer we also have some optimizations in mind for instance I think it's only a good idea to upload your video to the SFU if on the other side someone consumes this video stream so this is an optimization we can add and I think also the the switching point where when you change the layer from high quality to low quality there's also some room for improvement on top of that we need to care a little bit more about network bandwidth rate control this is an important thing we need here such that the SFU also feeds back information back to the client such that the client is then in a good position to adapt the local yeah video audio encoders and finally we want to extend the call support in hydrogen and that the SFU bits to it and now maybe some of you are wondering a little bit why Matthew is sitting here with his classes yeah and now let's head over so what we have so far seen was the obvious use case for matrix RTC which is a video conferencing solution but I told you earlier that we also have something like the metaverse interpretation of matrix and we call it third room yeah and in a half minute yeah any questions though on the floor answer yeah it's hard Q&A part apologies for being the idiot with a VR headset on it's gonna start streaming in a second so wanted to talk about third room which is the social collaboration platform that we have built on top of matrix and I'm gonna slightly mess around with trying to get this to work at the right resolution because it's going to look crap if it's not over right whereas how do you change the resolution these days in macOS but you know how it's actually changes refresh rate that's not helpful that's not me yeah and is that your fault that it's like streaming it's the wrong one thank you too many death rooms you should play be using the same one and 2001 online death room no it's not the online death room normal death room yes what is it I can't spell matrix this is going well that one right thank you okay we sure that looks totally squashed that's literally why I'm trying to fix right now I'm gonna be to actually set a resolution on this thing these days how about I press that button where we're gonna go to run yeah so it's gone to four by three but it wants to do four by three everywhere but it's not four by three it's 16 by nine let's go to that well I look thank coming in on the stream all right just check this it'll be worth it don't worry on the plus side the Oculus thing is cakes in good right yeah this is looking good so let me actually bring up third room so the point of third room is that it's a tiny team it's sorry okay hi everybody welcome to my talk on third room which is a project tiny project done by three people Robert and a an AJ AJ also famous for doing Sydney as matrix client which is trying to show people that matrix is way more than chat and VoIP I know that it's called to look at 3D stuff these days and go don't like 3D honestly I think this is incredibly interesting in showing the potential of what we have to build on top of matrix today now the way it works is that you've got hydrogen SDK going and basically providing a plain old matrix client and if I jump into this room here which is hash presentation on third room.io if people want to play along at home feel free to come and jump in and heckle my presentation and you can see that this is a virtual world going and sitting in browser if I pull up the frame rate which is obviously control shift s you can see it's actually going at 60 frames a second I'm indeed you're stuck in the floor it's running at 60 frames a second in browser at well 1080p as we all just saw which is pretty impressive for a fairly complicated scene that we have going on here and the way that third room works is quite unusual in the it's properly multi-freaded in browser it's using an entirely new game engine that the team basically put together and I should hasten to add I've basically been encouraging people rather than actually working on this but Robertson and Sanfran and so it'll be cruel and unusual to get him to do this and talk and I've even got some slides here and it's showing the scripting that is built in that I'll talk about it in a minute now the interesting thing is that we're using shared arrayed buffers to go and share data between the main thread and a bunch of worker threads using post message between these and then the atomics API's and the browser so that you can actually have properable multiple threads in order to have the rendering thread running completely independently from the gaming thread that does physics and the main thread that does react and does hydrogen because with embedded hydrogen in a react app here as well as matrix so if I go to the next slide here are so on the main threads we've got react matrix and WebRTC happening and we have spatial audio in here so if I actually unmute myself oh I've got first for myself on my own talk that's annoying let me pause that amundini still out there somewhere you want to come over and say something to me it's anybody else I'll go over to you say something yeah okay so if we had headphones on at this point and I turn this way and you say something it's coming out the left speaker and you have to believe me and look the other way and it's coming out honestly it helps the immersive experience massively that we're going using spatial audio to go and position where things are here whilst we're wandering around here you can see that we've got at the moment generic avatars but if you walk around a bit and you can see her moon walking backwards for whatever reason I'm sure you can also go forwards there we go and fly for that matter and so the B button lets you fly in this so you can go and jump around like so and so you're spoiling my talk so if we go down here then on the game thread we've got a bunch of rust we have the ability to run arbitrary WebAssembly scripts which is sitting in a sandbox which allows you to basically add any arbitrary functionality into the world from a pure matrix perspective this is probably the most exciting thing here now if you remember IRC and Merck scripting the ability to run arbitrary scripts on your IRC client this is effectively allowing you to define bots and arbitrary functionality in matrix which run inside your client inside the sandbox and the actual data is stored in your room now this whole thing is a matrix room right if I go and hit enter then well you can see a bunch of users there I can say hello world and if I go back to my element client and if I literally join presentation on thirdroom.io for matrix.org then I can you can see I'm Dean saying yeah and I can say yeah to you too and hopefully hang it off well I've got traffic running one way interesting well we should be seeing messages coming into the room as well because it is there we go it's just a plain old hydrogen overlay that is being rented in react for the contents of the room now the actual geometry of the room if we start flying around some more looks like this is actually a big GLTF or a single GLTF asset this thing is just sitting in the media repository in the room it's just a file that is GLTF the transfer format for OpenGL that has been uploaded there and also any scripts in the room like the one which is executing the let me press on the buttons here again there's a bit of I think JavaScript using the quick.js engine that has gone and compiled down the JavaScript to web assembly in real-time it's pretty cool that you literally write it in JavaScript and then the engine sucks it up turns it into wasm and runs it within that sandbox so you could argue it's a little bit perverse to be taking JavaScript compiling it to web assembly and then running it from within a JavaScript environment but it gives you a hell of a lot more safety than you would if we were just I know having random blobs of JavaScript running here on the render thread we are using WebGL2 and we're using Freejs to manage the actual driving of WebGL but the scene itself is the scene itself is managed using a really cool technology called Bit ECS that was actually created by Nate one of the developers before he started working on they before they started working on third room and Bit ECS is a entity component system where you basically trap the state of the world the objects that exist within it their transformations and it's done with arrays in JavaScript and it turns out that if you stretch your arrays intelligently enough in JavaScript you can get as good as web assembly performance and it's one of the other secrets to the crazy and performance that we have here so this isn't a scene graph API under the hood like a frame if anybody ever played with a frame instead it's using the Bit ECS then another thing which is interesting here is that everything is some triple buffered so and a kind of traditional game engine you just have one sort of buffer that you write data into and the renderer reads it out and you have some kind of locking system to make sure that it doesn't collide whereas here we have lot free data structures letting things go as rapidly as possible with the various different bits of the engine writing into these shared this shared triple buffer as a shared array and buffer which is then juggled effectively between the various different threads and it means that the render thread can run at the native speed of whatever device which is particularly useful if it's a less powered device than my MacBook Pro here and then the game engine that is actually rendering what's going on can go at its own speed so you totally decouple the two and you get as high a frame rate as you can and I think that oh yeah and finally lots of fun stuff going on with asset optimization pipeline particularly the textures have been highly compressed using these fun codecs I think it's called universal basis format from binomial and KTX and one of the things we've done to cheat to bootstrap third room is to build a pipeline from Unity where you can take existing Unity assets like this scene here is one that we bought off a Unity assets store and then export it as proper open standardized JLTF somewhat liberating the contents from the slightly proprietary world of Unity in order to get content in more rapidly and then compress it down and there are lots of fun things like the it has instancing support built in so if you start generating lots of objects like the physics engine here I know going create a whole bunch of objects and attack the various people who are wandering around in here I'm sure they love me for it and then this is basically just the same JLTF asset going and being created multiple times all the textures are sprighted so there's just one great big thing there's also some really interesting extensions to GL that we've contributed by the Kronos group and particularly if you look at if we grab one of these mirror balls which are mainly used for debugging purposes let's grab that one and if I run around with it while I fly around with it you should see that the reflection changes there we go like if I go between zones there it's not they need to be tuned a bit but basically rather than ray tracing which would be incredibly time-consuming instead we have lots of different probes hanging around the scene that allow you to so I'm hitting myself in the face with the ball a common problem but as you run around you can see the reflection changes it's pretty nasty if you do it rapidly but if you're doing it more slowly like this and it's a quite a subtle but nice effect and it's even better when it's on not perfect maribles if you look at say Dave if you walk backwards if you can hear me or go into the light or out of the light then you actually see a fairly subtle shadowing effect as it's gone and figured out where the shadows are there right guys cool to see all the people running around in here so what else can I show you one of the so we're gonna launch some tech preview 2 of this next week and this is the first time anybody has seen tech preview 2 and I have 10 minutes yet left on and some tech preview one is sort of what we've been looking at here except it didn't have scripting we've already shown some of the scripting here but one of the big things sort of being added and let's pray that this thing works is web VR so hopefully if I go to the Oculus streaming thing which I had a second ago should have possibly cleaned this up first of course it stopped working well I get this thing back in again and everything is going wrong apparently I've got to recalibrate the entire thing so I apologize for using proprietary technology but unfortunately there aren't any open source headsets which do the trick yet there we go and let me try to cast this up and unfortunately it takes ages for the screen casting to kick in for some reason but I'll go as quick as I can bump and cost and computer go right so WebXR is a really cool technology it's been there for ages now since about 2017 built into browsers like Firefox and Chrome obviously and also interestingly the browser that your Oculus and Quest like this or Quest Pro has built into it which is based on Chromium it has awful screen casting support as you can see and that I started at screen casting and something is happening in the depths of Facebook trying to figure out how to actually get this onto the screen here but hopefully it will come through assuming I've got internet connectivity here it is thank God and I can start talking and I apologize for I'm going to focus on very interesting so I'm going to focus on Flora in rather than embarrassing everybody else but let's just use a stationary boundary confirm right so the browser here sits there I'm not going to update this right now but here is some third room and if I continue into third room as guests you can see this is just a static boring old web browser just sitting here worth noting that third room uses OIDC entirely so this thing here is actually a skinned key cloak I'm gonna say I'm not a bot I'm not gonna bother giving myself a name and then capture failed brilliant thanks Google I'm gonna have to type in third room except caffeine and stress means my ability to use a stupid keyboard like this is gonna be fun okay about to third room here is a streaming okay okay brilliant let's go to login go about third room continuous guests this time hope that it's not gonna make me pick stupid things right good continue accept the T's and C's honestly the using a key cloak for this is really really fun and very anticlimatically we end up with eventually monthly connectivity a 2d version of third room just sitting right here so isn't it amazing by the way that just loaded from index DB local storage but the fun thing is hopefully come on you can do it you can see it's actually struggling quite a lot in this but if I press the old X button there that's I have to close the welcome to third room dialogue here it is come on and to XR thank God for that then I can see Florian hello Florian but more excitingly hopefully if I stay in the right place there we go you can see that I'm actually in the third room environment right now and this is genuinely cool this is running at 90 frames a second for me right now and if I go and press some buttons to crates and oh god crates like that massive crate let me get rid that you can see it's actually hooked up to the normal physics engine so I can go and pull that and I can confusingly throw it into the audience which is no way surreal to be going and flipping back and forth and then back in the normal world again at the moment we've just got basic things like the joystick and hung up hooked up to it it's got a kinematic controller and I'm I running out of oh no thank you Florian what else can I show you if you can jump we can spawn more objects I can go after that glitter globe and sorry Mirable except is running faster than I can run after it that's awkward and theoretically if I was a little bit close to the bloody thing I'd be able to grab it and pick it up etc so this is pretty cool honestly it's as good as the native non-web VR and closed stuff that Facebook or meta horizons does and the entire thing is open and they built on the surgery mentioned how am I doing for time three minutes in which case I very quickly go and sorry thanks for I will stop looking at random emissives go back into this and just look at some other things we've done in fact this one is really cool let's just flip into this one because this is a really complicated bit of wasm it's actually an audio reactive widget which is sitting here as you can see as I yell at it it goes and changes size and this is a whole bunch of C code that has been compiled down to wasm to show how you can have interactive things sitting inside the scene another example is slightly less excitingly a chat box echo service so if I go into here and say hello and then do echo hello with a slash command it says hello back to me now the echo that's happening down there is actually being done from the widget API of matrix going into web assembly talking to I think a JavaScript service and then echoes back and you can see we have a slight bug sometimes with scripting where it loads two worlds at the same time and that's pretty surreal and that's what happens if London got combined with Mars final thing here I was going to show you oh yeah is this guy which is a bit silly but fun anyway and this time I'll remember to refresh as fun as it is to have the scenes combined so you might recognize this from a certain film and if we actually look at the script for this particular room if I could figure out how to get out of fullscreen mode the script here is again just sitting in the media repository it's a little bit of JavaScript and to use the web scene graph API which is a new API that we've created we hope it will become a W3 standard for manipulating scene graphs it looks a lot like Dom you basically get a node by name the TV and then every frame you'd see if the TV is being pressed and if it is then you enable the matrix material and the end result is if I go here and I click on the TV then predictably enough you end up in a matrix style world and I've got it in third-person view which is also new with tech preview 2 and clay back and forth this is super early but you can imagine this is basically a platform for doing any kind of real-time collaborative app could be figma on this it could be multiplayer blender it could be a game it could be digital twins it could be I know smart cities GIS applications it's as powerful and inslexible as the web but for real-time thank you very much and we have no time for questions one question oh it will be coming in the next release after tech preview 2 I mean the hub bit of actually rigging up the engine and doing all the inverse kinematics and if you run around with the current avatars you can now trip over things which is very important but suffice to say we're focusing on the engine rather than the assets and also this is at a point where people can start contributing things so if you've got amazing assets if they support the maximum rig then they should just drop straight in cool", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 20.44, "text": " I'm here thanks yes hello good morning and nice day for foster them hope you",
