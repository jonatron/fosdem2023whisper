The speaker discusses the process of porting the game Doom to the browser using Blazor Wasm. They explain that game porting involves adapting the source code of a game to run on a different platform and that it cannot be done through virtual machines or emulators. The speaker chose to port Doom because it is a popular first-person shooter with well-separated game logic and assets. They used Blazor Wasm, a component-based framework for.NET, which allowed them to write the code in C-Sharp and run it natively on the browser using WebAssembly. They demo the ported game and discuss their porting strategy, highlighting the need for optimization and avoiding extensive logging. They also mention future steps, such as using JS interop, updating to Managed Doom v2, adding game music, and playing other WAD files. They conclude by emphasizing the fun and possibilities of game porting and the power of WebAssembly for making existing code compatible with the browser.
