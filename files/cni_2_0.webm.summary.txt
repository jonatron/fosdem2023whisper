The talk discusses the importance of the Container Networking Interface (CNI) in Kubernetes networking, which defines how pods communicate with one another. The speaker emphasizes that although CNI is container orchestration agnostic, users should not ignore it because it provides valuable networking details. There is a movement to integrate CNI more closely with Kubernetes and create a better user experience by containerizing plugins and creating a richer lifecycle management of networking in containers. The speaker also invites people to get involved in the Kubernetes network planning working group to help advocate for CNI 2.0.
