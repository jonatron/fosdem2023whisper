The speaker, Guidier, presented a project called Mercator, an open-source web application that helps organizations map their information systems in order to meet operational requirements of cybersecurity. The application allows users to manage the mapping of their information system as described in the information system mapping guide from the ANSI. Mapping is different from inventory, as it focuses on the schematic representation of a set of information and its relationships. Mercator helps identify the most critical and exposed systems, anticipate possible attack paths, implement adequate measures, and ensure necessary protection through adequate mapping. Additionally, the application generates several reports such as the information system mapping report and physical inventory reports, with the help of a REST API and an analytical dashboard. The speaker also emphasized that, for the most part, the information needed to complete the cartography is not something that can be automated or derived from standard inventory and configuration management, and the work has to be done manually.
