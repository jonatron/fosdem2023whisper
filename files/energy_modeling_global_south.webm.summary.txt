Robbie Morrison gave a speech on energy system modelling and the importance of open-source community-driven projects. He discussed the Open Energy Modelling Initiative, an informal collection of modellers that have about 1,000 people involved. He also touched on the benefits of open-source projects for the global South, including low costs, transparency, and lightweight technology transfer. One of the main challenges facing open-source projects is interacting with official agencies, and many data standards in the electricity sector are proprietary. To overcome this, Morrison believes that policy should be based on peer production from a communal pool of data. The main solution for Europe is CC by 4.0 as a policy. There is currently limited funding for open-source projects, but Morrison believes that this will change as funders become more interested in the open sciences component of modelling.
