Mathias Horvat, a staff software engineer on the Mozilla localization team, gave a talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 about using Pontoon to localize open-source projects. Pontoon is an interface that interacts with repositories storing English strings and translations and is used by hundreds of contributors who are volunteers and spend their free time translating Mozilla products. Pontoon is easy to set up as long as the project meets certain requirements, such as using GitHub as a storage for translations and using supported file formats. Although Pontoon is designed specifically for software localization translation, it is open source and available for other users outside Mozilla. The talk was followed by a Q&A session where questions were asked about whether Pontoon supports complex translations, Firefox translations, Fluent support in other libraries, and quality checks.
