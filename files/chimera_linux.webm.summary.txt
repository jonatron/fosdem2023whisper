The talk was about a new Linux distribution called Chimera Linux. The speaker, a software developer from the Czech Republic, discussed the motivations for creating the project, which included creating a well-rounded and practical operating system that could be used by people, improving software portability and security, and making use of the unique strengths of LLVM. They explained that Chimera Linux utilizes core tools from FreeBSD, such as the muscle library, and it uses the LLVM toolchain to compile all packages. The distribution is also highly portable to different architectures, including Arch64, Power, and X8664. The speaker talked about the development process and the various components of the project, including the packaging system, the service manager, the build system, and the kernel. They mentioned that they plan to release an alpha version in the near future and continue adding more software and cooperating with upstream projects.
