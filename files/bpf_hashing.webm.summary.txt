In this talk, Anton discussed the use of different hash functions to optimize BPF hash maps, stack trace maps, and bloom filters. He benchmarked and analyzed the performance of a number of different hash functions, including jhash, spooky hash, xxh32n64, and xxh3, concluding that xxh3 outperformed the other hash functions for small key sizes and jhash2 was a better choice for larger key sizes. He also suggested using O3 for the hash map as it could benefit from it.
