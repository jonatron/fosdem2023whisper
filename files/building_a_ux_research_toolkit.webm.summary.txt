The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about the Bitcoin design community's mission to improve the global adoption of Bitcoin through open collaboration and working together. The speaker discussed the community's online space in the form of a Slack channel where various projects work on open source initiatives. They also mentioned the development of a UX research toolkit for the Bitcoin ecosystem, which aims to provide resources and tools for projects to create more user-centric products. The speaker highlighted the challenges they faced in building the toolkit and how they adapted their approach based on feedback and collaboration with other UX researchers. The ultimate goal is to reach out to open source projects, test the toolkit, gather feedback, and build case studies to showcase its effectiveness.
