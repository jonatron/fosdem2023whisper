WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.840
Okay, so thank you very much for attending this talk, and obviously thank you for the

00:12.840 --> 00:18.280
organizers of the bedroom for accepting the proposal.

00:18.280 --> 00:27.240
So that's my name, I'm coming from Upper Nebula Systems, my idea today, I'm coming here not

00:27.240 --> 00:33.160
as a competitor of OpenStack, and coming here to talk to you about the work we're doing

00:33.160 --> 00:43.000
at the European level, along with other European companies to align the geo-strategic interest

00:43.000 --> 00:51.360
of the European Union with what we are actually doing at the open source sector in Europe.

00:51.360 --> 00:58.080
So that's my email, and you want to just follow up with any questions after the session

00:58.080 --> 00:59.080
today.

00:59.080 --> 01:05.120
As I mentioned, apart from being at the part of Open Nebula Systems, I'm also part of the

01:05.120 --> 01:09.400
European Alliance for Industrial Data at some cloud, which is an initiative I'll explain

01:09.400 --> 01:16.680
later today, or later now, run by the European Commission, and also part of another initiative

01:16.680 --> 01:24.960
we call sovereign ads, which I'll explain also in a few minutes time.

01:24.960 --> 01:31.440
So just to bring you some ideas, I'm sure most of you are already familiar with some

01:31.440 --> 01:38.480
of the concepts and the strategy, let's say, behind what we're doing right now at the European

01:38.480 --> 01:47.120
level. We've mentioned before, and you're perfectly aware of the fact that the cloud

01:47.120 --> 01:56.800
market in Europe is, I wouldn't say broken, but it's not balanced at least, let's say.

01:56.800 --> 02:03.880
So these are just some figures of the growth of the cloud market in Europe in recent years

02:03.880 --> 02:10.320
and how the share of European cloud providers has evolved over time.

02:10.320 --> 02:16.920
So what we basically see is that the market is growing enormously, but the share of the

02:16.920 --> 02:21.440
European cloud providers is actually declining. So all that business and all that value is

02:21.440 --> 02:29.440
being generated by also part of the, also through the pandemic to cloud computing, that is mostly

02:29.440 --> 02:33.080
benefiting hyperscalers.

02:33.080 --> 02:38.800
So also you're perfectly aware of this. So we are now witnessing this kind of change

02:38.800 --> 02:45.320
of paradigm. So we're moving away from the kind of cloud centralized model to a more

02:45.320 --> 02:51.880
decentralized approach, this kind of, this shift of paradigm between cloud computing

02:51.880 --> 02:57.600
and edge computing that most of you, I'm sure, you're aware of.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.400
And we know, we all know it comes with a number of benefits. We're talking about deployment

03:02.400 --> 03:07.240
of applications, ultra low level, ultra low latency applications, improving user experience.

03:07.240 --> 03:12.920
Think about sectors like online gaming or healthcare. I mean, there are a number of

03:12.920 --> 03:18.640
functional advantages to this, but from a European perspective, there's also a key element

03:18.640 --> 03:24.560
in moving away from cloud computing, a centralized cloud computing model dominated by hyperscalers

03:24.560 --> 03:31.240
to a decentralized edge computing model in which other companies have a say.

03:31.240 --> 03:37.680
And that is to also foster here in Europe a new ecosystem of infrastructure providers

03:37.680 --> 03:42.880
that can bring some balance to that market. So we are assuming that the cloud market is

03:42.880 --> 03:49.240
dominated by hyperscalers, non-EU companies, that's, honestly, that's unlikely to change.

03:49.240 --> 03:54.000
What we can do is leverage this shift, this new paradigm of edge computing, where we know

03:54.000 --> 03:57.040
there are going to be a number of demands for this new infrastructure that doesn't exist

03:57.040 --> 04:02.040
yet, or this technology that doesn't exist yet, to bring some balance to that market

04:02.040 --> 04:06.080
and allow a smaller companies in Europe, for instance, to build their own infrastructure

04:06.080 --> 04:11.040
offering, bring that to the public with these new platforms, new technologies, hopefully

04:11.040 --> 04:15.080
based on open source, as I will explain in a second, and bring some balance to the market

04:15.080 --> 04:20.760
that's now heavily, heavily unbalanced. And to the point that we all agree and also the

04:20.760 --> 04:30.960
commission that we call it a market failure. So it is so complicated, so unbalanced, that

04:30.960 --> 04:35.640
now it's very difficult for a new company to get into this market and actually survive

04:35.640 --> 04:41.160
against these big players. Okay. This is especially relevant in Europe

04:41.160 --> 04:47.920
because we have a powerful tool here, which is the telecom sector. And as I explained

04:47.920 --> 04:51.360
in a second, many of the initiatives that are taking place now in Europe, they rely

04:51.360 --> 04:56.400
or they hope that the telecom sector in Europe will come together and will help to build

04:56.400 --> 05:02.240
this alternative edge infrastructure that we'll be able to bring and offer an alternative

05:02.240 --> 05:07.840
to hyperscalers. We need to get the telecoms involved and that also means we have to fight

05:07.840 --> 05:12.120
sometimes from the open source perspective, but in general, for this new change of paradigm,

05:12.120 --> 05:18.200
we have to fight against the temptation in some companies in Europe to align their priorities

05:18.200 --> 05:24.680
or get some agreements with hyperscalers to speed up the deployment of edge infrastructure

05:24.680 --> 05:33.160
in the market. But we all agree that this might come with some risks in the midterm.

05:33.160 --> 05:40.280
I think we all agree on that. So I'm going to explain today what we are doing at the

05:40.280 --> 05:43.560
European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge and Cloud and other initiatives that we're

05:43.560 --> 05:50.680
moving and promoting from the European open source sector. The main challenge here, if

05:50.680 --> 05:54.360
you think about what the future is going to be or what kind of challenges we're going

05:54.360 --> 05:58.720
to have in the future, in the near future, I mean, obviously there are many technical

05:58.720 --> 06:03.160
challenges and political challenges as well. A basic one, which we still don't have an

06:03.160 --> 06:09.880
answer for that, is how we're going to manage if by the end of the decade we actually have

06:09.880 --> 06:14.560
tens of thousands of edge nodes across the continent, how we're going to manage all

06:14.560 --> 06:20.240
that infrastructure, how are we going to manage thousands of edge nodes with different architectures

06:20.240 --> 06:25.960
from different brands, from all of those managed by hundreds, potentially hundreds

06:25.960 --> 06:31.560
of different infrastructure providers. That's the whole idea. So how we bring all this new

06:31.560 --> 06:36.560
emerging infrastructure together, how we build the tools for a user, for a customer to actually

06:36.560 --> 06:40.360
leverage all this new infrastructure that's still to come, and how to make that in a way

06:40.360 --> 06:47.200
that doesn't bring us again to a new scenario of vendor locking. So how can we make sure

06:47.200 --> 06:50.960
that all these workloads can move freely from one place to another, how can we automate

06:50.960 --> 06:56.160
all these deployments, how to make this really easy for people to actually use these thousands

06:56.160 --> 07:00.240
of edge nodes that will be available in the market here in Europe, hopefully in a few

07:00.240 --> 07:04.360
years' time. So that's a very specific technical challenge that we have to solve right now

07:04.360 --> 07:09.360
and we have to decide how we fix that and whether we want to fix that as Europeans or we want

07:09.360 --> 07:15.720
to again rely on non-European organizations and companies to do this for us, which is

07:15.720 --> 07:20.400
very comfortable, but then at some point we realize we don't have the skills in Europe

07:20.400 --> 07:30.400
to take over these projects if something happens. So I talk about the alignment. So there is

07:30.400 --> 07:37.120
a gradual alignment and sometimes quite explicit from what kind of the signals we get from

07:37.120 --> 07:42.960
the commission in this case and what the industry as a whole in Europe is doing, but specifically

07:42.960 --> 07:49.960
the European open source technology providers. So there are some very clear declarations

07:49.960 --> 07:56.000
from top EU figures about the need to achieve this kind of technological sovereignty in

07:56.000 --> 08:03.520
some way or another, trying to coexist with hyperscalers but hopefully creating some alternative

08:03.520 --> 08:10.840
scenario for Europe. Happily there are also quite explicit declarations on the role that

08:10.840 --> 08:15.720
open source is expected to play in all this and there is a commitment to do this and I'm

08:15.720 --> 08:20.960
happy to say that the discussions we have within the alliance to define these technology

08:20.960 --> 08:24.640
priorities and these co-investment priorities, they are quite well aligned with the fact

08:24.640 --> 08:30.280
that these technologies have to be open source and open source is the way to mobilize this

08:30.280 --> 08:35.320
collaboration between different companies in Europe. Obviously that doesn't mean proprietary

08:35.320 --> 08:38.880
software is not going to be there because it has to be there and it's the base of some

08:38.880 --> 08:45.120
business models out there, but open source is going to play a key role in all this. Again

08:45.120 --> 08:50.160
we see this aligned with what we've read from the commission through a number of documents

08:50.160 --> 08:54.520
that I'm sure you are familiar with and also with declarations from people like Commissioner

08:54.520 --> 09:02.960
Thierry Wirthon. As I mentioned before, one of the practical challenges is how we believe

09:02.960 --> 09:09.640
what the digital decade strategy says will have by the end of this decade thousands

09:09.640 --> 09:14.960
of notes across Europe, how are we going to manage this infrastructure? What's the technology

09:14.960 --> 09:19.480
that's going to allow new infrastructure providers to offer this to their customers? So that

09:19.480 --> 09:26.440
technology doesn't necessarily exist right now. That technology in any case we think

09:26.440 --> 09:31.920
should be European if we want to extend this concept of sovereignty down to the technology

09:31.920 --> 09:41.360
stack and just leave that at the data level or at the cloud provider level.

09:41.360 --> 09:48.300
We see also in the reviewed industrial strategy from the commission that the role that edge

09:48.300 --> 09:52.320
computing is expected to play in this, in all this, in this data processing that's moving

09:52.320 --> 09:59.320
away gradually quite rapidly. Sometimes from a centralized cloud to the edge, we're going

09:59.320 --> 10:03.320
to use that to actually bring some balance to the market. So make sure that European

10:03.320 --> 10:09.320
companies have something to say in that and the model doesn't replicate again the kind

10:09.320 --> 10:14.760
of oligopoly structure we have in the cloud market. So that's the role of edge computing

10:14.760 --> 10:19.600
and that's also increasingly the role that open source is perceived or expected to play

10:19.600 --> 10:25.040
in bringing different companies together to build this in the long term and maintain the

10:25.040 --> 10:29.920
whole thing running because obviously we can't really say things but we need a long-term

10:29.920 --> 10:34.560
commitment from the European industry not just to consume technologies but also system

10:34.560 --> 10:39.200
integrators as well, not just to consume technologies and sell them and resell them but also maintain

10:39.200 --> 10:43.000
them in the long term. That's one of the main challenges we'll have.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.120
The European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge and Cloud, that's one of the steps, one

10:50.120 --> 10:55.280
of the initiatives that the commission has put in place in which the European industry

10:55.280 --> 11:00.480
is playing a leading role here. So it comes back from a declaration from Member States,

11:00.480 --> 11:07.880
the commitment to support these new technologies, cloud edge technologies. If you read this

11:07.880 --> 11:12.560
original declaration which they committed to expanding all this transformation around

11:12.560 --> 11:18.880
10 billion euros, I don't think we'll get that much but it's, as explained later, quite

11:18.880 --> 11:23.800
decent amount of money involved in all this but we see even in this declaration there

11:23.800 --> 11:29.480
are already some references to at least something that sounds a bit like open source something,

11:29.480 --> 11:37.240
the open source standards, whatever that is but still it's good to see it's in there somehow.

11:37.240 --> 11:44.520
So the Alliance was born in 2021, there was an initial publication of an industrial technology

11:44.520 --> 11:49.640
roadmap from a number of European companies at the CEO level. It was then launched at

11:49.640 --> 11:54.920
the end of 2021 by Commissioner Thierry Breton and I'm happy to say that by the end of February

11:54.920 --> 12:02.240
probably we'll be in good condition to publish the updated version of this technology roadmap

12:02.240 --> 12:06.800
with all the technology priorities that have been identified and deployment priorities that

12:06.800 --> 12:13.080
have been identified in Europe from the industry perspective but also in alignment with the

12:13.080 --> 12:21.360
division of the European Commission. The Alliance brings companies, private companies,

12:21.360 --> 12:26.160
European, only European companies, Member States and then also a number of experts are

12:26.160 --> 12:31.560
involved in this, in these discussions. We had our first physical general assembly here

12:31.560 --> 12:37.600
in Brussels in early December, it was quite successful. The idea is again as I mentioned

12:37.600 --> 12:46.760
align and identify these investment needs, these priorities, how to bring together the

12:46.760 --> 12:51.000
expectations and the needs and the potential of the industry in Europe with what the Commission

12:51.000 --> 12:58.440
is actually expecting or their vision, what Europe needs in coming years and these challenges.

12:58.440 --> 13:03.400
Right now there are three working groups, one of them is for Member States. This is

13:03.400 --> 13:09.920
mainly people involved in discussions on procurement. So they're looking at how to,

13:09.920 --> 13:17.760
from a procurement perspective, help European companies and cloud providers in daily business

13:17.760 --> 13:22.600
with the administration in different countries. The main question we get from them is should

13:22.600 --> 13:29.840
we restrict contracts to only European companies and it's very tempting to say yes but personally

13:29.840 --> 13:36.280
I will say you take the decision, I'm not, I'm just a company, that's something for

13:36.280 --> 13:40.520
you to decide. Obviously that will benefit us but I mean discussions are more complex

13:40.520 --> 13:48.400
but that's one of the topics that keeps coming up many times.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.840
And then there are two working groups for industry, one of them is the cloud edge working

13:51.840 --> 13:58.960
group that we chair along with another two companies with CapGermany and SAP. And then

13:58.960 --> 14:04.760
there's a specific working group for everything that has to do with cloud for defence and

14:04.760 --> 14:09.720
aeronautics sector. Which I'm happy to say some of you were earlier this morning in this

14:09.720 --> 14:15.280
debate I had with Gael from Eclipse Foundation. It was striking for me personally to see all

14:15.280 --> 14:19.640
these people coming from the defence industry saying that they want to use open source.

14:19.640 --> 14:27.200
So the internal debate is not about proprietary source or open source, they want to use open

14:27.200 --> 14:32.280
source, they just need help to make sure that they can use open source under the very specific

14:32.280 --> 14:39.200
restrictions they have in this sector. So I think that's a good news for everyone.

14:39.200 --> 14:43.960
So the Alliance, not all the logos here because it's an old version but as you see some of

14:43.960 --> 14:48.880
the main actors in the European industry as a whole not just technology providers but

14:48.880 --> 14:54.800
people from other sectors as well contributing to this, cloud providers as well. There was

14:54.800 --> 15:00.440
as I mentioned the first version of this document released in 2021 and we'll have that released

15:00.440 --> 15:05.920
in probably end of February. So one of the ideas is also for those of you who are familiar

15:05.920 --> 15:10.360
with all the different programmes that the commission has in place, things like Horizon

15:10.360 --> 15:17.760
Europe or Digital Europe or the SEV, to make sure that from industry we feed the commission

15:17.760 --> 15:22.960
with what's actually the challenges and the needs we have in terms of advancing all these

15:22.960 --> 15:28.160
technologies for cloud and edge and to make sure that the new calls and the new actions

15:28.160 --> 15:32.400
under these programmes are aligned with what we actually from the industry identify. So

15:32.400 --> 15:40.240
it's like giving a quick channel to give feedback to the commission to what these topics could

15:40.240 --> 15:46.000
be in terms of helping us also advance that. So that's the structure of the Alliance. I'm

15:46.000 --> 15:54.320
also here to invite all of you if you come from a European company and your business

15:54.320 --> 15:59.840
is relevant to cloud and I guess that's why you're here right now. There's an open process

15:59.840 --> 16:04.720
to join, it goes through the European Commission, you can join the Alliance, you can join the

16:04.720 --> 16:09.400
different working groups and participate. Maybe it's a bit not too late for this new

16:09.400 --> 16:13.320
version but there will be new versions and new working groups during the rest of the

16:13.320 --> 16:20.360
year and it's a long-term commitment from these companies to participate in this.

16:20.360 --> 16:30.640
So that's what the European Commission side has to do. In the meantime, from the more

16:30.640 --> 16:36.160
specifically from the open source, from the European open source industry, we've also

16:36.160 --> 16:43.120
been working in having some more cooperation and collaboration among ourselves. In 2021

16:43.120 --> 16:50.320
we launched an informal initiative or community called Sovereign Edge. It's about bringing

16:50.320 --> 16:56.320
together European open source technology providers that have some, they develop some technologies

16:56.320 --> 17:01.560
or we develop some technologies in Europe that are relevant for edge computing and this

17:01.560 --> 17:06.400
change of paradigm and we think it makes sense to get closer to each other and get to know

17:06.400 --> 17:11.440
each other a bit better and integrations and all that and going together to some of these

17:11.440 --> 17:16.160
projects that will be coming up in the near future.

17:16.160 --> 17:22.640
So we've started with an informal community of European open source companies. We produce

17:22.640 --> 17:27.840
software and we already have some level of integration among ourselves. The objective

17:27.840 --> 17:33.160
is at some point to offer an alternative stack of European open source technologies for public

17:33.160 --> 17:39.720
administrations and companies and system integrators. Also with making sure that we have connections

17:39.720 --> 17:45.080
with all the European relevant European cloud providers to offer at least an alternative

17:45.080 --> 17:53.000
that goes beyond data and cloud. It also covers the technology that sustains all this.

17:53.000 --> 18:03.080
We launched this as I mentioned in 2021 informally. At the end of 2021, I'm quite proud of this.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.680
We didn't get this money but I'm quite proud of this because this was the first time the

18:06.680 --> 18:13.240
European open source industry came together to apply and submit a Horizon Europe project

18:13.240 --> 18:18.640
to the commission. We didn't get this money but it was a very nice experience to try to

18:18.640 --> 18:25.840
bring people who have never ever considered to go into a research or innovation project,

18:25.840 --> 18:32.760
a European project coming together and preparing this proposal. As you know, it's a lot of work.

18:32.760 --> 18:39.440
Finally we got the second time. This is the COVNIC project. It has started now in January.

18:39.440 --> 18:45.560
We coordinate this project with a number of other organizations involved. It's going

18:45.560 --> 18:51.760
to be running for three years. I'm happy to say this is the actual implementation of this

18:51.760 --> 18:56.560
initial collaboration between European open source providers and their research and innovation

18:56.560 --> 19:02.000
ecosystem in Europe to produce some technology together and respond to some of these calls

19:02.000 --> 19:09.680
from the Horizon Europe program. Finally, just to finish, a very quick introduction to another

19:09.680 --> 19:17.560
initiative that's now ongoing, which is the important European interest for next generation

19:17.560 --> 19:24.680
cloud infrastructure and services. It says for friends. We've been preparing this for

19:24.680 --> 19:32.880
what? A couple of years or so. This goes through the next generation funding. It's led by

19:32.880 --> 19:38.280
Germany and France with heavy support from the commission. In total it's 12 member states

19:38.280 --> 19:42.120
are going to mobilize funding from the commission, I mean from European funding through their

19:42.120 --> 19:50.640
national budgets, the state aid is called, to set up this huge project for clouded continuum

19:50.640 --> 19:55.440
and at different levels. We have, I cannot disclose the companies, the specific companies,

19:55.440 --> 20:01.040
but it's European industry, telecommunication companies, software developers coming together

20:01.040 --> 20:08.480
to, cloud providers coming together to build a whole stack of the technologies on the advanced

20:08.480 --> 20:15.440
services we need for infrastructure applications and data. So it's really exciting. It will

20:15.440 --> 20:21.200
cover a number of challenges. We won't go into the details here, but it will be available

20:21.200 --> 20:27.680
on these slides. But yeah, things, big topics like interoperability, portability, I mean

20:27.680 --> 20:32.360
meta orchestration across different providers, avoiding vendor locking and managing all this

20:32.360 --> 20:36.520
huge heterogeneous infrastructure that we expect to be in Europe in the coming years.

20:36.520 --> 20:42.840
This is going to run, we pass all the tests and all the questions from the DJ competition

20:42.840 --> 20:49.280
and the rest of the commission. It will start hopefully this year, the second semester or

20:49.280 --> 20:57.200
so. It will be running for five years. Yeah, that's my personal opinion, but I think the

20:57.200 --> 21:01.920
components that we are building or will be building in this project, they have the potential

21:01.920 --> 21:08.040
to actually become, you'll see when this is published, the equivalent to the semiconductor

21:08.040 --> 21:13.480
or the hydrogen epsi project that are already approved. But I think the open source that

21:13.480 --> 21:17.600
we'll be producing here hopefully will have the potential to become the probably largest

21:17.600 --> 21:25.120
open source project in Europe in the coming years. So stay in touch because we'll need

21:25.120 --> 21:33.920
help. And also an invitation for you to follow this new project that we are starting now

21:33.920 --> 21:44.760
under the Horizon Europe program. Thank you.
