WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
One minute, please sit down, everyone.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
I'll start.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Whenever you're ready.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Okay, team.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
You started?

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to our third call, where we have Vincent.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
Vincent Turu is a UI engineer on Mozilla Privacy and Security Products Team,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
working on tools like Firefox Relay and Firefox Monitor.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
And he's going to talk about over a decade of anti-tracking work at Mozilla.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah, thank you, Francesca. That was actually the first sentence of my presentation just gone now.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, so I worked on the Privacy and Security Products Team.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah, and so I want to start this presentation with a bit of a personal anecdote.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
My open source journey started with the release of Firefox 1.0.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
It was my first interaction with open source software.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Later started using Linux, started contributing.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
First with translations, later I became a software engineer.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
But I only joined Mozilla as an employee about a year and a half ago.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
So for this presentation, where I'm going to discuss a little over a decade of anti-tracking work at Mozilla,

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm going to be leaning a lot on the experience of my coworkers,

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
specifically Luke Crouch and Max Crawford, other engineers on the Privacy and Security Products Team.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
They wrote this blog post, so most of the content of this presentation is also in that blog post.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
So if you want to have a quick high-level recap, you can read that afterwards.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
It's also linked on the FOSTEM side, I think.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
But Luke has been at Mozilla for basically forever.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Mozilla went through and through lots of institutional knowledge,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
so lots of the content is by him.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Max did most of the illustrations, so that's credits where credit is due.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
So tracking. It can be beneficial.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
I want to do one short scary slide and then the rest will be more positive.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
But I want to take a bit of a moment to discuss the risk of tracking.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Why are we actually trying to minimize the harmful effects of tracking?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
So tracking is a personal risk.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
You can fall victim to phishing attacks, for example, or the people around you can fall victim to it.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
So if more of your data is known, or if your data leaks,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
it can be used to impersonate you and get, for example, people around you

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
to transfer large sums of money or whatever.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
So, for example, if someone contacts my father and says,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
hey, it's your son, could you please wire me 5,000 euros?

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
You know, it's a lot less believable than if they were to say, hey, it's Vincent.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
I just got fired from Mozilla. Hopefully, it never happens.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
But, you know, could you wire me 5,000 euros because I'm in money trouble or whatever?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
That's a lot more convincing.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
So data can be abused, but it's also more of a societal risk.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
So ransomware has been in the news a lot recently.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
It costs a lot of money.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
It can even be used to convince people not to vote

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
if they are aligned with a certain political party or et cetera.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
So there's risks involved with tracking.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
The rest of my presentation should be more positive.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm going to discuss what we're doing to minimize those harmful effects

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
to allow you to confidently use the internet carefree.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
So there's a variety of ways to track you.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Historically, a lot of attention both inside of Mozilla

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
and outside of Mozilla has been given to tracking cookies.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
So I'll start my presentation with an overview of what we've been doing there.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
And then I'll go over these other forms as well.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
So cookies and a bunch of related technologies that all call cookies.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
There are bits of data that websites can store on your computer,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
which can be useful.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
So if you load a website and the website sees a bit of data that proves that you are you,

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
it can decide to give you your shopping cart or your private messages

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
or whatever and not show someone else's.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
So that's a good thing.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
But it can also be used to track you if you don't want that.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
So every website you visit can set cookies.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
But not just that website.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Websites can also embed other websites.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
So for example, a website could contain a YouTube video

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
and then YouTube can set cookies as well.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It can contain ads.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
And then those are often also served by a third-party website.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
It can also set cookies.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Websites can even embed other websites without just seeing them.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
So for example, with the goal of tracking you, so those can also set cookies.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
So we've been clamping down on that primarily through Firefox.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
So I'll start my overview with Firefox Private Browsing introduced in 2008

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
after Chrome was released, which had an incognito window.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
But a private browsing window is basically a window that as soon as you close it,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
forgets everything you did in there, forgets the cookies that were stored as well.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
It's often jokingly referred to as porn mode,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
but it's definitely also an anti-tracking tool.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
So for example, my girlfriend used it as such.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
She's a kind of ridiculous Harry Potter fan,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
like participates in international pub quizzes about Harry Potter level.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
But she's also a high school teacher.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And so sometimes she'll need to show, I know,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
a video of something that happened in the news recently.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
And she'll go to YouTube, share her screen, and show a YouTube video to her class.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And she doesn't necessarily want her entire private life,

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
which is entirely Harry Potter, shown in the YouTube recommendations.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
So what she does is at home, when she's, I don't know,

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
listening to YouTube, to Harry Potter music or ASMR or podcast or whatever on YouTube,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
she'll open a private browsing window and do that thing in there.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
And then if she closes it, then YouTube can't correlate those two sessions.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
So won't show Harry Potter recommendations when she's sharing something with her class.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
Another reason why I'm starting my overview with this private browsing window

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
is that we interpret, if someone uses a private browsing window,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
we interpret that as a signal that someone wants less tracking

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
and is willing to accept some more breakage.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
And so unfortunately, often when we're trying to block tracking,

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
websites assume that they can track you and then build their functionality on that.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
So there's a risk if you combat that, that you break the website.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
So whenever we want to introduce new measures to combat tracking,

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
we'll first introduce it in private browsing, see how much it breaks there,

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
and then later we can try to port it over to your regular browsing window.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
So that's why I mentioned private browsing first.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
In 2013, we introduced more granular cookie control,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
so you could make that trade of yourself as a user.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
You could choose, for example, to not use cookies at all.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Lots of breakage. You wouldn't even be able to log into websites anymore,

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
but also remove that tracking vector.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
You could also choose to, for example, not the third party cookie.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
So if you visit a website, then that YouTube video that's in there

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
might not be able to set cookies.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Less breakage, but still quite a bit.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
So it gave you that control, which is helpful,

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
but it's also kind of out of the way you have to know of these options.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
You have to understand what they do, understand their risks,

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
and just making that trade between breakage and less tracking

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
isn't a great one in the first place.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
So later on, we also introduced a block list,

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
so that it's basically a list of cookies that we know are just used to track you.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Don't provide any functionality for you as a user,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
and we allowed you to block those cookies.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
So less breakage doesn't prevent all tracking, but helps there.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
And then not too long ago, 2021, that's really state-of-the-art

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
anti-tracking cookie work.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
We introduced what we call total cookie protection,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
so that doesn't actually block cookies,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
but for example, if you visit youtube.com,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
and then later visit a different website that also includes a YouTube video,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
they'll both have cookies, but they'll be different cookie jars.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
So YouTube will still not be able to correlate those two sessions.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
So that helps prevent that tracking vector

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
without actually breaking it, because from YouTube's point of view,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
they still have cookies.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
So that's the work so far.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Obviously, the timeline here stops at 2021.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
We're in 2023 now, but they're still the future,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
so we're always working on more things to come with that.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
But that's my overview of cookies so far.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
With that, let's move on to IP addresses.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
So IP addresses are basically addresses for every device

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
that's connected to the internet.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
They are relatively stable.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
They can change, but most of the time,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
most devices have the same address.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
And this is a pretty strong identifier.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Like, for example, I'm the only one that uses this phone,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
often has the same IP address,

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
so everything you can link to that IP address is quite sure to be me.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Same goes for this laptop, for example.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
And they're not just able tools to link you,

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
but they're also often correlated to your geographical location.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
So it's not super specific, but when I'm at home,

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
you can deduce from my IP address which city I am.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm in.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
So, yeah, that's the risk of IP addresses,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
so whatever we've been doing there.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, like cookies, oh, I forgot this.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
So the thing with IP addresses,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
it's inherently if two devices connect to each other

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
via the internet, they can see each other's IP addresses.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
And so that means by virtue of connecting to a website,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
that website will be able to see your IP address.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
And again, websites can embed other websites,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
so those embedded websites can also see your IP address.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
So just like we did for cookie protection,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
we introduced a block list of IP addresses

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
that are known to track you and not provide other functionality.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
As I mentioned, first in private browsing later,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
also gave you that option in your regular browser window.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Which is good if you never even connect to a tracking server

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
or to an answer or whatever, it can't track you,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
it can't see your IP address.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
But obviously, we can only do this for connections

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
that don't provide any functionality.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
We can't start blocking YouTube.com

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
because you won't be able to view that video anymore.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
So to battle that, in 2019,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
we introduced Firefox Private Network,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
which is in between your browser

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
and the website you're connecting to.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
And so instead of connecting directly to that website,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
you'll connect to Firefox Private Network

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
and then Firefox Private Network connects to the website

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
you're trying to view.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And then from the point of view of that website,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
it will see the IP address of Firefox Private Network.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
And so in 2020, we expanded that to your entire device

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
with Mozilla VPN, which protects not just your browser traffic

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
but everything on your device.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
And you can also use it on multiple devices.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah, so that's our IP protection so far.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah, then I'll move on to email addresses,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
which is the fun part because I work specifically

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
on Firefox Relay, a product here

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
that I'll discuss in a second.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
But first, there's a question that blew my mind

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
when Luke first mentioned it.

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
But email addresses, they feel like you can easily create

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
a new email address, right?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
You go to g1.com, enter a username and a password,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
and you've got a new email address.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
So they feel like they're easy to change.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
But in practice, you've probably changed your house address

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
more often than you've changed your email address.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
I've moved a lot, I don't know,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
six times in the past 10 years, maybe,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
but all the time I've been reachable

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
via the same email address.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
So if you have that on file, there's so much history

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
about me that you know via that email address.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So it's a pretty stable identifier,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
and it's cool if you block all your third-party tracking cookies

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
and you hide your IP address,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
but if you then go on and sign in with your email address,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
they can just correlate that back together.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And this happens, for example,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
you go to an online store and you buy clothes or whatever,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
and you sign in with your email address,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and then have the clothes delivered.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
From the point of view from that store,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
you're a very attractive customer.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Like, compared to some random other street,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
you're far more likely to make another purchase there

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
than some random person is, right?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
So what that store then does is they go to Instagram

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
or whatever, and they're like,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
hey, here's an advertising campaign.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Here's also a list of all the email addresses

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
of our customers.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Could you please show those ads to those customers?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And so from the point of view of that store,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
that's great news.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
They can advertise to you, you're a high-potential customer,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
but from the point of view of Instagram

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
or Facebook, Meta, whatever owns it,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
it's even better because they have not just your activity

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
on Instagram and Facebook and WhatsApp, et cetera,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
they also know, hey, you're a customer of that store

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
and of any other stores that have done the same.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
So lots of ways to track you,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and that's the voluntary part,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
voluntary data sharing by third parties.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
But in 2018, I believe, we introduced Firefox Monitor,

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
which basically keeps track of data leaks that happen.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
And if you sign up for Firefox Monitor,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
it will warn you if your data was found in the data leak,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
if there was a hack or whatever,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
to remind you, hey, maybe you want to change your password.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
But what we saw is that many people use the same email address

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
at different services.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
So if there's data leaks in different services

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
with the same email address, you can link the two data leaks,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
the data in the two data leaks,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
you can link them together and know that they're about the same person.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
And many people even, probably not all of you,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
but other people also use the same password

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
across different websites.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
So even if there's not a data leak in a different website,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
by using your email address and your password,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
they're still able to extract data from those other websites.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
So that's obviously not great.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
So in 2020, we introduced Firefox Relay.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
And what basically Firefox Relay does

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
is it provides you with a unique email address per service.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
So if you have a sign-up form, you need to leave your email address,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
you hit the Relay button, and it will generate a new email address.

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
So I know ZQF40 at Mozmail.com, for example.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
And it will forward all email that goes to that email address

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
to your true email address.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
So the store will still be able to communicate with you,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
send your emails at that address,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
but that won't have your actual email address on file.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And so if there's a data leak there,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
your data can't be linked to your data elsewhere

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
because you have two different email addresses there.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
So that's Firefox Relay.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Oh, actually, I'm doing well on time.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
You're welcome, Francesca.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
So then lastly, phone numbers.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
So kind of similar thread, right?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
It was super annoying when I started to use Relay,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
and cool, you can leave your email address,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
and I'm like, I've got my Firefox Relay address,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
you can catch me, and then they're like,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
can you give your phone number, too?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Bit of a shame.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
So what we did is late last year,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
we introduced phone masking for Firefox Relay,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
added this graphic to our website,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
but it worked similar to email masking.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
You get a phone number mask,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
so a new phone number, and all the text messages,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
all the phone calls that go to that phone number

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
will be forwarded to your true number

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
without having to share your true phone number.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
And so if you get, for example, a text message saying,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
hey, it's your bank, could you please

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
change your password and go to this website and change it,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
that's an additional signal where you can see,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
well, this is not actually my true phone number,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
which my bank has, so this is probably a scammer.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
This is a pretty new addition,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
so unfortunately for probably most of you,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
also for myself, especially given that I work on it,

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
it's not available outside the US and Canada yet,

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
but hopefully soon.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
But yeah, so the point there is lots of this work

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
is like the broadening of the scope

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
beyond just tracking cookies.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
That's all quite recent works.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
You should saw like 2018 onwards,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
we started to broaden our focus.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
That's also when the security and privacy products team

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
around then started.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
So yeah, we're not done yet, obviously.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
This is the overview of the timeline so far.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
And yeah, if you have any ideas of what we can do,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
do leave them on Mozilla Connect.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
And that's, I think, everything I had.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Damn, my practice was so much slower.

17:39.000 --> 17:49.000
Thank you very much.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
And so does anyone have any questions?

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
So especially with the IP and email protection,

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
it really seems like you are a single part of Pavia.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
What do you do to mitigate any resistance?

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
So the question was if, especially for Mozilla VPN

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
and Firefox Relay,

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Mozilla is kind of the single point of failure there.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
And yeah, that's true.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
So the point of failure here is,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
for example, for Firefox Relay,

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
if you're, imagine we're doing everything to prevent it,

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
but imagine there's a data leak at Firefox Relay.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
What then happens is your email address still gets public,

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
which is annoying, obviously.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
You're basically back at where you were before, right?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
But there's just one place where you could fill,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
i.e. Firefox Relay, rather than all those places

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
that store your other email address.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
So yeah, it's annoying.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Ideally, we'd have, I'm not sure,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I'm sure Luke has probably a couple of ideas

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
around minimizing that that we might look at at some point.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
It looks like you have an idea.

19:10.000 --> 19:18.000
Because especially if you like the central place where you store everything,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
you become a very attractive target.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Yeah, that's true.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
So yeah, if we're a central place that has lots of email address,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
obviously we become a bigger target.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
That is true.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
I wouldn't say right now, Firefox Relay and VPN as well

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
aren't that big compared to there's far bigger data faults.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
So that's definitely something we're aware of

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
and want to minimize.

19:45.000 --> 19:53.000
I think right now, at least for me personally,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
for me personally, it's still worth it, right?

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
The risk is smaller for using Firefox Relay.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
If I want to order a ticket, for example, like a concert ticket,

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
I'll give them a relay address.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
They'll forward me the ticket and I'm done with them

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
and I never need that again.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
If you're interacting with your bank, for example,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I would use your actual email address.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
So yeah, there's definitely a risk calculation to make there.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
All these products are not a perfect solution.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
I think that's basically the threat in all this.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
It's all about trying to find that balance,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
trying to block cookies, for example.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
It's all trying to find this balance,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
how much tracking do we want to allow

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
and how much breakage do we want to allow

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
and there's always tracking that we can't prevent

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
and there's always downsides of our anti-tracking measures

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
that we can't prevent.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
So yeah, I wish I had a better answer, but that's it.

20:57.000 --> 21:03.000
We have a question also in Matrix.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
It currently doesn't work with Chalk.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Ah, okay.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
So Danny on our Matrix is asking that,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
yeah, so he's asking about five folks

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
relay phone number masks,

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
not working with a bunch of tools.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
That is something we're aware of and working to fix

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
for those who are familiar with phone number masking.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
So my question is, is it correct to state

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
that at the moment none of the services

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
have been demonstrated to actually treat our data

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
end-to-end as an end-to-end encryption

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
so that you can't see our data?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
And the following question to this question

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
is do you have any plans to implement

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
end-to-end protection?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Is it even realistic in this case?

21:53.000 --> 22:01.000
So the question is, do we end-to-end

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
and crit the data we're handling?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Obviously not applicable to everything,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
like cookie, et cetera, not.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
For emails that's basically not possible,

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
because we need to know your email address

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
to actually be able to forward email.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
We don't store the emails we forward,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
so we get them for them to you and forget about them.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
So...

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Damn it.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
VPN, actually I'm not sure.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Maybe you're biased the way I am.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Is that encrypted?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I think your connection via VPN is encrypted, right?

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
So, yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
VPN works in a way that you generate like...

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
We're using one.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Sorry for putting you on the spot, but...

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Hi.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah, so the Mozilla VPN works

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
using the WAGA protocol.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
So on the client, you generate your own private key

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
and you only upload the public key

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
to the Mozilla VPN network.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And then during the server handshake with a partner,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
you generate the session key.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
So essentially, even if your public key gets leaked,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
we can't see anything.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Yeah, so VPN is end-to-end encrypted.

23:10.000 --> 23:19.000
We can't see what you pass through there.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
Hey, I wonder how does Firefox Relay prevent spam?

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
What kind of mechanism does it use to catch spam?

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
So there's a basic spam filter.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
We make sure that if...

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
So if we forward our email and you mark it as spam

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
in your inbox, Firefox Relay gets a signal

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
and stops forwarding emails to that email address

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
to that spam.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
You know, it's spam.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
Does it use a spam assassin or R&B?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I wouldn't know.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
So the question is, what service do we use to detect spam?

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
Come to our matrix and I'll find out for you.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Yeah, our backend engineers will know

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
that I'm not involved with that part of the implementation.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
But we do have a number of anti-spam

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
and anti-abuse mechanisms in there

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
that we don't want to get blocked by other people as well.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Thank you for the talk.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
It might sound like a stupid question.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
You mentioned the three or four products like Relay, VPN,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
and Monitor.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Are they free, including the VPN?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
No, so the VPN is paid.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I would also recommend you not to use a free VPN.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
They're almost all shady.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Quite a few of the paid ones are also pretty shady, actually.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
No, so the VPN is, I believe, if you pay annually,

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
I think five euros a month.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
I see not, so that's good.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Firefox Relay has a free plan,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
which gives you just five email addresses.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
So that works, but then if you want to get every service

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
a unique email address, that's not great,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
but it costs one euro a month.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
And Monitor is free.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
Yeah, and so part of this is also,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
part of what we're doing at Mozilla

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
is building these privacy-protecting tools.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
We're also trying to find ways to have those finances themselves.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
So yeah, we're not trying to sell ad or anything.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
You pay for it, you're the customer.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
That's the idea there.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Last question.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
So I think it's pretty obvious that the technologies

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
that are being used to track us now

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
kind of almost require us to have a sort of centralized entity

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
to sort of resolve it, whereas cookie protection

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
could be kind of done decentralized.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
And that obviously makes Mozilla as an organization

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
kind of a target of critique, I guess,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
because you become centralized to some sort of tracking.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
Is there some sort of track or something that happens at Mozilla

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
to mitigate the risks of being a single entity

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
that could store too much information?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
For instance, in terms of relays,

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
there is separate entity that, or an entrenched thing

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
that tries to ensure that you don't store too much data,

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
so that at least you can't kind of try to monetize it yourself.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Yeah, everyone can hear it, right?

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
So one strategy there that we have at Mozilla,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
we have our lean data practices,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
so that means collect as little data as possible.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
That's one way to mitigate that.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And that's why Firefox Relay,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
it's why we only store your email address,

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
we don't store the emails we forward.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
You can choose, so you can choose to store

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
associations like which masks did I use on which website,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
but you can also choose to have that stored locally

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
if you have the extension, or just not store it at all.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
And yeah, in terms of,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
it's definitely something we'd like.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
I'm not sure of initiatives going on there,

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
and we do, not last my train of thought, but yeah.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Thank you very much.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Unfortunately, this last question we have time off.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Please put the rest in the matrix room.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Thank you.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Well done.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
These are my notes.

27:41.000 --> 27:50.000
All right.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I think we got 100% of them.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
That's what this came to, like 100%.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
It's like fraction, like, oh god,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I've been thinking to mom,

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
and she's going to make sure I'm raising my phone.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
No, no.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Obviously you're live.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It connects.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
You have an adapter?

28:20.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
Let's see me if it's on.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
Why does it work?

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Turn on your second screen.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
It's not on, I think.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
It's difficult.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
It's difficult.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
So why does it not see it?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Basically, we're asking about

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
the current working part,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
where thousands have been located

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
into that satisfied party.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
So it's conducted where,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
for example, ISPs aren't that trustworthy,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
like you had probably the first one.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Well, it makes more sense,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
whereas in Lebanon,

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
I think it would be very difficult.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Yes, I can see you made it through.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
I get to try them all.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
It's a different department.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I'm sorry, I'm loud,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
but if I don't see them,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
it's got to be there,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
so it doesn't go through.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
Yes, it's coming.

30:04.000 --> 30:14.000
Yes.
