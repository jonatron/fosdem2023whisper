00:00.000 --> 00:11.120
Bitcoin sometimes referred to as magic internet money.

00:11.120 --> 00:15.120
It's currently the 15th largest currency in the world.

00:15.120 --> 00:21.760
We feel that Bitcoin embodies a lot of the open source ethics such as open collaboration

00:21.760 --> 00:24.480
and decentralization.

00:24.480 --> 00:31.360
In the last two years, 2021 and 2022, two of my colleagues have also been here speaking

00:31.360 --> 00:33.800
at FOSDEM.

00:33.800 --> 00:40.280
So I'm very grateful to be here waving the Bitcoin design community flag.

00:40.280 --> 00:45.000
Speaking of the Bitcoin design community, it is pretty young.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.640
It's just two and a half years old.

00:47.640 --> 00:52.840
The mission of the community is to improve the global adoption of Bitcoin.

00:52.840 --> 00:57.760
And that's only possible if we all openly collaborate and work together.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.280
The community basically acts as an online space.

01:01.280 --> 01:07.400
When I say online space, I'm talking about a Slack channel, simple as that.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.400
It's an online community.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.840
There's a whole hub of different projects in that community.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.640
There's even open source projects who just have their own Slack channel.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.960
So they choose to be in that Slack channel and work totally out in the open.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.880
They ask questions.

01:22.880 --> 01:31.480
It's a hive of very busy, active projects all working synchronously and asynchronously.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.520
I will share a little bit of stats about the community.

01:34.520 --> 01:38.520
So we have just over 3,000 Slack members.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.160
We have a couple thousand Twitter followers.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.280
There's a lot of devs in this room.

01:42.280 --> 01:46.720
So when I say close pull requests, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.080
We complete a lot of calls.

01:48.080 --> 01:53.760
So as I say, a big goal of the community is to help other open source projects.

01:53.760 --> 02:00.920
So we jump on calls with projects who would like to improve their user experience.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.520
And we assist them.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.760
So that's why there's that many calls.

02:05.760 --> 02:12.440
As you can see, not all of the calls are recorded because we have 174 completed calls and 103

02:12.440 --> 02:15.240
YouTube videos.

02:15.240 --> 02:20.320
Then we have a newsletter and we work with basically, there's a lot of project collaborations

02:20.320 --> 02:21.600
that we work with.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.080
So we've worked with Stratum.

02:23.080 --> 02:27.640
I don't know if some of you have heard of Bitcoin Core, as well as Wallet's Trutony

02:27.640 --> 02:29.280
and Blixt.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.640
Any of you heard of any of these projects?

02:31.640 --> 02:32.640
Cool.

02:32.640 --> 02:37.040
Bitcoin Core, nice.

02:37.040 --> 02:42.920
So I'll share a little bit about my background.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.360
Many many years ago, I worked as a marketing consultant.

02:47.360 --> 02:55.560
And the reason I worked in marketing was I had a passion for business and strategy and

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
those kinds of things.

02:56.560 --> 03:01.960
But the area in marketing that interested me the most was actually the research part.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.920
And why it actually interested me is because I was always interested in figuring out why

03:06.920 --> 03:08.920
things work the way they did.

03:08.920 --> 03:14.520
I was always interested in getting down to the nitty-gritty truth about things.

03:14.520 --> 03:18.760
And I have a feeling that there's a couple of people in this room that kind of share

03:18.760 --> 03:22.440
that insight, just raise of hands.

03:22.440 --> 03:27.920
Yeah, there's a natural researcher in a couple of us.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.400
So I specialized as a marketing researcher.

03:31.400 --> 03:35.480
And during that time, I pretty much worked as a consultant.

03:35.480 --> 03:40.240
So I worked as a consultant for basically like small and medium-sized businesses, helping

03:40.240 --> 03:48.160
them to devise strategies based on the research that I conducted.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.000
How did I stumble upon UX design?

03:51.000 --> 03:57.840
I was always fascinated with tech and I was losing the challenge in working as a marketing

03:57.840 --> 03:58.840
consultant.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.720
It was just the challenge that was missing.

04:00.720 --> 04:05.600
So I decided just to go ahead, there's that accessibility.

04:05.600 --> 04:12.480
Yeah, that would look cool.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.200
No, no, it's good.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.520
So I decided to start studying something else.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.920
And I came across UX design.

04:20.920 --> 04:25.840
And UX design for me was an intersection of three things that I was really passionate

04:25.840 --> 04:26.840
about.

04:26.840 --> 04:31.400
One was the intersection of design, psychology, and research all in one.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.680
These were things that I already enjoyed and I was already doing.

04:34.680 --> 04:41.480
So it was a perfect opportunity to combine all of them.

04:41.480 --> 04:47.000
Then I stumbled upon the Bitcoin design community.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.200
Here is a screenshot.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.960
This was just taken last night.

04:50.960 --> 04:57.080
So the community is basically, as I mentioned, it's this hub, it's very free, very open

04:57.080 --> 05:00.200
communication, very relaxed.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.400
And in the community, there are all these different projects that are working out in

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
the open.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
They're all open source projects.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.240
Bitcoin Core is one of them.

05:10.240 --> 05:15.600
So I started basically volunteering at this community, as in jobless volunteering, you

05:15.600 --> 05:19.560
know, because I was passionate about working in Bitcoin.

05:19.560 --> 05:23.600
So I started volunteering, I was just having a whole bunch of fun, jumping on all these

05:23.600 --> 05:25.400
different calls.

05:25.400 --> 05:32.680
And then one day, someone came knocking at my door and said, hey, Mo, like, you know,

05:32.680 --> 05:35.640
you're doing some pretty good work here in the community.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.640
Why don't you, you know, be a UX researcher?

05:38.640 --> 05:46.760
And I was like, like me, you know, there was like imposter syndrome came in from all sorts

05:46.760 --> 05:48.040
of different directions.

05:48.040 --> 05:52.920
I know everyone here has dealt one time with the post syndrome, but it came in from all

05:52.920 --> 05:54.600
sorts of different directions.

05:54.600 --> 05:59.240
The first challenge was the technical challenge, because particularly in the industry that

05:59.240 --> 06:06.640
I work in, the technical know-how is extremely, it's extremely high because of all the terminology,

06:06.640 --> 06:09.400
you know, I work in Bitcoin and I work in Lightning.

06:09.400 --> 06:15.240
So there's a lot of what I would use the term gibberish, which now to me doesn't sound

06:15.240 --> 06:19.640
like gibberish anymore, it makes sense.

06:19.640 --> 06:24.760
So then I started to find some direction.

06:24.760 --> 06:29.800
I met Christoph Onno, who works in the Bitcoin design community.

06:29.800 --> 06:35.560
And he basically said, Mo, why don't you be an evangelist for UX research in the Bitcoin

06:35.560 --> 06:37.440
design community?

06:37.440 --> 06:40.240
Why don't you wave the research flag?

06:40.240 --> 06:43.560
So I said, okay, you know, why not?

06:43.560 --> 06:44.920
Let's give it a shot.

06:44.920 --> 06:52.000
And he then basically suggested to me to create a UX research toolkit for the entire ecosystem

06:52.000 --> 06:58.520
to use so that if they didn't have a UX researcher on their team, they could basically dive into

06:58.520 --> 07:09.320
the toolkit, grab a tool that they felt would be useful and start using it.

07:09.320 --> 07:15.520
And so I started building.

07:15.520 --> 07:22.200
So my goal was to develop this UX research toolkit, which would basically help projects

07:22.200 --> 07:28.160
in open source to feedback insights and data and knowledge back into their projects so

07:28.160 --> 07:35.480
that they could develop more human centric products.

07:35.480 --> 07:40.760
But of course, there were some challenges along the way.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.920
There were two very big challenges that I faced.

07:44.920 --> 07:51.240
Within the industry that I work in, UX research is still very much at its infancy.

07:51.240 --> 07:59.160
So building the kit, a big part of my role is getting people to understand the benefits

07:59.160 --> 08:00.920
of UX research.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.360
So that was the first biggest challenge.

08:03.360 --> 08:07.520
The second biggest challenge was no such toolkit actually existed.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.980
So there are UX research toolkits on the market.

08:10.980 --> 08:15.560
If you go into Figma community and you type in UX research, there are toolkits that exist

08:15.560 --> 08:20.800
on the market for UX research, but not specifically for the industry that I worked in.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.360
So there I was building this kit.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.600
And if I look to the left, hey, can you help me with some advice?

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
There's no one there.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.680
If I look to the right, there's also no one there.

08:29.680 --> 08:34.640
So I started building this kit purely based on the projects that I was working with within

08:34.640 --> 08:37.680
the community.

08:37.680 --> 08:41.400
And so I needed to get very hands on.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.280
It's nice to see that we have someone from Bitcoin Core here in the room, because one

08:45.280 --> 08:48.720
of the projects that I work on is Bitcoin Core.

08:48.720 --> 08:53.220
I've also worked with the Galois team, and I've also worked on the Blexed Wallet.

08:53.220 --> 08:59.000
So what I actually did was I basically just wave my hands, sent out a Slack message to

08:59.000 --> 09:01.440
these different people in the community.

09:01.440 --> 09:06.840
And I said, hey, can I come jump in and can I come talk to you about UX research?

09:06.840 --> 09:12.200
So I started jumping on these calls and working with these projects, I started to really get

09:12.200 --> 09:18.560
a good feel of what do they need, what kind of insights do they need to be able to build

09:18.560 --> 09:20.280
more human-centric products.

09:20.280 --> 09:26.200
So I started to build the kit from a place of real hands on experience with different

09:26.200 --> 09:32.620
projects.

09:32.620 --> 09:36.480
But of course, I was working in a silo.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.880
So this is showing the messiness of it.

09:39.880 --> 09:48.280
First started designing different resources, different tools, working in Google documents.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.800
There were files everywhere.

09:50.800 --> 09:56.480
You know, I call it like, I don't even know what you call it, you're smiling, probably

09:56.480 --> 10:02.760
you recognize this, there were files everywhere on different platforms.

10:02.760 --> 10:09.280
And I was working in a silo, as I said, because while I had my feet in these projects, I still

10:09.280 --> 10:13.440
was working alone as a UX researcher.

10:13.440 --> 10:19.800
So the first iteration of the UX research toolkit, it was just like, hey, these are

10:19.800 --> 10:23.640
all the different types of UX research tools and methods that are available.

10:23.640 --> 10:28.300
Here they are, I'll design tools and resources for every single thing that's available.

10:28.300 --> 10:34.520
So I went in with that, I would call it naivety.

10:34.520 --> 10:38.080
And then something really interesting happened.

10:38.080 --> 10:45.120
I started to really embody the ethos of working in public.

10:45.120 --> 10:48.720
And I was just speaking with another UX researcher about that.

10:48.720 --> 10:53.520
And the ethos of working in public is basically sharing all of your work out in the public

10:53.520 --> 10:55.840
even when it's messy.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.880
Yeah, you do the same, I guess.

10:59.880 --> 11:05.240
So it's, you know, I don't, when I share my research or what I'm doing in my research,

11:05.240 --> 11:07.600
I don't share the final presentation.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.960
I share the messy parts.

11:08.960 --> 11:14.840
I share the Google document with the UX research strategy that's half finished.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.280
I'm still building the strategy.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.960
Have a look everyone.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.000
Do you have anything to contribute?

11:20.000 --> 11:24.880
So this is what I started doing and as a result of sharing my work on Twitter, on LinkedIn,

11:24.880 --> 11:30.680
and being very public, open, and transparent, people started reaching out to me.

11:30.680 --> 11:34.720
Fellow UX researchers, they started reaching out and they started saying, hey, you're building

11:34.720 --> 11:37.800
something, it looks interesting, could you tell us more about it?

11:37.800 --> 11:45.600
So I started inviting them onto my calls and I actually invited them to build with me together.

11:45.600 --> 11:51.720
And then we, so the picture here, the picture's not here.

11:51.720 --> 11:55.440
I added in a picture, one of the slides, maybe it comes up later on, but there's a picture

11:55.440 --> 12:00.940
of a whole bunch of us on the call together, but basically different UX researchers from

12:00.940 --> 12:05.080
different industries, not only the industry that I work in, they started to jump on these

12:05.080 --> 12:10.360
calls and we actually started to together brainstorm and ideate.

12:10.360 --> 12:14.640
We were like, okay, there's a whole spectrum of UX research tools that are available, but

12:14.640 --> 12:18.720
what in your experience has been the tools that I've worked the best for the projects

12:18.720 --> 12:20.400
that you've worked on?

12:20.400 --> 12:24.000
So we did it with pure democracy, pure voting.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.520
We just jammed together and we voted, we voted on which tools we felt would be the best.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.440
And that's how this toolkit, these tools were basically chosen.

12:33.440 --> 12:40.080
Right now we're still building out this first half and actually a week, no, next week Tuesday

12:40.080 --> 12:45.060
we have a meeting to discuss which will be the other half of the research toolkit because

12:45.060 --> 12:47.520
version one's pretty much been decided on.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.840
It's been split out into two halves.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.040
So one half is scope and build out.

12:53.040 --> 12:57.320
So this is if you have no product and you're looking to build from scratch and you want

12:57.320 --> 12:59.720
to build the product from scratch, you have nothing.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.200
You start from zero.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.720
And the other part is shipping the product to market.

13:03.720 --> 13:07.560
So you already have a product, but you need to iterate on the product because you've been

13:07.560 --> 13:09.520
getting a lot of user feedback.

13:09.520 --> 13:15.080
So in our opinion, and this is just guidance and advice, we would say, hey, these might

13:15.080 --> 13:19.080
be the tools you can use if you already have a product.

13:19.080 --> 13:23.120
And these might be the tools that you can use if you're starting out from a new product.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.760
But these are not hard and fast rules.

13:25.760 --> 13:29.480
You know, they're totally open to you and your team and the resources and the time

13:29.480 --> 13:33.360
that you have available.

13:33.360 --> 13:38.600
And of course, because we're researchers, we absolutely wouldn't do it right if we

13:38.600 --> 13:40.800
didn't collect feedback.

13:40.800 --> 13:46.320
So we ran a UX research test on our UX research tool kit.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.800
That was super fun to tweet about.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.400
We had so much fun with that.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.960
And we got feedback about our kit.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.760
So that was a lot of fun.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.200
And so we iterated on the kit.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.680
So what I'm busy doing at the moment now is we've collected all of the UX research and

13:59.680 --> 14:05.200
the feedback from the kit, and we're now iterating on it and making changes.

14:05.200 --> 14:10.440
Just learned a very quick one, Pivot.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.200
Pivot and turn if you think that is better for the user experience.

14:14.200 --> 14:19.280
So basically, I was developing this kit, working in the silo.

14:19.280 --> 14:24.320
And as a result of realizing that the way I was delivering my product was not going

14:24.320 --> 14:32.600
to be usable for the people I intended it to be used by, I literally did a 180 pivot

14:32.600 --> 14:34.880
within a really short space of time.

14:34.880 --> 14:35.880
And I did it in public.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.840
I was like, hey, guys, no, this is not going to deliver the right user experience.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.680
So I pivoted.

14:41.680 --> 14:49.560
So the second thing is that building in silo, it's nice to build in silo if it suits your

14:49.560 --> 14:50.960
personality type.

14:50.960 --> 14:56.560
But if you build as a team and you invite the entire ecosystem to build with you, you

14:56.560 --> 15:00.360
get the insights, the knowledge, and the intelligence of everyone else.

15:00.360 --> 15:04.280
And you get to learn from everyone else as well.

15:04.280 --> 15:11.040
And the last insight is UX research is as much about communication as it is data.

15:11.040 --> 15:17.800
If we would like the developers and the UX designers to take the feedback from our research

15:17.800 --> 15:23.920
on board, we need to learn how to communicate it in a good way and in a visual way.

15:23.920 --> 15:30.280
One of the things that I do is when I feedback my UX research insights to the team, I tend

15:30.280 --> 15:32.560
to not feedback solutions.

15:32.560 --> 15:37.280
Then I place the trust and the intelligence in the hands of the team.

15:37.280 --> 15:41.280
And I say to them, listen, guys, this is an insight from a user.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.920
They said they don't understand what this button means.

15:43.920 --> 15:49.960
And then I asked the developers and I asked the UX designers, how can we solve this problem?

15:49.960 --> 15:55.600
So it invites a very open conversation for everyone to come up with a solution together

15:55.600 --> 16:00.160
as opposed to one person coming up with a solution.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.800
That's it for me.

16:01.800 --> 16:08.800
If you can find me on Twitter, Mogesh and I do.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.800
Are there any questions?

16:11.800 --> 16:12.800
Shoot.

16:12.800 --> 16:13.800
Thank you.

16:13.800 --> 16:22.800
How do your research methods differ across user types, contributors, teaming, node operators,

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
contributors?

16:23.800 --> 16:24.800
Could you repeat that, please?

16:24.800 --> 16:31.800
How do your research methods differ across user types, like from node operators, contributors,

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
and end users?

16:32.800 --> 16:33.800
Node operators, users?

16:33.800 --> 16:34.800
End users?

16:34.800 --> 16:35.800
Yeah.

16:35.800 --> 16:36.800
And people contribute to the protocol.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.800
Can you repeat the question?

16:37.800 --> 16:38.800
Yeah, it's just, it's, it's.

16:38.800 --> 16:39.800
Am I really quiet?

16:39.800 --> 16:40.800
Okay.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.800
So you know there's different personas that participate in a network.

16:41.800 --> 16:55.800
There's people who might contribute to the network and like open a PR, and then there's

16:55.800 --> 17:05.800
people who are end users and adopt the product, and then there's people who have to run the

17:05.800 --> 17:06.800
client.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.800
How do you use different research methods to get feedback from all the people?

17:07.800 --> 17:12.800
Do you more referring to the fact that the user feedback is kind of spread across like

17:12.800 --> 17:16.800
GitHub issues to Twitter?

17:16.800 --> 17:20.800
Is that kind of the, the data is kind of spread across different sources?

17:20.800 --> 17:28.800
That's probably about classifying your users into different groups based on their tasks

17:28.800 --> 17:30.800
or your scenario.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.800
This would be more referring to, and that's a slide there.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.800
It would be jobs to be done.

17:35.800 --> 17:40.800
So I'll speak about jobs to be done very briefly.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.800
So Blockstream has kind of, you know, popped in the community every now and then.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.800
We've also had some node management platforms also jumping in lightning node management

17:48.800 --> 17:51.800
platforms, jumping into the platform is community as well.

17:51.800 --> 17:57.800
And they're really moving towards trying to understand the jobs or the tasks that the

17:57.800 --> 18:04.800
interface needs to be able to do to satisfy or make the particular user groups happy.

18:04.800 --> 18:09.800
So how they start this process is phase one is who are the different personas that we're

18:09.800 --> 18:10.800
designing for.

18:10.800 --> 18:15.800
So you could do a persona exercise and identify these different personas by doing

18:15.800 --> 18:18.800
ethnographic research, user interviews.

18:18.800 --> 18:24.800
But you could also do a jobs to be done, which is basically jumping, having a rough idea

18:24.800 --> 18:29.800
of who you think these user groups are, and then having a very umbrella like conversation

18:29.800 --> 18:34.800
with them and asking them what they need from the interface.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.800
Does that answer your question?

18:36.800 --> 18:39.800
Yeah.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.800
So great talk.

18:41.800 --> 18:42.800
Really interesting.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.800
So thank you for giving it.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.800
So I'm not a designer, but I'm a social scientist.

18:47.800 --> 18:52.800
And I really like this idea of toolkits because methodologically in the social

18:52.800 --> 18:58.800
science we do oftentimes a lot of things that research focused designers do.

18:58.800 --> 19:04.800
And so in my experience, when finding correct tools to do things, it's like within the

19:04.800 --> 19:06.800
social science, it's like you got to read a book.

19:06.800 --> 19:11.800
So I published a book 20 years ago and it's got some ideas in there.

19:11.800 --> 19:16.800
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you got this community

19:16.800 --> 19:21.800
together to put together, decide what tools go into the toolkit.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.800
How did you do that outreach?

19:23.800 --> 19:25.800
And I know you spoke a little bit.

19:25.800 --> 19:29.800
I'm like voting on various things, but I was wondering if you could just give a little

19:29.800 --> 19:30.800
bit more detail.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.800
Yeah, absolutely.

19:31.800 --> 19:35.800
So as I mentioned, when I started creating and feel free to stop me when the time is

19:35.800 --> 19:39.800
up, but as I mentioned, I basically, when I started, I started really umbrella and I

19:39.800 --> 19:43.800
started just thinking, oh, I'll just start creating tools for every, all the different

19:43.800 --> 19:45.800
UX research tools that I know about.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.800
Basically, we at the community, we have calls.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.800
The calls are all open for everyone to watch on YouTube.

19:52.800 --> 19:57.800
Probably if you go on YouTube, you type in UX research calls, Bitcoin design community,

19:57.800 --> 19:59.800
you'll find the call where we voted.

19:59.800 --> 20:05.800
So we basically had four UX researchers, everyone from different backgrounds.

20:05.800 --> 20:12.800
First, we opened up with a conversation of, hey, how do we split the toolkit?

20:12.800 --> 20:14.800
What would be the most sensical way of splitting the toolkit?

20:14.800 --> 20:16.800
That was the question number one.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.800
Then we decided on the two areas.

20:19.800 --> 20:26.800
And then question number two was, in your experience, what has worked the best with understanding

20:26.800 --> 20:29.800
and gaining insights at this phase of the product?

20:29.800 --> 20:33.800
What helps to understand and get insights at that phase of the product?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.800
And then we just jammed.

20:35.800 --> 20:40.800
Like everyone was, we wrote, we made a few sticky notes and then we voted literally with

20:40.800 --> 20:45.800
smiley faces and we didn't even share, there were no names attached to smiley faces.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.800
So it was really open and transparent.

20:49.800 --> 20:55.800
And yeah, I mean, if there's any UX researchers in this room, I openly invite you.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.800
And I know there's already one in this room.

20:58.800 --> 21:04.800
I openly invite you to come work on the UX research toolkit because it's completely open for everyone.

21:04.800 --> 21:12.800
I want more minds and more insights on it because I believe we can only build better products if we build together.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.800
That's the selection.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.800
Yeah, you can find me on Twitter.

21:16.800 --> 21:22.800
If you reach out to me on Twitter, I'll direct you to the Slack channel and we can, yeah.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.800
Thanks for the great presentation.

21:24.800 --> 21:29.800
I'm really curious now that you're working on this research toolkit and you want to take it somewhere,

21:29.800 --> 21:30.800
what is the next step?

21:30.800 --> 21:34.800
How do you make sure that the people that you want to reach with it can actually start using it?

21:34.800 --> 21:35.800
I already have an idea about that.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.800
I love that question.

21:37.800 --> 21:41.800
So my next dream, and I think I have to stop now and I'll wrap it up very quickly,

21:41.800 --> 21:47.800
is that my next goal is once the toolkit's built out, I'm going to reach out to all the open source projects.

21:47.800 --> 21:51.800
I'm going to go knocking at everyone's door and say, hey, can you come help me test out this toolkit?

21:51.800 --> 21:52.800
Can we run it through?

21:52.800 --> 21:54.800
Can we do a bit of a sprint in your project?

21:54.800 --> 22:02.800
And then I'd like to get feedback from them and see how they experience it and then build case studies out of that feedback

22:02.800 --> 22:06.800
and then show other projects like, hey, Bitcoin Core used the toolkit.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.800
Look, this is how it worked for them.

22:07.800 --> 22:13.800
This is the case study and then use that as a way to basically move forward.

22:13.800 --> 22:14.800
Cool.

22:14.800 --> 22:38.800
Thank you, everyone.
