[00:00.000 --> 00:13.520]  We welcome Bertrand, he will explain us how he's in the Open Transport Committee since
[00:13.520 --> 00:17.680]  10 years on what is his journey.
[00:17.680 --> 00:19.960]  Thanks a lot.
[00:19.960 --> 00:22.160]  So do you hear me?
[00:22.160 --> 00:23.520]  It's okay.
[00:23.520 --> 00:30.480]  So I'm not a technical guy so I want to talk a lot about technical stuff.
[00:30.480 --> 00:37.760]  So I was working first at a digital subsidiary called CanalTP, then Kizio Digital and then
[00:37.760 --> 00:46.640]  OV and it was a digital subsidiary of Keolis and Keolis is a subsidiary of Essencef Group.
[00:46.640 --> 00:57.160]  So I'm part of this great organization and we did an open source software called Navicia.
[00:57.160 --> 01:06.760]  I think maybe some people know who knows Navicia, okay, less than OpenTrip planner, hi Volker.
[01:06.760 --> 01:13.600]  So next presentation, Volker will talk about Navicia because he's using Navicia on KDE
[01:13.600 --> 01:14.600]  itinerary.
[01:14.600 --> 01:23.040]  Well, now I'm working more on open data but what is important for me is to connect the
[01:23.040 --> 01:30.400]  vision, the ambition of the CEO of Essencef, Jean-Pierre Ferrandou, because he wants to
[01:30.400 --> 01:41.280]  double the rail share in the mobility mix up to the 15 next year or 10 next year to
[01:41.280 --> 01:46.840]  decarbonize our trips and ensure a more sustainable and inclusive mobility.
[01:46.840 --> 01:55.240]  And for me, open source, open data commons are very important to do this job quickly,
[01:55.240 --> 02:04.320]  easier because if data, if digital resources are more open, they are more useful, usable
[02:04.320 --> 02:06.800]  and used.
[02:06.800 --> 02:16.640]  So 10 years ago, I didn't know how it worked, it began with a little hack when I was at
[02:16.640 --> 02:20.920]  OV CanalTP with Navicia.
[02:20.920 --> 02:34.080]  It was the first, well, proprietary software for 10 years and some developers decided to
[02:34.080 --> 02:44.760]  do an API because they were, they attended a lot of hackathons, challenges, events with
[02:44.760 --> 02:51.120]  open street maps also and they wanted to share what they did with other developers.
[02:51.120 --> 03:00.360]  And so they did this API but it was a hack because the directors of the firm don't know
[03:00.360 --> 03:01.760]  about that.
[03:01.760 --> 03:10.200]  And we saw that a lot of people used it because it was useful and it was less time for them
[03:10.200 --> 03:15.720]  to invent other things.
[03:15.720 --> 03:22.360]  And it begins like this and with some guys, with some developers and then we decided to
[03:22.360 --> 03:31.240]  open the software because there was the open API, there was the open data sets and now we
[03:31.240 --> 03:38.640]  decided to open the software because we are part of a public transport group and we are
[03:38.640 --> 03:40.880]  paid with public money also.
[03:40.880 --> 03:47.960]  So we thought that was normal to have public code and for general interest, for digital
[03:47.960 --> 03:51.640]  sovereignty empowerment, it was very important to do that.
[03:51.640 --> 03:59.320]  And so we opened the source code of Navicia and with the API too.
[03:59.320 --> 04:07.120]  And we did a little work, so what was the benefits about the open source project?
[04:07.120 --> 04:16.720]  We contribute to a book called Open Models about all these ideas that was good for us
[04:16.720 --> 04:19.840]  and for the community.
[04:19.840 --> 04:27.320]  And then we decided to build some, well, there was the software with the documentation
[04:27.320 --> 04:35.360]  but there was the API also and what we call the open data bar because we needed a lot
[04:35.360 --> 04:41.760]  of open data sets from different countries, from France, from Germany, from mostly in
[04:41.760 --> 04:50.120]  Europe and we did data cleansing on these data sets so that was easier for developers
[04:50.120 --> 04:54.680]  to reuse the data.
[04:54.680 --> 05:00.160]  And with this API, we did a lot of different tools.
[05:00.160 --> 05:06.600]  For example, so that's the repository on GitHub.
[05:06.600 --> 05:16.920]  And we did, for example, also a documentation with example and tips.
[05:16.920 --> 05:25.000]  We also, we did also a forum, a chat for developers because it was very important to
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.320]  connect with the community.
[05:27.320 --> 05:36.480]  So we did also the Navicia Playground, it's an API console also to save time for developers
[05:36.480 --> 05:46.320]  and then we did also mobile SDK for mobile application to simplify the work for developers.
[05:46.320 --> 05:53.400]  But one of my job that was very important, it was to organize different events.
[05:53.400 --> 06:01.640]  The first one was what we call the open routing workshop with 10 or 15 guys, a guy from OTP
[06:01.640 --> 06:15.920]  for example and we worked on the topics all together and then I initiated the Navicia meet-up
[06:16.520 --> 06:24.720]  to talk with re-users of Navicia and I decided to change the Navicia meet-up and call it
[06:24.720 --> 06:30.800]  open transport meet-up that was more general with more different people, more different
[06:30.800 --> 06:39.800]  topics, not only in Navicia because when you talk about ecosystem, it's better to have
[06:39.800 --> 06:41.840]  a generic word.
[06:41.840 --> 06:51.960]  So this word was used by Peter Colpaert in Belgium some years ago, there was a mailing
[06:51.960 --> 06:58.720]  list, open transport mailing list and I decided to use it also for the meet-up and I decided
[06:58.720 --> 07:04.280]  to organize different meet-ups in Paris first and then over French cities, even in Belgium,
[07:04.280 --> 07:10.560]  in London also, Brussels and London and that's very interesting because now in Germany they
[07:10.560 --> 07:15.120]  organize their own open transport meet-up also.
[07:15.120 --> 07:26.800]  So for me it's important to share all these ideas in most countries with different people
[07:26.800 --> 07:33.200]  so if you want to have the same initiative in Finland or other countries, don't hesitate
[07:33.200 --> 07:35.840]  to talk to me.
[07:35.840 --> 07:42.840]  So thanks a lot, if you have any questions, it was a very start.
[07:42.840 --> 07:51.840]  So in your experience, what has been a successful way of making private companies cooperate
[07:51.840 --> 07:56.840]  when providing open data?
[07:57.840 --> 08:05.840]  We know state-operated companies, they usually end up publishing information in the open
[08:05.840 --> 08:18.840]  but then you have companies like Lyft or Burt or any of the free-floating services.
[08:19.840 --> 08:26.840]  What is the strategy that you follow?
[08:26.840 --> 08:42.840]  For example, we worked with a GAFAM and they wanted to use data sets in Paris, Paris
[08:43.840 --> 08:49.840]  and we decided to use the open data sets that was the ODBL license.
[08:49.840 --> 08:57.840]  So we convinced them that the work we will do for them will be also in open data.
[08:57.840 --> 09:03.840]  So as everybody could reuse the same data quality than them.
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.840]  So for me that's very important because it means you can work with private companies,
[09:09.840 --> 09:20.840]  you can have bargaining power even if you are a small firm with only maybe less than 100 guys.
[09:20.840 --> 09:27.840]  But if you explain the things and if the benefits are important for them,
[09:27.840 --> 09:35.840]  they can change the mind about open data or not and so that's very important.
[09:35.840 --> 09:41.840]  It's difficult because sometimes these companies are most based in the US
[09:41.840 --> 09:50.840]  because in France most of the times there are only sales but not the guys who decide these kind of things.
[09:53.840 --> 10:02.840]  It's good for me this talk because I have a friend who has a very bad experience with SNCF
[10:02.840 --> 10:09.840]  and new bicycle so to go to the west coast of the sea in France.
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.840]  So because they had no the right information partly in the information of the public,
[10:15.840 --> 10:17.840]  like the French.
[10:17.840 --> 10:25.840]  So it has a bad connection information between national train information
[10:25.840 --> 10:30.840]  and they have only the information for the original train
[10:30.840 --> 10:34.840]  and how to go to another region with another plane,
[10:34.840 --> 10:39.840]  I speak plane, I teach in B and so on.
[10:39.840 --> 10:48.840]  So I think it's important also that the public information is also good for the people working there.
[10:48.840 --> 10:55.840]  They work on national coverage because it would be easier from this kind of problem
[10:55.840 --> 11:01.840]  you could have in France because you have different regions with different information systems
[11:01.840 --> 11:07.840]  and so sometimes it's complicated if you go from one region to another one.
[11:07.840 --> 11:14.840]  The information is not so easy sometimes.
[11:15.840 --> 11:17.840]  It's very short.
[11:17.840 --> 11:23.840]  What could you do in the situation where a government, one entity doesn't want to publish a book later
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.840]  because this is such a very common occurrence in Romania.
[11:28.840 --> 11:31.840]  In Romania?
[11:31.840 --> 11:34.840]  They are not in Europe?
[11:34.840 --> 11:36.840]  Yes.
[11:36.840 --> 11:45.840]  I think it's complicated because to comply with regulations they publish it once a year.
[11:45.840 --> 11:49.840]  It's very out there but it's still complied.
[11:49.840 --> 11:52.840]  There is a similar thing in Brussels.
[11:52.840 --> 11:58.840]  To comply and publish the type-tapers, the real time that is not published against the company
[11:58.840 --> 12:02.840]  has appeared to lose contact with its customers.
[12:02.840 --> 12:06.840]  No, they have a direct contact because they have the app
[12:06.840 --> 12:12.840]  and they say if we publish everything people won't use our app because it may be not the best.
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.840]  Our customers adore and they don't want that.
[12:17.840 --> 12:20.840]  Can you convince them?
[12:20.840 --> 12:25.840]  What I saw is that when technical guys are talking with technical guys
[12:25.840 --> 12:30.840]  it's better than when top managers are talking together.
[12:30.840 --> 12:38.840]  The best is when technical guys work together.
[12:38.840 --> 12:46.840]  Even if the top managers maybe sometimes don't know it.
[12:46.840 --> 12:49.840]  It's a struggle.
[12:49.840 --> 12:51.840]  Thank you.
[13:00.840 --> 13:02.840]  Thank you.
