The speaker, Sergei Alvarez, also known as Pancake, gave a talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 about his project called R2. R2 is an open source forensic tool that he developed to recover files from hard drives. He created R2 because he found that existing tools didn't solve his problems, such as the inability to script GDB and the lack of extensibility in existing tools. R2 is a standalone tool that doesn't rely on any dependencies and can be run on various platforms, including WebAssembly and routers. The project has been developed for 17 years and is focused on being useful for hackers. Sergei discussed the different libraries in the R2 ecosystem, including IO, Assembler, Disassembler, Debugging, and File Systems. He also talked about the various plugins that have been developed for R2, including R2-Dec, R2-Gidra, R2-Reddeck, R2-Frida, and more. R2-Frida is a front-end for the Frida tool, which allows for dynamic instrumentation of remote processes. Sergei also talked about R2-Pipe, a runtime interface for scripting R2 with various languages such as JavaScript, Python, Rust, and more. The future plans for R2 include maintaining ABBA stability, reducing technical depth, improving code coverage and testing, and creating a Rust API for static linking of R2.
