In this talk, Boris and Redon discussed how organizations, teams, and individuals can break away from Big Tech by leveraging open source infrastructure. They proposed several possible approaches that could be suitable for various types of users, such as hosting their own services, using no-code platforms, building an internal team, hosting collective services, and engaging managed service providers. Each option had its positives and negatives and it was stressed that it was important to keep in mind not to be locked into a single vendor and to read terms and conditions.
