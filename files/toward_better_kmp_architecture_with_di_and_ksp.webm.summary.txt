 All right. That's it. Thank you everybody.

In this talk, Romain Boacelle discussed using Kotlin Symbol Processor (KSP) to improve the use of Codeine and the dependency injection library. He introduced the @result annotation to detect and generate code for the DI container and the DI resolver interface to generate the check function for a dependency container's consistency. He also proposed a new approach to improve the type API in the code in DSL and a few ideas to solve corner cases.
