{"text": " Here today at Bosdem, I am going to be talking about contributor growth strategies, how to get more contributors for your open source project. Today I'll start by talking about the factors that can impact contributor growth and why it can be so incredibly challenging before moving into some strategies for growing your contributor base using contributor ladders to help people move into leadership positions. And then finally I'll talk about some metrics you can use to measure project sustainability and then we'll look at a few resources and give you some final thoughts. First I'll tell you a teeny tiny bit about me. I've been in the technology industry for well over 20 years working mostly on open source projects from within companies like Intel, Puppet, and now at VMware I'm responsible for our open source community strategy within the open source program office. I'm a board member of Open UK, I'm a governing board member and maintainer for the Linux Foundation's Chaos Metrics project, I'm co-chair of the CNCF contributor strategy technical advisory group and I also have a PhD from the University of Greenwich where I researched how people collaborate within the Linux kernel. Let's start by talking more about why it can be so hard to achieve contributor growth. In this section we'll talk about some of the issues people face that can impact the sustainability of contributions along with the vicious cycle that people often face when trying to balance the time required to maintain the project versus the time to onboard new contributors. The reality is we are not mindless automatons. We have feelings, we have bad days, we have other commitments and personal challenges in our lives that are often invisible to the other contributors within the project and they can get in the way of our contributions to open source projects. We can be squishy, we can be unpredictable and irrational, especially when we're stressed out, when we're overworked, when we're burnt out. But you can't have an open source project without actually having people to maintain it so you need to be able to encourage people to participate in ways that are sustainable not just for the project but also for those people as human beings. Many projects struggle to find people who will actively participate in their projects and continue to participate over the long term. If it was easy you would all have all of the people you needed to maintain your project and I'd be in an empty room and none of you would be watching this talk. But we're in a situation now where there are lots of open source projects and just frankly not enough contributors. Maintainers are burning out and are in desperate need of help. And sometimes it can be really difficult to get people to contribute to your project. And unfortunately there's no magic behind this, there's no one size fits all solution. But throughout this talk I will focus on some things that you can do to increase the chances of successfully building a community and then growing more contributors for your project. Maintaining an open source project is hard work. And it extends out over many years. And maintainer burnout is common within open source projects. Even the really big successful projects like Kubernetes struggle with maintainer burnout and growing the contributor community. It can be hard for already overworked maintainers to balance the day to day work required to keep the project running while also investing in additional activity to increase future community sustainability. So this creates a vicious cycle where maintainers don't have enough time to onboard new contributors leading to fewer contributors which leads back to no time to onboard new contributors. And while it takes a bit more time up front, if you can invest some time in activities that will help onboard new contributors like onboarding documentation for example, you can increase the chances that you can break out of this vicious cycle. Another way to free up some time for maintainers to break out of this cycle is by getting help for different types of contributions that take up valuable time and are required to make an open source project successful. So think about things like documentation, marketing, community management and loads of other things. And for projects with really complex code bases, it can sometimes be a lot easier to onboard people into some of these roles first to help free up some time to onboard other contributors later. Now next up, let's talk about developing and executing on a long term contributor growth strategy including motivation, governance, new contributor onboarding, mentoring and leadership. People's motivations for contributing to your project vary widely. Some people are contributing as part of their job while others might contribute to gain experience or maybe learn more about a particular technology. And you don't really have any control whatsoever over what motivated people to show up. But there are things that you can do to motivate them to stick around regardless of why they showed up in the first place. Clear communication and reducing friction are key to helping people stick around. And I'll talk more in upcoming slides about the importance of explicit and clearly communicated governance along with solid onboarding docs and fostering a welcoming and inclusive community. But there are other things you can do to help motivate people to contribute. Having good first issues or help wanted labels are excellent places to start because these help contributors find something that they can work on while they learn more about the project. So good first issues should be targeted as something very simple that a brand new contributor can just pick up and do in a very quick amount of time. It helps them learn more about the contribution process. And then help wanted labels are for issues that maybe are a little bit more complicated and take a little bit more time so that people who've already started to contribute can find something else to work on next. And good first issues and help wanted labels are passive requests for help, right? But I also encourage maintainers to be proactive and specific about ways that people can help. Asking someone specific to review a PR or maybe answer a question in Slack or some other forum from a user demonstrates that you recognize their expertise and that you want their help specifically. And going back to the discussion about squishy humans, knowing that we're appreciated makes us feel good, right? Which can be a strong motivator to participate in an open source project. Now I know a lot of people like to really hate on governance. It's just paperwork, it's busy work, nobody likes it, it's just gets in the way of doing the real work on the project. But this really isn't true of good governance. And good governance is really about setting expectations and getting all of the people in the community collaborating together. And ultimately the focus of open source project governance is on people. The roles we play, our responsibilities, how we make decisions, and what we should expect from each other as participating in the community. The goal should be to make the processes for participation as obvious as possible. Even for people who are brand new to the community. So having clear rules about how collaboration occurs, how decisions are made, and what types of contributions are in or out of scope really helps community members make contributions that are likely to be accepted and embraced by the project. This helps avoid wasting maintainers' time for contributions that just aren't aligned with the project at all. And a healthy project with clear governance makes contributors happy and helps set the project up for success and future growth. Now another aspect of governance is about making it easier for people to move into positions of increasing responsibility to help reduce the load on existing maintainers. We'll talk more about this later in the section about contributor ladders and leadership. But the good news is you don't have to start from scratch, right? We have some good templates with instructions that we've developed at the CNCF. But they apply to most projects so they can help you sort of quickly and easily build out some really basic governance for your project. Now I suspect that some of you are still thinking that you really don't need to spend time on governance. But think about this from the perspective of the new contributor. It's a lot more difficult to participate in a project or participate in a community if you don't know anything about the role that you might play, the expectations, the key players, or the roles for participating. So explicit documented governance gives new and existing contributors a clear path to guide them through your project. And spending a bit of time, you don't spend a lot but just a bit of time documenting governance up front can help save you time later with fewer questions about how things work. And it gives you a document that you can point people to if they have questions. Now when I start contributing to a new open source project, I want to know how decisions are made and who makes those decisions which helps me understand whether decisions are likely to be made fairly by people with the expertise to make those decisions. And I also want to see a clear path into leadership for me or for my colleagues if we decide to stick around in the project over the long term. But the bottom line is that if the process for collaboration and decision making are not clearly documented as part of the project governance, this introduces a lot of uncertainty and increases the barrier to contribution while also jeopardizing the long term health and viability of the project. I see so many open source projects with contributing guides that don't actually provide any useful information about contributing to the project. At a minimum, a new contributor needs to understand how to spin up an environment where they can do their development, the expectations for testing and how to run those tests, any processes or expectations you have around things like pull requests or issues, and instructions for other requirements like maybe they need to sign a CLA or sign their commits using the DCO process. Now if this is well documented, contributors can get started with a minimal amount of help from existing maintainers which can save you a lot of time in the long run. And when a project doesn't have good onboarding docs, maintainers can get frustrated by the amount of time they spend on new contributor questions and it can make it hard for contributors to feel welcome and take them longer to become productive. Now this does not mean that you need to spend days and days and weeks and weeks writing the perfect onboarding documentation for your project. Anything is better than nothing. And if you just start with a few things that can help people get started quickly, new contributors can actually help make the onboarding documents better by adding more details and additional instructions for things that they found confusing or that they had struggled with. Your project should also be designed to keep diversity, equity and inclusion top of mind. Building a diverse community where people feel welcome and included doesn't just happen, it does require putting at least some thought into it, but it's really time well spent. Building an environment where everyone, including people from marginalized populations feels safe is the first step toward building a diverse community for your project. Ideally having programs that give people opportunities for things like shadowing, mentoring, sponsoring new potential leaders can help you grow a diverse set of people into new leadership within your project. The Kubernetes contributor experience SIG is a great place to see some examples of how to implement some of these programs for things like shadowing and mentoring, and projects that make a concerted effort to bring in new people from a variety of backgrounds and have programs in place to help them grow into leadership positions are more likely to benefit from increased innovation and just have a healthier contributor community. And by having a diverse and welcoming community, you have the advantage of getting contributors that might not feel welcome in other projects. Now this, I gave it its own section, but it's really still kind of part of the strategies section, but it's important enough to call out separately since moving people into leadership positions really is a key part of growing your contributor base and scaling your project. So I'll talk about this in the context of contributor ladders, which is a good way to do this. Defining the roles and responsibilities for contributors, reviewers, maintainers can help with recruiting new people into these roles. It can help to really think of this as a ladder where contributors can climb up to become reviewers and those reviewers can become maintainers. And what's important is to document it and make sure that people understand how they can climb this ladder and move into positions with more responsibility within the project. A contributor ladder usually outlines the different roles within the project, along with responsibilities and privileges that come with them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the ladder and then they advance up as their involvement in the project grows. So for each one of the ladder, you can define responsibilities, which are the things that a contributor is expected to do. Requirements are the qualifications that a person needs to be put in that role. And then privileges are maybe some things that those contributors are entitled to do as a part of that position. And all of this helps set expectations for roles and encourages people to think about how they might take on additional responsibilities within the project. And as you get more people moving into maintainer roles, you can reduce the load of the existing maintainers. Now, the good news is that there is, like with many things, also a template, so you can avoid building this from scratch. Now, this template has probably more roles than most projects need, but it's intended to be simplified and customized for your project. Project leadership is one of the key elements of good governance, and this is how you scale your project. So you should have some kind of documentation about your leadership. For small projects, maybe you just have a list of maintainers that indicates which people are responsible for which things. And there are quite a few different options for selecting leaders as part of defining your governance. And the ideal is to have a process that provides a fair and level playing field that defines how contributors can become leaders. And this should be documented so that all participants can clearly understand the criteria and the process for moving into leadership positions. Now, some of the bigger projects, like Kubernetes, for example, have an election process, at least for the top levels of leadership, like a steering committee. But only the biggest projects actually need something that complicated. Most projects have a relatively simple process, where the existing leaders or existing maintainers get to select the new ones. So for example, new maintainers are often nominated by existing maintainers and maybe approved after a certain number of maintainers have agreed to it, or maybe there's a voting process. And there are loads of different options for selecting leaders for a project, so I won't go into all of them, but there is a, I wrote a document for the CNCF that kind of describes some different options. But the key is to spend some time thinking about this as you document your governance and as you build your contributor ladder, so that you can bring new people into leadership positions and reduce the load on the existing maintainers to help scale your project by growing your contributor base. Now, granted, mentoring takes a bit more time, but it's a good way to help existing contributors become even better, with an eye toward moving them into leadership positions. So for busy maintainers, one good approach is to focus on mentoring people who've already been around a while and are unlikely to disappear and help them learn to do maybe some more complex time consuming tasks. Like with many things, mentoring isn't something that's all or nothing, and you can time box it to whatever time you can fit in your schedule, so this doesn't have to be hours and hours every week. Even spending an hour a month or an hour a week to help someone quickly become productive in some part of your project can be time well spent if that person can then take on a few tasks that help you reduce your load as a maintainer. You can even structure this as shadowing and allow them to watch you and learn while you do some maintainer tasks that you're going to do anyways. And if you focus this on helping someone learn to do something that can free up your time later, then this will be time well spent. Now the strategic part of all of this comes in to thinking about where your time would be best spent. I've given a lot of suggestions so far in this presentation, and you should not try to do everything at once, right? So I recommend you think strategically about where you start. If you know you've had people interested in contributing, but they've given up when they couldn't get started, then maybe you focus on onboarding docs. If you have a lot of casual contributors who come around occasionally and contribute things, maybe you focus on the contributor ladder and governance to help some of them move up to take on more responsibility and eventually move into leadership positions. One way to figure out the best place to start is by using metrics. So I'm a big fan of metrics and data for those who know me. But this can help you find problem areas and figure out where you should be spending your time. Time is precious, right? So it's important to identify problem areas so that you can focus on the right things while avoiding wasting time on things that maybe are already going okay or going really well. However, metrics do need to be interpreted in light of how you operate as a community and the other things happening in your project. And there's no one-size-fits-all interpretation for metrics. But I will talk in this section about what some trends might indicate and how you can think about addressing them. One key area to look at for your project is responsiveness. So in this project, in this graph, you can see that there are times when they have a lot of PRs in the backlog that need to be merged or closed. Now, if these PRs are coming from several regular contributors who aren't maintainers, maybe it's a good time to look at how you can promote some of those contributors to become maybe reviewers, approvers, maintainers to help with the workload. Now, as with any metrics, you need to interpret them in light of your project. So there are other things that can cause an increase in the backlog, like everyone preparing for a big release or maybe there's a big conference coming up or it's vacation season in Europe that just are not resolved by moving people into leadership roles. So you have to think about maybe why you have this backlog and what might help resolve it. It can also help to look at the types of contributors that you have. So in this case, casual contributors are those drive-through contributors who make just a handful of contributions and then you never see them again. Regular contributors are the ones that make some contributions and stick around. So they continue to make some contributions but maybe not a ton of contributions. And then core contributors are usually the maintainers who make most of the contributions and stick around over the long term. Now, you can really learn a lot from this graph, actually. If you have a very small number of casual and regular contributors, this can mean that people don't have the information needed to become productive and contribute. So in some cases, onboarding docs can help solve this issue. Another thing that this graph can indicate is whether maybe you have some fundamental issues within your project that are driving people away. So if you see the total number of contributors declining or the number of regular contributors declining, this can indicate some deeper issues, maybe with toxic community members or an unwelcoming environment that probably needs to be resolved before you take any other actions to grow the community. Or it could mean people are leaving your community for some other reasons. You know, maybe lack of responsiveness is another one. Now, this metric is often called the bus factor, pony factor, lottery factor. Based on the idea that if one person or a small number of people disappeared, maybe after winning the lottery, that the project would possibly be completely screwed because they're making all of the contributions. So I recommend measuring this because there are a couple of things that can tell you. So first of all, it tells you how big of an issue this is for your current contributor situation. If it's like this one, this is a big issue and you should focus on getting some more contributors that can be moved into leadership roles. You might also find that there are people contributing more than you realized, which is the other reason that this is a good metric. This can help you think about who you can encourage to contribute more and maybe find someone who could move up the ladder into a leadership role and reaching out to someone and acknowledging their work while encouraging them to do a bit more can help quite a bit with contributor growth. Sometimes people just need a bit of encouragement. And as I mentioned earlier, you can ask people for specific things that you know they're good at. There are several communities that I've gotten more involved in or involved in in the first place because someone asked for my specific help and kind of made me feel wanted within that community. Now before I wrap up this talk, I'm going to leave you with a few resources that you might find useful. I've mentioned the CNCF contributor strategy technical advisory group a couple of times. We have a governance working group and a contributor growth working group, which provide templates and guidance about contributor experience, sustainability, governance, that sort of thing to help people develop strategies for maintaining healthy projects. The resources are designed for CNCF projects, but most of what we talk about applies just about any open source project. The open source way guidebook has loads of really great details about building and maintaining open source projects. The chaos project has loads of metric definitions and software, which you could see in my metric slides, that you can use to measure the health of your open source community. These are all great starting places for understanding how to grow your contributor community. I just mentioned the contributor strategy tag on the resources slide, but I wanted to put in a really quick recruiting plug. Like with most open source projects, we're also looking for help. We don't have enough people to contribute. Anyone's welcome to join our meetings if you want to learn about us or even better if you're passionate about contributor growth, governance or related topics and want to help CNCF projects improve in those areas. We'd love to have you join us and help us develop resources and provide advice to projects. This slide has several ways to find us and get involved. With that said, let me leave you with just a few final thoughts. Maintaining an open source project is so much work and there are so many maintainers who are overworked, exhausted, burning out. The best way to address this challenge is by growing your contributor base, but it's hard work. It takes time away from the day-to-day activities now, which can be really hard to justify when you feel like you're barely keeping up as it is. But in the longer term, spending at least a little time on things that can help you recruit and keep new contributors will be worth it in the long run. And hopefully some of the templates and resources that I've provided will help you get started with some of this work. And as I've mentioned before, you don't need to do everything at once. Spending just a little time on something to grow your contributor base is a great way to start. Thank you for coming to my talk and we can open it up for questions. That was very easy. Thank you, Don. I have a question about the lottery factor. Do you have any advice on how to measure or how to take into account quality, not just enumerating the quantity of commits that various contributors make? So the question is how to take into account quality versus quantity? Yeah, I think that that's something you have to... So you're not going to be able to measure the quality really well instead of a quantitative way, right? But I think it's something, again, it gets at interpretation. So I think it's something that you need to really think about. So there might be somebody that has loads of commits for some particular reason, but maybe they're not a major contributor to the project for some other reason. Maybe they're not a maintainer and maybe it wouldn't be a big deal if they left tomorrow. Maybe they're working on something that's fairly niche that not a lot of people use, for example. So I think you really do need to interpret those graphs. And you can think about the quality of what someone does. If that's someone who makes a ton of commits and they're kind of crap, then that's not as important as someone who makes a lot of commits that are really great. So you just need to, I think, apply a reality filter on top of it. But I don't think it's something that you can really easily measure quantitatively, but you need to just think about and kind of put a qualitative filter on top of it. Yeah, other questions? Hi. First off, great talk. I had a question about the governance side, because I work on a pretty big open source project, but the problem there is that it's owned by a company that doesn't really necessarily value open sources like one of their core reasons why they do it. Do you have any recommendations for how to advocate for governance in the open source project or company owned projects? Yeah, it's really hard to advocate for governance in company owned projects. I've tried to do it and failed in certain projects in the past. What I've found is usually the best way to approach it is to get them to document the way things work now. So not worry about changing all of the governance, not worry about coming up with some big elaborate governance structure, but how do people get moved into committed roles now? How do they get moved up? And try to encourage companies, and this is something I have this discussion internally with NVMware all the time too, is we hire people to work on certain open source projects, and so they get committer status kind of automatically, and we should be as transparent as possible about that in our governance materials, for example, that they do get special treatment as of the fact that it's a NVMware open source project, and we're paying them to do the work, so they're going to be able to commit from day one. So I think being transparent about that as transparent as possible can help, but I would say work with them to document what they have right now, and then maybe people will start to see the gaps and you can try to build on it, but it's hard, it's really hard to get good governance for company and projects. It's a tough problem. Thanks for your talk.
