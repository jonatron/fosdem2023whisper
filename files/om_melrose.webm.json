{"text": " Now let's have some music with Melrose, a program and play music by Ernest. Yes. Yeah, thank you all for waiting, it took me a bit more time to set things up, but I'm glad you're here at the end of the day, full room, and I'd like to share with you a result of an open source project I've been working on for a couple of years now. My name is Ernest Mikleij, I'm a Go developer, but my day job is actually being a manager, so this is how I program in my spare time, and yeah, so in a couple, in this presentation I want to show you what it is, what you can do with it, and if we have time I can also show you demos. So why did I start this project? So I'm also a piano player, and I noticed, as you do probably, that music is really a structured language right, so we have all kinds of patterns, and Bach is one of the famous ones, and I wanted to explore those expressions in some kind of a program language, and I took up the challenge to find the right functions, abstractions to actually program. Now I told you I'm a Go programmer, so initially I thought, okay, I'm just going to write a library and create all these function abstractions, but then I realized, okay, each time I create something like a music or a pattern, I have to compile it and restart it, listen to it, no it's not good, change it, compile it, restart it, so I quickly skipped that whole idea, and then I realized I need to offer quick feedback, and so I started thinking about a different language, and then use Go as an interpreter of that language. So what is Melrose Ndient? It's actually a combination of a language, my abstraction of how to write music, and it's also a runtime to play those things. Well, for instance, if I go here, where is it, yeah, that works, okay. So yeah, this is just a glimpse, and I will talk to you through it what it actually means, and I put this presentation in four parts, we'll talk about the language, a bit about the tool, very short part about Go, perhaps, and of course, where you all want to hear something, right? So about the language, so I decided this would be my note presentation, a note consists of several components, just a simple thing here, you can see the C and you can put length information in front of it, you can change the sharp or make it flat, change the octave by adding a number at the end, and then put in some dynamics, and I chose to use minus, minus, plus, plus to make it louder and shorter. So this is how I represent a note in the language. And these are just examples of how to express them, but I hope you already see that this is not really a good way or easy way to compose music, because then I have to type a lot of notes, right, put them together, and so very quickly, of course, I needed some another abstraction, I call it sequence, and a sequence also is typically a collection of notes, and I also added a notation to have grouping, so we can have chords, right? And this is just an example of a sequence, and this is an arrest, this is an eighth note, and so on, and I was hoping I could actually play it here, I think I can, it doesn't work, of course it doesn't work, why not, and there it is, ah, it doesn't know where to find it, I have to set the output device, you see, sorry about that, give me a minute, just restart the tool, let's see what kind of media devices there are, I think there it is, so one, still not, why not, this is the demo effect guys, I'm sorry, it happens, I think it is missing this one, so, yep, are you still with me? Something wrong with my setup guys, I don't know what, maybe I should do this, it doesn't see my synthesizer, and of course I can play it myself, but that's not really what I'm trying to sell to you, right? So maybe I will continue with, ah, there it is, I see it, sorry about that, thank you, thank you, thank you, any questions, no, so, yeah, this is just one of them, and soon I realized I need more abstractions, because, yeah, the sequence, still have to write all those notes, right, so I also have the progressions, and this is a progression, yeah, this is a chord sequence, so, yeah, the real power in the language, I think, comes from composition, so I managed to find all kinds of functions that take groups and transform it into something else, so, you need to read from right to left, so we start with a chord, which is the same as the sequence CEG, right, and then I engroup it, so I get separate notes, then I reverse it to get this, then transposes, I get that, and I repeat it four times, yes, so I can do this as well, so it takes the sequence, and it changes the number of notes by this pattern, I just came up with that pattern, and make it shorter notes, fraction, and eight, so shorter, and I repeat in a join, and the nice thing is, you can also change, I will come to that later how that works, and then I realized, ah, so I can have sounds, but I really also want to express rhythms, and then I came up with the pattern consisting of dots and bangs, so every bang and a dot represents a kick, and if it's centered to channel 10, which is the standard for drums, I shoot, pray again, if that works, now it doesn't, why not, maybe it's this channel, no, that doesn't work, for some reason, and then this doesn't work either, that's too bad, see if we can make that channel 10, no, you have to bear with me, that should work, maybe I will figure out later, let me explain how this works, so I made some variables, I extended the language to have variables, because you can reference them, that's easy, in normal program languages, and then you see a note map here, where I map the kick on all the bangs and the snare, and then there's a function called merge, that squeezes everything into one sequence, but because every note has a different instrument, they won't go all together, they each will send to the right instrument, and I'm using BPM, I can change the beat per minute, obviously, and I send the whole thing to channel 10, which for some reason doesn't work now, I don't know, okay, and there's lots more out there, so I showed you fraction, merge, and repeat, and I realized when trying to compose music like that, oh I need something that has a transpose map, and I need something random, and I need something pitch, and so the language grew and grew, like you see now, so a bit about the tool, so Melrose, the program, it doesn't produce any sound, it just uses MIDI, and MIDI, there's lots of MIDI devices out there, and so that's why I brought my synthesizer here, it's just one of those devices that we can talk to and send MIDI to, and it's very, yeah, I think most of you know MIDI, so I won't go into detail of that, and so Melrose comes actually with a binary and a web version, so the one, the binary version is running currently with my machine, just a little interpreter you just saw for changing the devices, and it actually has an HTTP interface such that each tool can talk to Melrose using HTTP, so that's the reason why my presentation sent the data to my Melrose program from my web page, right, and also have a web version that uses Wasm, web assembly, so you can play it in the browser, if your machine has some local MIDI device you can try it in the playground, and this is the whole setup, so there's this Melrose program, and I could also create it with Visual Studio Extension, so if you load your script.mel file in Visual Studio Code, you can actually have some shortcuts to talk to Melrose, and this is how I actually compose music using the tool, and because I'm actually using the MIDI, Melrose can talk to any MIDI device, it can be hardware, software such as this one, and so you can also combine multiple devices. Playing music, so you already saw BPM, and of course we have a loop, so the loop can take a sequence and just loop it, and it's very nice, I thought, because once you have a kind of a sequence and you start looping, then using a MIDI device you can find the right instrument that matches the loop, so that's how I interact with it. A bit of a behind the scenes, so if you write a program in Melrose, and you ask it to evaluate it, to play it, it will actually pass, of course the language, so you get a music object tree, and it will translate it in a bunch of note events, and it needs to schedule those events, but because each note should start at a certain moment in time, so you create a timeline, and then you play the timeline by sending all the MIDI notes to a device, and another picture that demonstrates the same thing is this is the timeline, it's actually implemented as a linked list for the programmers that know what that is, and so each time I say this is a sequence, I create this timeline and send it, and this is done in parallel, so while the music is playing, I can send more sequence to the same timeline, so I can start doing composition real-time as well. Okay, already mentioned that one, so this is where you can find my goat, and where you can download the binary, I have a Mac version and a Windows version, I created a documentation site on Melrose, and just a little note, so I choose to use the O with a dash on top of it, and because it looks like a note, but it also makes the, sorry, it also makes the whole name unique in the on the web, so if you type in this name, you'll find exactly my sign, it's nice, so now let me try to come up with another example, so let's app it, E-Piano, Taser, Taser, now we already had that one, right? So just kill it, control K, this is fine from the bells, how am I doing on time? Oh thank you, so I'm just going to show you, no I'm not showing you, I'll let you hear stuff, right? So I changed the instrument here, and this is Visual Studio Code using my extension, try to read what's happening, so there are four sequences, I joined them, but I can change of course the speed, I have to wait for the loop to end it, you see, and there's also, so I can also change, I won't do it because it will screw up the sound, I can also change the characters, and I, thank you, and I evaluate again and it will pick up the changes, and that's what I mean by the audio feedback, so without compiling the whole thing, I can just let it loop and then change, and then find another instrument, and this is how I killed the loop, okay, let me jump to this one, piano, four, and this one, yeah, thank you, oh this is a heavy one, I'm not going to do that one, so can you read it by the way, I hope so, so, ah, drum is working, you see, I already mentioned it, so it's actually doing this, and it loops the drums, as you can see, and I start another loop, I hope, yeah, there it is, yeah, and it uses the tap notation, one of the additions I did recently, so yeah, so now our two loops are running at the same time, but I can add more, and send one loop to this device, and the other one to the other device, and change it, and I'll change the text, and so on, one more, okay, okay, okay, and now ends, it's doing program, thank you, yes, yes, that's possible, the question is, can you do other MIDI things like changing program, right, yeah, so pedal support as well, and changing programs, yeah, the only thing I cannot do is change the beats per minute while it's playing, that's design decision, yeah, sorry, yeah, yes, and no, so I'm working on that to read MIDI and try to find the expression that matches the MIDI, and then start from there, but that's difficult, maybe chat GPT knows, but yeah, can you consider also using open sound control, OSC, OSC, can't remember any, I think it's using, I started out with port MIDI, when I thought about that, and then I changed it to something else, I have to look at the library, can't remember, so I didn't look at it, but no, yeah, yeah, can you get MIDI CC in? MIDI CC, oh, as an input, yeah, I skipped that whole part, but you can actually listen to MIDI events, and then trigger it by keys as well, but also make changes to it, yeah, yeah, that would be a nice demo for next time, yeah, yeah, yes, it runs on the triplet, yeah, so Go can compile to multiple platforms, so like I said, I have pre-compiled binaries, so for Windows and for Mac, but you can just grab the Go code and compile it yourself, and if you want to know the library, yeah, have a look at the source code, yes, yes, there's a function called export, and then your whole MIDI is exported, yeah, does the debugger work with breakpoints? yeah, I stole the feature to trigger the loop, so yeah, that's a nice part of the Visual Studio Code expression, sorry, good, yeah, what about the other tools, do you consider things like Sonic Pi? no, not at all, because, oh, so the question is, did I consider using Sonic Pi, but that already exists, and it, yeah, but that produces actually sounds, right, and not, I really wanted to use the MIDI and focus on composition language, yeah, have you looked at a lily pond suit? yes, I did, what do you think about it, so that's a lily pond suit? yeah, I know, yeah, I personally found it too complex, and also part of me thought, hey, let's try something else, to be honest, yes, is there a, what if the binary is running, is there like a input for Melrose, like, that you can programmatically send, like Melrose expressions? by HTTP, by sending HTTP, you set the source to Melrose, and then it gets evaluated immediately, that's how the tools interact, so you could write a program that generates Melrose, yes, yes, you could, send me the submission, yes, okay, so it's interesting that there's a crazy guy that must have the same idea you had, okay, represent music in a way that they equal handle code, so you could do diffs and stuff like that, and it's called earmuff, and the guy's called crazy, you might get along, oh, yeah, so there's another guy, just as crazy as he is doing, earmuff, oh, okay, code to MIDI, oh, I would like to see that, yeah, yeah, it's more bar-oriented, oh, okay, I would like to have a look at that, thank you, thank you, yes, one more, how suitable do you think it is for live coding where you compose as you're doing, yeah, so the question is how suitable is it for live coding, try out, I don't know, I did, as a performer, I didn't come too far that yet, but I would love to try it, really, yeah, and also because, yeah, it gives you direct audio feedback, right, so I can start multiple loops, and at the same time do all the other things, and then start the loop, or kill the loop, and, yeah, sounds interesting experiments, yeah, yeah, very good, yeah, okay, more questions, oh, yeah, thank you, you should start your show with this, I invite you, more questions, yes, melody, I thought about it, and then, yeah, nice rose, and then, and I knew about this trick from someone else that uses it, and then, ah, I'm going to register this name, that's the third thing you need to do, right, is it free, and then, no, rose, it's stuck, last question, last question, okay, you mentioned that it will generate a music object tree, yeah, is this, will you be planning on allowing other software to capture that tree so that, oh, yeah, yeah, so the question was, in my, in my, one of my slides, I showed you the music tree object, and the question was, could that be, yeah, accessible from, for other programs, yeah, yes, so can it be used for other programs, yeah, I would love to have this, this interface, yeah, I already have some kind of a visualization, so if you, you can show in the browser the whole pattern of the sequence, sometimes you need visual feedback, so sometimes I miss Ableton, yes, and, ah, well, it's another way, yeah, thank you, thank you all for joining.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 12.68, "text": " Now let's have some music with Melrose, a
