The speaker gives a talk about the ELISA project, which stands for Enabling Linux and Safety Applications. The project focuses on using open source projects, particularly Linux, in safety-critical systems, such as embedded IoT devices. The speaker explains that in order to ensure safety, it is important to understand the system context and how Linux fits into it. The project consists of various working groups, each focusing on different aspects like safety architecture, Linux features for safety critical systems, code improvement, and engineering processes. The speaker also discusses the challenges of certification for open source software and suggests ways to improve the certification processes to be more open source friendly. The talk also covers methodologies like system theoretic process analysis (STPA) and workload tracing for analyzing safety critical systems. The speaker concludes the talk by mentioning the next steps for the project, such as improving kernel configuration, displaying checks, and creating a systems AS-BOM. In the Q&A session, the speaker answers questions about the certification of Linux, its place in safety critical systems, and the development processes for certification.
