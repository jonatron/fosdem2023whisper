{"text": " There was a lot of talk about like geeks used in scientific environment for doing like reproductive research, like in geeks conference, geeks birthdays and even here before my talk. So this will be a completely different usage of geeks. So I will present first what is replicant, so fully free Android distribution and how we manage to use geeks or fail to use it basically. So yes, there is a lot of issue in smartphones. So for instance like people still have to use them to be reachable, to do mobile computing like in some country, mobile banking and so on. And it's also like often cheaper than laptops. So a lot of people use them. But yeah, the issue is that like it's to produce the smartphone like you have to mine metals and so on. So it's not good for the planet. The networks also know your location like it spies on you, the smartphones run on free software. So it's even not clear if like smartphone can really empower people because you can take pictures and things like that so you can get proof of stuff, but you also get spying. So not using smartphone is not really a solution because a lot of people use it so political activists, journalists and so on, even indigenous people for their security. So yeah, like destroying smartphone and factory is not a good option and it requires like people to have people willing to do that and to support them. So the option to fix all that stuff would be like free software so we can make for instance smartphone last longer and block some of the spying but not the fact that the network know your location and so on. So we can limit basically some of the risk and also other way to help than programming like doing political pressure and funding like doing work to get funds to fund people to do stuff. So we want 100% free software and to be usable and like I said limit the damage. So historically we like worked to fork line address and make sure we don't ship any non free software. So the idea is like to have 100% free software, Android distribution. So yeah, like Geeks basically. So this is a smartphone, you have a modem here. So this communicates with the tower and also like as access to your SIM card and it's connected also to main system on a chip on this one. So the issue is like you have a very high DPI on smartphone like the screen is very small with high resolution. So you cannot also use it with very big fingers and usually you have no hardware keyboards. So this is also why we are trying to use Android on smartphone because it's already works. So yeah. So you have like for instance several hardware you can choose from, for instance this could run with Geeks for instance. The pine phone, so you have like really the status you have nothing ideal yet. Yeah, the lot of phone like don't boot with free software in other like the modem, yeah it's isolated from the system on a chip so it can't access its RAM like take control of the operating system and so on. And like hardware usability on GNULINUX, it really depends. Like power consumption for instance on the LibreM5 is probably good enough and the pine phone it's like not there yet but it could be improved. So yeah. So we have like some fully free distribution like PureOS it works right now, it supports one device, replicant 6 it's really old it's still based on Android 6 so it has a security issue. Geeks it could probably work but it's like missing a lot of package probably. We need like probably to have like GNOME working on smartphone and so on to be able to use it and other fully free distribution they also like lack packages but you also need like for instance package to support the modem and integrate all that in the distribution so for instance for the pine phone it's as I understand there was a talk at FOSDEM last year and it's doable to package it in distribution relatively easily. So as I said replicant is like fully free software Android distribution, supports some old device and we are trying to like get it working on Android 11 still. So yeah I probably already explained why it's based on Android. So Android is like far from ideal because we don't lack any package manager during builds. So for instance distribution like Geeks you have an abstraction that can compile for instance software written with auto tools that can build with auto tools, CMake and so on. Android you have everything that's downloaded and put in the same tree so this is a big issue because we can't easily mix GNU linux with Android because Android you have everything like you have Android.mk or Android.bp it's their build system and everything is integrated together so you don't have this abstraction and also the code like it's less fun to work with with Android and like you have huge code that's not really known or very well known or detected from the free software community and we also have like issue with application for instance fdroid it's really great it has like strict licensing policy but it requires the non free Android SDK in practice to build applications. So that's maybe something that Geeks could solve one day. So the Android architecture it's it's meant really for getting like selling phones so basically at the beginning you had a modified linux kernel for instance you could have like completely different audio driver and it talks to a hardware library that makes the abstraction between the kernel and the Android frameworks so Android application talks to the Android framework and can play audio for instance. So still today there's a lot of fun that are not like supported by upstream linux so there is still like need of it still work like that and the situation is still not that good. So the security model also is Android sandbox application and linux it's much more like simple for users because in Android you often like have malware in Google Play that's removed by Google obviously but it's meant like not to trust the software while in GNU linux it trusts basically the software so it's much more easy you have root and so on. So yeah maybe I will skip that yeah no maybe not so basically in replicants we try to replace non-free code and now we are trying like to support device with upstream kernel but yeah it takes some time basically. So now I will get to the geeks specific stuff finally when I got all the background done can we run geeks on top of replicants. So replicants 6 is a very old distribution so I tried and it doesn't work we can use for instance Geekpack trying to like deploy binaries but you need a matching kernel with kernel headers so when you build it the application run and for instance changing the kernel header in geeks besides requiring to recompile everything I tried and it didn't work for me but we can run it on like recent Android versions so we simply use Geekspack and we can deploy like command line application to Android so it's really easy it's just cross compile the application so you still have like a lot of limitation with cross compiling because some build system don't support cross compiling for instance you can't like you can't run GNOME apps but you cannot even compile them because it will use like build system that are not supported for cross compiling and this is also useful if we want to support like smartphone in geeks because if we manage to cross compile software we could build image that are then can be downloaded from geeks website like for the pine 64 no pine book everything is cross compiled because the builder run on x86 machines so yeah and we would like in replicant to like support using geeks but it's really too big to ship so instead we will try to implement the missing dependency and maybe add an installer based on geeks install this is the standard way to install geeks on existing distribution so this doesn't work basically we cannot do like Android package yet in geeks so the issue is we would need like a real Android indicate to do that because Android use a different Lipsy that's bionic so maybe if like people want to do it new like target like for cross compilation would need to be added but this is probably a lot of work but yeah the issue is also in in Android application and maybe in lot of modern programming language when you install something like with pip install it will install a lot of dependency and basically you don't really know what's in there for instance for for like JavaScript it's npm you can have a lot of dependency and you you really lose control so if geeks would be able to like build Android application it would be a way to fix the SDK issue the fdroid is having and also like really know what's inside the application and control it then there is the issue of can we build an Android distribution with geeks so as I said there's a Lipsy difference so the issue is that yeah I sorry I already explained that the Android build system it's you don't have like package definition in it so this has issue of licensing and no abstraction for the build system like auto tools cmax and so on so Android usually like requires huge resources to build because again you don't have like package manager so you have to build everything at once as far as I know and so can we like if we package for instance all Android in geeks there has been work that has started to do that you hit some issue for instance the the Android build system geeks supports android.mk so it's it supports the old Android build system so this is why it's probably limited to Android 7 and the newer android.bp with blueprints need to be supported to like be able to build Android components and also it would be tied to glipsy I don't know if it would work but yeah maybe it works so but yeah the advantage also it would be easier to build since you could just use geeks on an existing distribution again you would know like the licensing on the package how it's done you wouldn't have this build problem of building everything you could just build a part of it so it would fix a lot of issue but the the issue is that if for instance replicant does that we would be tied to geeks and there is also there is the real risk of like not be being stuck at some point because geeks is it's it's really nice it's strict for like programming language and so on it tries to bootstrap things like even make you use a shell script to like bootstrap make you cannot use make to bootstrap make sometimes there are exceptions like for haskell where geeks use a binary compiler to bootstrap the compiler but usually it's done well so it it takes time basically to like add newer android build system and julien lepellier did did a talk about that explaining all all the effort required required for that so yeah it's it would be a big bet and it would be risky so use for instance using geeks inside the android build system for like I don't know building the kernel or and putting the binary inside maybe it would be a better solution for that or even like trying to use like geeks shell for instance to make like to install a required package to make a container of it it's really really simple you do geekshell.c-f because you can now have fhs option you have like a standard distribution with user bin etc you don't have everything in slash GNU anymore or at least that's how the tools see it and so you that's how for instance bitcoin can be built inside bitcoin core you have a way to build a reproducible binary and it use geeks in the background not with fhs yet but it was done before but that's how it works basically so you can use it to build stuff but and android it's also isolated from the host when building stuff so it doesn't it tries to avoid using like python from the host and so on so it could probably work so this is like how where we yeah so we we still have like some real use case of geeks and we will go into it for instance like we use all distribution to build android because android the android version we use require that so like using geeks to ship some more recent tools that are required works basically and one of the big use cases so it's also automatic testing because a lot of projects use things like docker and again you don't know what's in the container it's like you give control to docker hub you you don't like host your own infrastructure and so on and with geeks it's much more easy to like do it without like depending on infrastructure like that so basically we have a modem and we have a library that talks to modem drivers it's a bit like i don't know qmi and things like that so this is specific for samsung phones so we can use geeks.scm to test that automatically so this is in some software mainly guile software and geeks obviously you have some people writing files like that where you have a package sorry wrong file uh yes you have you have package definition like that for instance sorry yes here so people use package definition to be able to automatically ah five minutes sorry to automatically test software um so we use that to like test this library when built with gnu linux with gcc silang and silang and also with the android build system uh so uh basically sorry so in the android build system you have uh like sorry uh yes you have like targets like that so this is to to build a tool so there is the the source code here and you have um sorry uh yes it's that one so geeks has an android build system which is a project that's just a mac file that includes the android specific mac file that can then build targets so it's it's pretty limited because it's really nice because it's simple but because it's mac file based uh here it includes the android the specific file to build software but you can have only one target so what we can do is in geeks.sm we parse the file and we uh basically we compile it for all targets and we can even like run val green and a lot of stuff inside uh so yeah uh how many how many minutes three questions okay uh sorry so we also use geeks for some of uh infrastructure so basically i did this talk because like there is a lot of presentation on geeks for like scientific software but less on other use case so do you have questions yeah uh what did you uh what triggered you to use geeks for uh a replicant building uh basically uh it's to like have a complete uh test treat uh that's uh without much complexity oh can you repeat the question sorry what triggered you to use geeks uh for uh to use geeks for building for yeah for doing tests it's fine uh so if i wanted to do test i can't do all the tests for instance with the various leapsy build system uh usually in autotools you have like you can run scripts but you can't rebuild the stuff with other dependencies so it's really not supported so the flexibility here it's like really huge you can test almost everything and you even like have uh power pc support so you can test for big and yand too so it's uh yeah other question replicants uh so what is the future of replicants so i'm trying to get funding through an lnet again to support the pine fun in replicants and make glow droid squad reusable easily by other distribution and also uh part usb began to the pine fun to to android basically to isolate the modem because the modem could like try to become a keyboard it's really easy to do with a usb uh gadget and then like start typing commands so we really want to isolate the modem uh is there other question or yes are you investigating using nix instead of wix ah so we are fully can you repeat the question uh sorry um have you considered using nix instead of gix uh no because nix is not uh validated by the dfsf and we are so we need to use like stuff that's fully free and so we would need like to maybe fork nix and it's a lot of work you", "segments":
