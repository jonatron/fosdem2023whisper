The speaker, a developer working on porting RISC-V to GNU Geeks, discussed their experience with porting software to the RISC-V architecture. They explained how Geeks, a transactional package manager, allows for easy rollback and undoing of changes during the porting process. They highlighted the differences between RISC-V and other architectures, such as ARM, and mentioned the increasing adoption and availability of RISC-V boards. The speaker also mentioned various programming languages and their support for RISC-V, such as Rust, Go, Haskell, and Java. They discussed the challenges and progress in porting these languages to RISC-V and provided insights into the build and testing processes. The speaker also touched on the topic of desktop environments and mentioned their efforts in building and testing them on RISC-V. They discussed the hardware they used, including the Sci-Fi Unmatched and Vision 5 boards. The speaker shared their plans for future work, including exploring the use of the GCC Rust front end for bootstrapping and improving Java support. They also mentioned the cross-compilation capabilities of Geeks and how it is used in the porting process. Overall, the talk provided an overview of the speaker's experience and progress in porting software to RISC-V using the Geeks package manager.
