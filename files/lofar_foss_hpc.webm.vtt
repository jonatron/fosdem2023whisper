WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.880
Okay, we're ready for the next talk by Courtney who's going to talk about open source radio

00:17.880 --> 00:20.360
astronomy.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.360
So hi everyone.

00:21.360 --> 00:27.440
I work for Ostron which is the Dutch Institute for Radio Astronomy, we're a government institute

00:27.440 --> 00:30.600
so we're publicly funded.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.560
Apart from being publicly funded we have a lot of research grants and that's basically

00:34.560 --> 00:40.040
what pays my salary and I'm going to talk about our biggest instrument that we have

00:40.040 --> 00:45.480
which is called LOFAR and we actually utilize a lot of open source software there, almost

00:45.480 --> 00:48.000
exclusively there's some caveats.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.320
My name is Courtney Leuker by the way, I'm also into amateur radio, my call sign is

00:52.320 --> 00:57.240
Papa Delta 3 Sierra Uniform, this is going to be quite a relaxed talk, we're going to

00:57.240 --> 01:01.200
give a high level overview of all the different components that are there, there's quite

01:01.200 --> 01:06.200
a lot of them actually so it's not possible to go into detail with the time we have.

01:06.200 --> 01:11.560
This is my first forced them talk ever and also my first talk ever in a lecture hall

01:11.560 --> 01:14.800
so that's quite interesting.

01:14.800 --> 01:19.240
Now some background, I mentioned that we're a government institute, we firmly believe

01:19.240 --> 01:24.480
public money means public code and we stand by that in almost everything we do already,

01:24.480 --> 01:29.120
we have an open source committee that also ensures that we do that and we have basically

01:29.120 --> 01:34.520
two very big telescopes, one's called LOFAR which stands for Low Frequency Array and the

01:34.520 --> 01:39.400
other is the Westerbork Synthesis Telescope also called WSRT.

01:39.400 --> 01:45.120
There's some sister institutes that you work closely with or are related to us, one is

01:45.120 --> 01:50.480
called Kamras which maintains a telescope that we've stopped using and the others are

01:50.480 --> 01:54.720
Jive and EVN, I'm not going to talk too much about those today.

01:54.720 --> 01:59.600
What I want to tell you is that there is this principle that our radio telescopes work on

01:59.600 --> 02:05.680
that is called very long baseline interferometry and this enables us to do radio astronomy

02:05.680 --> 02:11.520
in a way that wasn't possible with traditional radio telescopes.

02:11.520 --> 02:17.120
This is the whole map of LOFAR, there's 54 stations in total, roughly 25 of those are

02:17.120 --> 02:18.840
located in the Netherlands.

02:18.840 --> 02:24.280
I say it's around 2,000 kilometers in diameter but that's no longer true because the one

02:24.280 --> 02:29.960
in Rosen is new and we're now about 2,500 kilometers in diameter.

02:29.960 --> 02:35.440
This diameter is also called the baseline which is where the very long baseline interferometry

02:35.440 --> 02:36.440
comes from.

02:36.440 --> 02:42.880
If we then zoom into a station you see all these tiles and you see these little squares

02:42.880 --> 02:49.520
and those are the different types of antennae and that is what makes this type of radio

02:49.520 --> 02:54.680
astronomy so interesting is that we don't have a single antenna to catch radio waves,

02:54.680 --> 03:00.720
we have lots of them, about 20,000 in total actually which is quite substantial.

03:00.720 --> 03:07.200
This center is called the super-turb and it's located in Exlo, the Netherlands.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.080
How can we actually combine this data?

03:09.080 --> 03:15.120
I told you that traditional radio astronomy relies on a parabolic dish or a single antenna

03:15.120 --> 03:19.160
and we try to scale those up, make them bigger and bigger but of course physics are at the

03:19.160 --> 03:25.080
limits at some point, you can't make a structure from steel that's like 500 meters in diameter.

03:25.080 --> 03:33.040
What we do instead is we combine smaller antennas to act as if they are a parabolic antenna

03:33.040 --> 03:37.720
and the trick about a parabolic antenna is that all radio waves, no matter where they

03:37.720 --> 03:43.520
are incoming from, they all have an equal distance to the receiver so we need to emulate

03:43.520 --> 03:47.400
that with our antennas and we do that in two ways.

03:47.400 --> 03:53.400
That is an artificial delay, an analog artificial delay by just making the line that it needs

03:53.400 --> 03:59.360
to travel across on the PCB or the coax cable longer but we can also do it digitally after

03:59.360 --> 04:05.520
the data is being sampled and then we can aim into the sky and create a very narrow

04:05.520 --> 04:10.680
beam that observes a very small portion of the sky and that allows us to zoom really

04:10.680 --> 04:16.520
deep into space and make very detailed images.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.840
But what is this radio waves actually?

04:18.840 --> 04:19.840
What are those?

04:19.840 --> 04:20.840
What are we observing?

04:20.840 --> 04:25.720
There are two types of radio waves that are being emitted by objects in space and the

04:25.720 --> 04:26.720
galaxy.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.720
We're only going to describe one phenomena today that's called synchrotron radiation.

04:31.720 --> 04:36.680
Basically if you have an ion, a charged particle, you accelerate that, then it starts creating

04:36.680 --> 04:38.600
radio wave emissions.

04:38.600 --> 04:44.280
The frequency and the intensity at the frequency that is actually very dependent, that's all

04:44.280 --> 04:49.280
details that are not very interesting for this talk, but one of these entities that

04:49.280 --> 04:53.920
emit these types of charged particles are sometimes black holes and we'll see an example

04:53.920 --> 04:56.320
of that at the end.

04:56.320 --> 05:01.040
So I mentioned black holes, there's other types of radio astronomy that are very interesting.

05:01.040 --> 05:06.320
We can also model our own ionosphere or enlightening.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.920
Pulsars are pretty interesting, these are stars that are rotating at a periodic interval

05:10.920 --> 05:16.600
and they have very strong radio waves coming from the poles of those stars.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.320
So what does Lover actually look like?

05:18.320 --> 05:23.640
A very small antenna as I told you, we can see on the left that there's like wires attached

05:23.640 --> 05:28.720
to those poles, those are actually dipole antennas and if you configure them like this

05:28.720 --> 05:32.960
where they are like a V-shape, they are called inverted Vs.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.000
These are the low-band antennas and on the right side you see the high-band antennas,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.680
they're like a clover shape, like a tie shape.

05:41.680 --> 05:48.280
Then we combine all these antennas, low-band antennas and 69 high-band antennas in a station

05:48.280 --> 05:53.160
and we send the data at around 3 gigabits per second to our HPC clusters.

05:53.160 --> 05:58.400
There's a two-phase cluster here, the first is GPU processing where we do correlation

05:58.400 --> 06:06.440
and beamforming and the second is a central processing which is more like CPU based.

06:06.440 --> 06:12.520
In the early days our computing cluster looked something like this, we had IBM BlueJeans

06:12.520 --> 06:18.240
machines which were based on PowerPC and they had a 3D torus interconnect which is actually

06:18.240 --> 06:22.080
a quite interesting interconnect.

06:22.080 --> 06:27.160
This was problematic because utilizing the floating point vector extensions required

06:27.160 --> 06:31.840
manually rewriting assembly which wasn't that nice and it was pretty hard to find developers

06:31.840 --> 06:34.480
who were willing or capable to do that.

06:34.480 --> 06:45.800
So we moved to commodity hardware, GPUs, two CPUs per socket, two GPUs per server, two

06:45.800 --> 06:51.520
GPUs per server, lots of networking.

06:51.520 --> 06:57.520
That's really what you see here, we had 32 gigabytes of 10 gigabit Ethernet and then

06:57.520 --> 07:05.720
in 2018 when we upgraded we had 24 times or 23 times of 100 gigabits in FiniBand but you

07:05.720 --> 07:11.840
also see that there's a lot of 10 gigabit Ethernet per device and I'm gonna go into

07:11.840 --> 07:16.400
that wider this in a minute.

07:16.400 --> 07:22.320
If you look at the data flow or more like a software site then you see that the antennas

07:22.320 --> 07:29.000
have ADC so these conferred the analog waves that are incoming to digital signals and then

07:29.000 --> 07:36.400
we do beamforming on the stations and we send data to the correlator and this correlator

07:36.400 --> 07:44.880
also does the correlation afterwards and you can see that once the correlator is done

07:44.880 --> 07:50.200
with it we store this to disk and once it's stored on disk then it's made available to

07:50.200 --> 07:52.440
the central processing.

07:52.440 --> 07:58.360
So the correlator and our GPU cluster cobalt are doing like streaming and the central processing

07:58.360 --> 08:02.720
is more like your traditional HPC.

08:02.720 --> 08:07.120
When we look at the data flow in cobalt there's all this incoming 10 gigabit Ethernet and

08:07.120 --> 08:13.760
this is why we have four or three 10 gigabit Ethernet links per cobalt server.

08:13.760 --> 08:19.120
They are streaming the data and we configure per station where it needs to send its data

08:19.120 --> 08:20.960
to.

08:20.960 --> 08:28.400
Then once it's there it's being transposed at roughly 240 gigabits and once it's transposed

08:28.400 --> 08:33.440
we do have two pipelines that essentially run in parallel, one is correlation and one

08:33.440 --> 08:38.200
is additional beamforming so we actually beamform twice in a sense.

08:38.200 --> 08:42.960
It's little bit more complicated than I'm sketching here but I'm keeping things simple

08:42.960 --> 08:48.840
because stations also have the capability to not beamform and send unbeamformed data.

08:48.840 --> 08:52.840
We have a special buffer that's called the transient buffer where we dump raw samples

08:52.840 --> 09:00.120
and can send those two clusters but the general pipeline is what I'm sketching here.

09:00.120 --> 09:05.720
If I assume into these two pipelines the correlator pipeline and the beamformer pipeline I don't

09:05.720 --> 09:09.680
want you to look at the details too much here because that's not interesting and I really

09:09.680 --> 09:15.120
don't have time to explain it but the trick is almost everything you see here is based

09:15.120 --> 09:18.920
on signal processing, digital signal processing.

09:18.920 --> 09:19.920
That's what we're doing.

09:19.920 --> 09:25.080
We're using the fast Fourier transform, finite input response filters and transforming the

09:25.080 --> 09:30.160
data in like the frequency domain if you will.

09:30.160 --> 09:36.320
Then it's put back into CPU memory at cobalt, some final transformations are being placed

09:36.320 --> 09:41.320
and then it's put into the disk so that's how it can work on it.

09:41.320 --> 09:47.840
At Ostrone we do a lot with software and I've showed you now how the data flows but I haven't

09:47.840 --> 09:52.640
told you what software components are making that data flow happen.

09:52.640 --> 09:58.560
For cobalt, it's actually one solid product that lives in the low-fiber repository.

09:58.560 --> 10:04.920
Please don't all now visit or get lab instance at once because it will die if you do that.

10:04.920 --> 10:08.520
Try to spread that out a little bit over the day.

10:08.520 --> 10:16.160
I'm sure I will upload the slides soon after so you don't have to remember all this.

10:16.160 --> 10:20.720
Then this, all these tools that are listed here basically except for cobalt with lifts

10:20.720 --> 10:27.200
in the low-fiber repo, those are more like what you would find on the SAP side of things.

10:27.200 --> 10:32.400
I'm going to explain, I want to address that this is just the tip of the iceberg.

10:32.400 --> 10:37.800
On our GitHub repo you can find a lot of more stuff that you can play with and I would encourage

10:37.800 --> 10:40.480
you to do so because it's quite interesting.

10:40.480 --> 10:45.320
Then there's also CASA core which is heavily being developed at Ostrone as well but it's

10:45.320 --> 10:48.240
not actually just a product just by us.

10:48.240 --> 10:56.200
A competitor or like a friend of CASA core would be AstroPie, very widely known packages

10:56.200 --> 10:58.840
in the industry.

10:58.840 --> 11:03.280
If you look at the radio astronomy tool kit, so the necessary things to go from antenna

11:03.280 --> 11:06.920
to image if you will, then these are your friends.

11:06.920 --> 11:15.160
There's DP cubed, WaySW clean, and IDG, and Rattler, AO flagger and I'm not going to talk

11:15.160 --> 11:17.080
too much about every beam.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.200
What do these things do?

11:18.200 --> 11:20.360
What are we looking at here?

11:20.360 --> 11:25.080
DP cubed is where you define a complete pipeline, so you have the incoming data, you need to

11:25.080 --> 11:31.440
do some transformations on the data, maybe you want to identify some noise sources that

11:31.440 --> 11:36.480
might be in your data, and eventually you want to create an image, and for this imaging

11:36.480 --> 11:40.080
you need deconvolution as well, and you also need gridding and de-gridding.

11:40.080 --> 11:45.840
So, AO flagger is where you identify noise sources, this can be anything, like radio

11:45.840 --> 11:51.520
instruments are very sensitive, so one noise source in particular would be electric fences,

11:51.520 --> 11:58.080
windmills, solar farms, bed quality LED lighting.

11:58.080 --> 12:04.400
Then we move to the imaging part with WaySW clean because when you have a radio telescope

12:04.400 --> 12:10.640
consisting of many small antennas, in between your antennas there are holes, and that means

12:10.640 --> 12:16.000
that you're not receiving the data as if you would have a very large parabolic dish, there

12:16.000 --> 12:17.560
are some differences.

12:17.560 --> 12:22.080
This creates some kind of fringing in the image that you need to filter out, and that's

12:22.080 --> 12:28.400
what WaySW clean together with Rattler and IDG are doing.

12:28.400 --> 12:35.800
In IDG is your translation from the data domain to like a domain that is useful for radio

12:35.800 --> 12:39.000
astronomical imaging.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.160
So I talked a little bit about CASACOR and how it was industry widely used, it's based

12:44.160 --> 12:48.840
on all the packages that have been around for a very long time, but we've actually

12:48.840 --> 12:54.040
switched it around now, so now CASACOR is built on these older packages, on top of these

12:54.040 --> 12:59.520
older packages, rather than CASACOR depending on these older packages.

12:59.520 --> 13:04.560
There's several unique features here, the UV domain is pretty interesting, so that's

13:04.560 --> 13:13.880
the domain about having your, about the plane that is filled, so those holes in your surface

13:13.880 --> 13:16.440
area if you will.

13:16.440 --> 13:20.600
And there's some phytonda bindings here, so these are all very nice tools that you can

13:20.600 --> 13:23.840
just play with.

13:23.840 --> 13:28.320
We also use a lot of open source tools, and we're doing quite well, there's still some

13:28.320 --> 13:35.400
close source software, I'll get into that in a minute, so we use OpenMPI, OpenMP, Slurm,

13:35.400 --> 13:42.000
GitLab, Grafana, and actually the part that I work on is PyTango, which is a SCADA system.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.320
So with supervisory control and data acquisition, that's basically your interface that we have

13:47.320 --> 13:52.920
on the individual stations, and those stations then configure underlying hardware with the

13:52.920 --> 14:00.920
antennas and the ADCs, and they report how they are configured to a higher level system.

14:00.920 --> 14:07.640
We also use Prometheus, Docker, and a variety of interesting open source tools, this is

14:07.640 --> 14:12.040
just the tip of the iceberg as well, there's much more.

14:12.040 --> 14:16.480
Next to our SEP cluster is also pretty interesting, which is actually where we use Slurm, we also

14:16.480 --> 14:23.760
have a DustSys cluster, which is a cluster shared with many universities within the country.

14:23.760 --> 14:30.960
Things where we can improve, well, we use CUDA, so that's not really open source compared

14:30.960 --> 14:37.400
to OpenCL or Falcon, we're using WinCC for monitoring, maybe you've heard of that package,

14:37.400 --> 14:43.160
it's Windows-based, that's why it's called WinCC, we're trying to face it out for Grafana

14:43.160 --> 14:47.760
and Prometheus, that's going quite well, I'd say.

14:47.760 --> 14:53.200
We have a lot of closed source SEPDA vendor blocks, so if you have your silings or what

14:53.200 --> 14:59.520
have you or your Altera, then they for instance offer IP blocks to implement 100 gigabit ethernet

14:59.520 --> 15:06.760
interfaces, and they're not too keen on you sharing those with the whole wide world.

15:06.760 --> 15:10.480
Then InfinityBand firmware is pretty closed source, I believe there's open source versions

15:10.480 --> 15:15.880
of that, but I don't think I know if they work quite well, and then the main area that

15:15.880 --> 15:21.400
we're actually struggling is with office management tools.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.480
This is definitely the area that we can improve the most at Astrone, we use Office 365 Slack

15:26.480 --> 15:31.480
and Zoom, and as you can see, Copano, Metamode, Jitsi, there's definitely open source alternatives

15:31.480 --> 15:36.040
to this, so there's no real reason why we should be using this.

15:36.040 --> 15:40.560
Of course, you need to host the infrastructure, and that also costs money, so there's some

15:40.560 --> 15:43.880
little way there, I'm not saying that it's definitely cheaper, but there's open source

15:43.880 --> 15:46.880
alternatives to this.

15:46.880 --> 15:52.200
Now I want to show you, I told you about IDG, that does the gridding and de-gridding, I

15:52.200 --> 15:57.880
told you about WSWClean, and the Dravartler part that does the deconvolution now, and

15:57.880 --> 16:01.640
I want to show you how those tools work in practice.

16:01.640 --> 16:07.920
So we have an IDO point source, this is our most IDO radio source that can possibly exist,

16:07.920 --> 16:12.920
it creates a very sharp point in the sky, we put it toward the gridding, and we get

16:12.920 --> 16:14.480
a point function.

16:14.480 --> 16:18.800
What this basically is, is this is the error of our telescope, so we now know, okay, this

16:18.800 --> 16:24.520
is the error it's going to generate in our images, because we don't have complete filling

16:24.520 --> 16:30.720
of the UV plane, there are holes in between our antennae, and then we can use the WSWClean

16:30.720 --> 16:36.640
image together with Dravartler for deconvolution to create an iterative process in which we

16:36.640 --> 16:39.760
iteratively remove the noise from the image.

16:39.760 --> 16:46.360
So actually I'm going to see, oh yeah, that's nice, so here you see these lines, these lines

16:46.360 --> 16:52.240
are the fringes that I've told, and if you then perform these iterative cleaning process

16:52.240 --> 16:57.800
on what are called calibrated visibilities, then we iteratively see that this image is

16:57.800 --> 17:01.280
drastically improved.

17:01.280 --> 17:06.360
So now some example of this, what is the science that we do with Lofar, how does this look

17:06.360 --> 17:07.360
like?

17:07.360 --> 17:13.200
Well this is the, this is a paper by Erk Timmermann, so you can look at it when you spare time,

17:13.200 --> 17:18.240
and what we're basically seeing here is we're seeing huge jets of this synchrotron radiation

17:18.240 --> 17:22.880
emissions that are talked about, and you can see that they actually over millions of years

17:22.880 --> 17:28.040
they vary in intensity, and at the center of this image is actually a black hole, but

17:28.040 --> 17:34.600
you can't see that because it's a black hole, and then on the background of this image there

17:34.600 --> 17:39.920
is an overlay of what's the optical domain, so not the radio domain from the Hubble Space

17:39.920 --> 17:45.440
Telescope, and this is what we have been able to capture with Lofar.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.800
So we're doing groundbreaking science, and we're going to do a lot more, we're in the

17:49.800 --> 17:54.840
middle of a big upgrade that's scheduled for the end of 2014, Vincisi is going to be replaced

17:54.840 --> 18:00.040
with Kavana, we're thinking about Allerta, but I've heard that Kavana has persisted

18:00.040 --> 18:05.880
alarms during, actually forced them today, so we might not need Allerta, and we're using

18:05.880 --> 18:07.440
Prometheus.

18:07.440 --> 18:11.440
We had this low band antennas, and the high band antennas, I briefly skimmed over that

18:11.440 --> 18:17.400
because the details, yeah, you have to cut some corners somewhere, but basically with

18:17.400 --> 18:21.960
Lofar 2 we'll be able to use both of them in a single observation.

18:21.960 --> 18:26.520
We'll also be able to use multiple beams, so we talked about the beam forming, currently

18:26.520 --> 18:32.120
Lofar is only able to have a single beam per observation, and we will also be able to point

18:32.120 --> 18:38.720
at different points in the sky, change that during an observation, and we call this mega

18:38.720 --> 18:45.800
mode, don't ask me why, yeah, we're completely refamping the skater system, we're now using

18:45.800 --> 18:51.600
Pytango, we have sufficiently upgraded hardware, Unibor 2s, we actually sell those to external

18:51.600 --> 18:57.200
institutes as well, so they're available, and we're drastically improving the timing

18:57.200 --> 19:02.000
distribution, so we're currently GPS based, everything is synchronized using GPS, all

19:02.000 --> 19:06.240
the stations across Europe, and we're going to use the white rabbit protocol that's made

19:06.240 --> 19:11.000
by CERN, that's based on a precision time protocol.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.780
Now very briefly this mega mode, what would this schematically look like, so this is basically

19:15.780 --> 19:21.200
what's running on cobalt or GPU cluster, and we do imaging and beam forming, and now we

19:21.200 --> 19:28.000
have one beam and several pointings, and they stay the same during observations, now we

19:28.000 --> 19:32.920
can have multiple beams, and we can repoint during the observation.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.600
That's going to create a lot of flexibility for the astronomers, and I'm going to be very

19:36.600 --> 19:40.560
excited with the science that is going to come from this.

19:40.560 --> 19:47.480
I want to leave you with some links, as mentioned our Astron repo, the Astron website, there's

19:47.480 --> 19:52.840
a very interesting page about 10 years of LOFAR, because we've actually existed, LOFAR

19:52.840 --> 19:57.400
has been in production since 2008, so that's been since quite some time, there's this very

19:57.400 --> 20:01.840
nice map on which you can actually see all the physical locations of all the stations,

20:01.840 --> 20:08.000
how many antennas are active or working or broken, so this is all open data, you can

20:08.000 --> 20:12.240
just look at this, and there's some history about all these presentations that I've done

20:12.240 --> 20:21.320
in the past, so any questions?

20:21.320 --> 20:47.640
Maybe first a short comment, the Chinese built a 500 meter dish, but what I really wanted

20:47.640 --> 20:52.800
to ask is whether you have collaboration with other astrophysical observations like square

20:52.800 --> 20:55.640
kilometer array or something like that?

20:55.640 --> 21:02.080
Well actually we collaborate on the square kilometer array, so there's definitely, can

21:02.080 --> 21:05.640
you repeat part of your question, because people were just leaving?

21:05.640 --> 21:10.360
Well, whether there is shared development in software and stuff?

21:10.360 --> 21:15.720
Yeah, yeah, for sure, for instance on CASACOR as I mentioned, but also WS Clean, we see

21:15.720 --> 21:24.240
contributions from external collaborators, and especially the jive, the part of jive

21:24.240 --> 21:32.200
that I showed at the very beginning, let me see, shouldn't be too long, so here I mentioned

21:32.200 --> 21:38.640
jive and EVN, this is a huge collaboration of parabolic dishes that are all connected

21:38.640 --> 21:49.400
and all the data is sent centrally to Dringelo at the headquarters of Astong, and that's

21:49.400 --> 21:57.000
actually where the EVN network processes all this data, but all these dishes that we use,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.600
those are not ours, right, those are from other parties.

22:00.600 --> 22:13.520
Someone's asking, since everything is processed digitally, can these telescopes focus on multiple

22:13.520 --> 22:17.960
targets at once by processing the data multiple times?

22:17.960 --> 22:22.960
That's an interesting question, and that depends, as I said you have the transient buffers which

22:22.960 --> 22:29.800
dump raw samples, but typically what we do is we already do beamforming on the station,

22:29.800 --> 22:33.040
and if you do the beamforming on the station, you're already looking at some point in the

22:33.040 --> 22:38.640
sky, you're only sending the result data from that beamforming to this cobalt cluster,

22:38.640 --> 22:43.480
you can't beamform again then, the data is lost, it's reductive in nature, but if you

22:43.480 --> 22:49.600
would send the raw sample data to cobalt, and it could somehow process all the data,

22:49.600 --> 22:56.240
which I don't think it has the bandwidth to do so, then you could, at a later point in

22:56.240 --> 23:02.000
time, point at any point in the sky again, which is, that's the job of the transient

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
buffers.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Thanks.

23:04.000 --> 23:17.800
Maybe I have a question here, would there be any ways or interests for amateur astronomers,

23:17.800 --> 23:27.240
or radio astronomers, to help or work with astronomy?

23:27.240 --> 23:31.920
Well there's definitely job positions on our page all the time, I think, I don't know

23:31.920 --> 23:36.480
if most are in the field of radio astronomy, but what typically happens, and I can briefly

23:36.480 --> 23:42.160
explain, is we have a system called Nordstar, in which astronomers submit their proposals

23:42.160 --> 23:47.040
and describe what they want to do with their instrument, and then we have a community that

23:47.040 --> 23:50.920
looks at that, and that actually accepts these proposals, and then they are scheduled.

23:50.920 --> 23:54.880
This is actually a very good question, because I completely skipped this in the talk, but

23:54.880 --> 23:59.840
I wanted to talk about this, and then things are scheduled in a system called TMS, and

23:59.840 --> 24:05.440
that basically looks at, okay, what part of these stations are required, and to do these

24:05.440 --> 24:10.680
observations and collect these data, then these data are collected and processed on cobalt

24:10.680 --> 24:14.800
and sap, and the data products are made available to these individual astronomers who've done

24:14.800 --> 24:20.040
that, and they get exclusive access for a period of time to do their research.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.040
Okay, thanks.

24:21.040 --> 24:31.280
I was more thinking about, just if someone is in Africa with a homemade dish, is there

24:31.280 --> 24:39.520
any way to capture something with an SDR, and add a little bit with data, or the scale

24:39.520 --> 24:42.360
of things is so different that...

24:42.360 --> 24:47.080
What's actually very important, or it's rather we need to model a lot of things and calibrate

24:47.080 --> 24:52.640
a lot of things, so that's why all the stations are roughly similar in shape, similar in shape,

24:52.640 --> 24:56.880
have similar hardware, so it would be definitely possible to buy your own station, build your

24:56.880 --> 25:02.720
own station, and have the same hardware, and then hook it up, that happens all the time.

25:02.720 --> 25:08.400
Different countries do that, buy stations, and then we add them, but having vastly different

25:08.400 --> 25:12.680
hardware and then hooking this up to the system would be very difficult, it's not designed

25:12.680 --> 25:13.680
to do that.

25:13.680 --> 25:21.720
Okay, so if you would make a very cheap station that could be built by amateur astronomers,

25:21.720 --> 25:27.960
you could deploy that everywhere in the world, and then make your public radio astronomy

25:27.960 --> 25:28.960
like that.

25:28.960 --> 25:39.560
Interesting, thanks.
