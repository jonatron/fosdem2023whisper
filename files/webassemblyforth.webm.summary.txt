The talk is about two minimal and useful languages, FORTH and WebAssembly (WA). FORTH is a stack-based programming language that has been around since the 70s and is known for its simplicity. WA is an open standard for portable binary code that can be executed by most browsers. The speaker created WA FORTH, a small FORTH system written in WebAssembly that can be embedded in any JavaScript application. WA FORTH can be used to run FORTH code inside JavaScript and has bi-directional bindings with JavaScript. The speaker also developed a graphical programming environment and a VS Code extension using WA FORTH. WA FORTH's runtime is about 15K, but using WA4C, which is a method to compile FORTH code to native code, the binary of the system is reduced to about 116K. The speaker also mentioned that WA FORTH is about 10 times faster than JavaScript FORTH implementation and WA can be used to compile FORTH code to native code for any architecture.
