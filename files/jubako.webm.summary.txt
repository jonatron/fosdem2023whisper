The talk introduces Djubaco, a new, generic format that could replace the Zim format used by the Qwix project to provide content offline. Djubaco is a meta-container that tells you how to store things, but it's up to the user to decide what to store and how to organize them. The archive is mainly read-only and has a selective compression feature, and users can do random access without initial decompression. The talk presents various potential use cases, including file archives, GIM, OCI containers, backing up, embedding resources, and more. The speaker compares Djubaco to existing formats such as SquashFS and ZIP and highlights the advantages and challenges of using it.
