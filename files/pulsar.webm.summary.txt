The talk is about modernizing legacy messaging systems with Apache Pulsar. The speakers, Mary and Enrico from Datastax, introduce JMS, its core concepts, and its limitations in terms of modern cloud-native environments. They then introduce Apache Pulsar, an open-source platform that supports messaging and streaming, and explain its features and benefits. The speakers also demonstrate how to use the JMS API with Pulsar using examples and code snippets. They emphasize Pulsar's cloud-native architecture, scalability, and multi-language support, and highlight the ease of migrating from JMS to Pulsar. They conclude by providing resources for further information and offering support for any questions or project ideas.
