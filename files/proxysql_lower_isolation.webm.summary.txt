The speaker, Xavier, gives a presentation on his work as an assistant engineer at ProxySQL. He discusses load balancing, query routing, and cluster monetization in Gallera clusters while focusing on the semantics and synchronization issues. He emphasizes the importance of controlling throughput and adapting the system to a specific workload. Xavier also provides benchmarks using Seizebench and suggests using a single writer for a multi-primary cluster to improve performance while handling critical reads and writes by reading them from the master node only.
