The talk given at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about the implementation of confidential computing with RISC-V, an open source instruction set architecture (ISA) for CPUs. The speaker discussed the RISC-V landscape and the importance of open source hardware in achieving confidential computing. They highlighted the simplicity, modularity, and stability of RISC-V, and explained the privilege modes and extensions in the ISA. The speaker also introduced the AptE RISC-V specification, which aims to become the reference architecture for confidential computing on RISC-V. They described the components of this architecture, including the TSM driver, TSM, and memory tracking table, and explained their roles and interactions in creating trusted virtual machines. The talk concluded by mentioning the challenges of implementing IO in confidential virtual machines.
