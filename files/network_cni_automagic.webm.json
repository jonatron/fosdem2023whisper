{"text": " Alright, thanks everybody for joining me today to talk about CNI automatic, making some use of some of this bike discovery for semantic network attachment in Kubernetes. My name is Doug. I maintain something called multi-CNI, which is a way to attach multiple network interfaces to causing Kubernetes, and I'm really interested in telco use cases for Kubernetes, especially. And I am going to talk a little bit about some mappings to make this semantic. So I thought I would show you a map of where I'm from, which is Vermont in the United States. If you're not familiar with it, you might be familiar with our two most famous exports, like our Bernie Sanders and Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I'll also put in a little size reference here of the Adirondacks, which will come in as a trivia later, and belt them, because they're all sort of similar sizes. So, yeah, what we're going to look at today is a problem statement for what I discovered. A tour of CNI plug-in that I developed to address that problem. And along with that, we're going to look at kind of like it's what I made is really a proof of concept to try to address that problem and what are the kind of limitations. But most of all, I want to show how this kind of thought process that I used plays into what I think is kind of some bigger picture of things that need to happen for the next version of CNI. So as we look at the problem statement, keep that in mind that there's this problem and there's a solution that I've got. It's a kernel of a solution. But we also want to look at this thought process because I think that it is more important than the solution that I've got. So, a lot of times in networking, we have these kind of ideals that everything's going to be mapped out and it's going to be perfect, but once you get on the ground floor, or maybe you've had this job before, sometimes your network really looks like this in the end. And at least for me, it's usually that we try to make everything as uniform and perfect as we can. In these diagrams, it'll look symmetrical. Everything will be like by a textbook. However, once you go to implement it, you discover that not everything is the same. Sometimes you have legacies in your systems. You might need to have some kind of non-sequitur type of things in your network, like a jump host, for example, or maybe you've got some vendor equipment that you've bought that just doesn't exactly match everything that was going to be part of your plan. And this is really where the problem starts for me is that I have people come to me and say, yeah, well, this would work if it was the same on every machine, but I've got one or two or 25 out of a thousand that just aren't the same. So really what it is is, okay, hey, I'm adding a secondary network to my pods, and I've got this definition of what it's supposed to be. And it references specific interfaces on my hosts, but in a non-uniform environment, it might just not match. So in this particular CNI configuration, which is tiny on there, I'm sorry, we have CNI configs that want to reference a specific interface that this is going to be created on. And that's, say, for example, ETH0. And sometimes we want to know, okay, yeah, it's ETH0, but what is actually the network that's behind that? Because as much as we can reference that interface, there's like a greater world beyond that. It's how it's connected to the rest of the network. So if I have a non-uniform environment and I'm going to have these CNI configurations where I've got, say, node1 has an ETH1, node2 has ENS2, ENS4, and those are all connected to green. The way that, like, a network attachment definition is that's what multi-CNI uses for a secondary network. When someone comes to me and says, I want to use this on this non-uniform network, I've got to tell them to make a configuration for each thing that's different. And then additionally, on top of that, again, it's too small and I apologize, but I've got to tell them to, yeah, well, make one for each node, but then make a pod that references that one and then uses a node selector. And then that way you can get the right configuration for the right pod associated with the right node. And it's just not a very Kubernetes way of doing things. Like, we want to express intent at a higher level and get away to get these things attached in a, like, easier to express way and not have to, like, baby it every little thing and say, it's like this stack of three things and they have to be associated to this node and I have to label this node. And I just wasn't happy with that. So really what I wanted is to say, instead of all of this stuff that I'm configuring with a CNI config in the pod and the nodes selector with the labeled node, I just want to say, I want it attached to the green network. That's really what I want. So I'm like, I want to, like, give some meaning to these network interfaces and make it so that I can scale on a non-uniform environment. So we use Kubernetes for scale. It's a great way to deploy workloads at scale. And we use CNI for plumbing our network interfaces in our pods. So as a CNI developer and as a Kubernetes developer, this is how I approach this problem. So I made something that I call Surveyor CNI. And it essentially maps devices to network names using CRDs, which are custom resource definitions. It's essentially a way to extend the Kubernetes API and to store data and have data that works in a way that, like, other Kubernetes applications can talk to. It's sort of like a lingua franca for CRDs. And also, I have, like, a number of projects that I've, like, named after, kind of, like, outdoor related things in my area. And I really was thinking of, like, this topographic engineer and, like, rad adventure guy named Verplank Colvin that was famous in the Adirondacks for the first thing. But the name Verplank Colvin doesn't flow off the tongue. So I'm like, all right, I'll call it Surveyor CNI. It essentially works in two phases. When the, when it's installed, it starts up a daemon set. And that daemon set has some go language scripts that just go and onto that node. And I say, all right, give me the network interfaces that are on that particular node. Then it creates an empty CRD that we can use to create a mapping association to go from network device name to network name itself. So in essence, what it does is I can have those two nodes with these all different names for the green network. And I can say, each one is green on node one. ENS2 is green on node two. And on node three, ENS4 is green. So that way, I can just say, thank you, I can say, all right, we want to attach to network green. In lieu of actually having a demo of this, I will challenge you to bring up the code and run it yourself. And I've got like a do it yourself kind of tutorial on the read me and I'll share the links with you. Otherwise, you'll just see the frustration of how to do it. So really, in a lot of ways, this is just sort of a like rolling chassis of a car that doesn't have an engine in it yet. Because it will make the custom resource for you and it will let you fill out those associations yourself. But I don't think that that really scales either. So I think that something that could really be improved here and because it uses custom resources is to have really an engine behind it, to have other Kubernetes controllers that know something further about your network. So for you to program some kind of intelligence into this, be able to do it. So like a working group that I'm part of that we call Kubernetes Network Plumbing Working Group, that comes up with all kinds of ideas about how to plumb your networks in Kubernetes. One of our like sort of, what's the word for it? I guess it's like the like holy grail kind of question is to ask the question, what network am I attaching to? And I think about that a lot and it makes me think of the question of, okay, hey, if I have this messy physical network environment with cables all over the place and I unplug a cable from one interface and into another in the physical world, then everything changes. And something that keeps coming up for me is this idea of can we listen to Netlink in Linux and build some more intelligence that happens like over the lifetime of a pod. And IPv6 usually comes up when we talk about this because in IPv6 you can have Slack, you can have router advertisement, so your IP addresses can be assigned kind of on the fly, your routes can change, your network can be changing, like these things are considered in IPv6. And I don't think that they're very well covered in Kubernetes in general and I think about that. I also was like, hey, if I have sort of this like high level way to express this, I'm like, could I train something that might know about this to sort of figure it out for me like an AI? If you haven't heard everyone talking about like the leaps and bounds in AI in the last like whatever, bring up social media and just see everyone talking about it. So I was like, yeah, maybe I could train like Chad GPT to do this. I realized that at this point it will probably just confidently make up something about my network. That's not actually true, but it seemed kind of sweet. Another question that came up when I was socializing this idea was, hey, why don't you just apply aliases to your network interfaces on the host? And I'm like, yeah, that's probably fine. And in fact, I would say if you have this problem today, this is probably what you should do instead of using my demo software because it's a really reliable way to do it. However, as a like CNI developer and as a Kubernetes developer, it's just not the way that I approach the problem. And it didn't really for me approach it in a way that exposes that data to something that can really be more of an engine behind this. So I think it's a good approach. I think that there's still something to be asked about scale here. So given that, let's think about some of the possible pitfalls here. Something in my space that gets brought up a lot when we talk about this variety of network tools is, are we going to wind up creating some kind of network manager like a neutron in OpenStack? And I think that there's a lot of problems that that exposes. And I think that it might also sort of like give some tunnel vision to the problems. And what I really like about how we approach networking in Kubernetes with CNI is we do this in a modular fashion. So with something like this idea of my survey or CNI, maybe it is a more of a modular way to approach it that's like, hey, here's one tool for this specific case. So if you don't encounter this problem, well then don't use this thing, right? And or if you do and you have a non-uniform environment, use something like Surveyor and get it to work for you or whatever, create Ansible scripts and make the aliases to your interfaces. Another pitfall of this as well is it doesn't cover how the workloads would be scheduled to nodes that have those devices available, right? So, you know, in my thing where I say network green, I really assume you're going to have a device mapping and association to the green network on every node. So if you have nodes that aren't attached to the green network, well, you need to know a way to approach that. And the way that we approach this problem today with a resource being available on a specific node is with something called device plugins. And what device plugins do is they give the Kubernetes scheduler awareness of consumable resources on a particular host. So if you've got, say, SROV network interfaces that are for high performance, your device plugin can know about that and tell Kubernetes that, hey, there are 15 virtual functions on this SROV card on this node. And that's how we approach that. So you could definitely extend my idea with adding device plugins, which are not super, super intuitive to use. And I think it's an area that also needs help in this space. But it would be a solution to work through that. So all of that being said, I'm kind of on a campaign to try to give people more awareness of what's going to happen with CNI 2.0. And if you are interested in this space at all, I encourage you to keep an eye on what's going on in the next version of CNI. We've got a number of problems that we really want to address. One of those is what happens to networking during a pod lifecycle. So, you know, I was mentioning, like, hey, what happens if I unplug this network and plug it in somewhere else? Like, can I detect that? Can I do something about that? Because right now, CNI works in essentially two different operations, which is add and delete. So when your network is added, CNI runs. When your pod is added, CNI runs. When your pod is deleted, CNI runs to clean it up. We want to have something that goes further through the lifecycle there. So, like, with IPv6 and ever-changing things, that can be covered. Maybe you can improve how, like, a cleanup happens because CNI delete isn't necessarily guaranteed. But the number one thing I think should happen with CNI 2.0 is that we have, like, more of a Kubernetes awareness for CNI 2.0. CNI is Container Orchestration Agnostic, which is an awesome start for it. But we only have one Container Orchestration Engine left, essentially, and it's Kubernetes. And I think it's important. So, yes, that being the case, this is how I approached it, right? I took this problem and I approached it with Kubernetes and with CNI, right? And I needed to kind of figure out how to, like, interact with all of these objects again when I made a new CNI plug-in. So I sort of, like, took a look at where I spent my time. And I spent it a lot during the, like, integration into Kubernetes. So, you know, I'm a CNI developer, so I spent a good chunk of the time on that. I spent a half-decent chunk on design, and I spent most of the time integrating it with Kubernetes. And I think that that could be improved. The X factor here was that I also used chatGBT to generate a bunch of my code. So maybe that also wasted my time. So there's that because it isn't always truthful of you. But, yeah, I want CNI 2.0 to communicate with Kubernetes. I think it's going to be a revolution in this phase. And I want everyone here that's interested in it to, like, get involved in this effort. And I think it's going to be, like, the next big thing for networking and Kubernetes. So, yeah, if you want, try it out. And that concludes what I've got. I can open it up for questions. Thank you. Have you considered using Linklayer Detection Price Go? Or Discovery, I can't remember. It actually stands for... Yeah, that's the one. Love it. I love that idea. I hadn't thought of it, but I am going to put that right in line with a Netlink thing. Yeah, I was just thinking about that as well. But isn't the problem that it finds layer 2 devices, your adjacency with the layer 2 device, not the layer 3? So I was wondering, would you be better to multi-cast from each, to also discover, have each device multi-cast what it thought and what name it gave to this network? The question then is how you ever assign the colors if you want to completely automate it. And maybe you have chat GPT assigned the colors for you. I like it. No, I think that's really good. Also, yeah, good consideration to the layer 2 versus layer 3. And, yeah, I think depending on your use case, it might end with your network. But I know in the telco world, there's a lot of LTE networks, for sure. Yes. Yeah, I think the next device T is going to block the LDP. So you'll only see that neighbor. You won't see the other nodes on that subnet. That was more my issue. That's what you want to find out, right? Yeah. It could give you the B line if that's your network separation. Yeah, yeah, it could do. Yeah, I think it merits consideration for sure. Any other questions? No? Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you all.
