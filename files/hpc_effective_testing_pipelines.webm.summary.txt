The talk is about developing effective testing pipelines for HPC applications. The speaker talks about their background and experience in the HPC industry and explains the motivation behind developing testing pipelines. They discuss the challenges they faced in testing provisioning scripts and the desire for reproducibility in testing. They introduce a custom testing framework called CleanTest that allows for the easy testing of HPC applications on different operating systems and hypervisors. The speaker explains the different parts of CleanTest, including the bootstrap and configuration stage, testlets, and evaluation and reporting. They also discuss the current limitations of CleanTest and extend an invitation for involvement and feedback. The talk concludes with a Q&A session.
