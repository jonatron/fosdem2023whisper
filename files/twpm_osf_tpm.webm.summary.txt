The speaker discusses the Trustworthy Platform Module (TWPM) project, which aims to make TPMs more trust-worthy by providing open source firmware. They explain the challenges of working with different TPM modules and connectors, and how they started the project with a focus on firmware. They discuss the hardware and software challenges they have encountered, and their roadmap for the project, including implementing different interfaces, testing, and improvements to the TPM stack. They also mention the need for unique identification and entropy, and potential FPGA usage. The speaker invites interested individuals to join their communication channels and contribute to the project. During the Q&A, they discuss timing issues, potential FPGA options, and the security of the firmware.
