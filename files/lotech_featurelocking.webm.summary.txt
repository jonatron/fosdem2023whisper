The talk is about a feature called "feature restrictions and feature locking" that was developed by Pranam within Collab Online. It is an additional option for any CIS admin to hide or lock a set of features, such as formatting options or system resources usage, from users. The feature locking feature adds a lock icon and prompts the user to upgrade their hosting account to access locked features. The feature is switched on and off using two keywords in cool WSTXML, making it a simple and easy process. The talk provides examples of how the feature works, including restricting or locking formatting options.
