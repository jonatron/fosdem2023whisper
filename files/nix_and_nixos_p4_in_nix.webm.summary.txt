The speaker, Govah, begins by introducing themselves and thanking the MLNet Foundation and the European Commission for sponsoring their research. They then go on to explain that they will be discussing P4, which stands for "Programming Protocol Independent Packet Processor," a domain-specific language for network devices. They describe P4 as a hardware-optimized network processing tool that uses a syntax similar to C. They explain the concepts of parser, control, and package functions in P4, which handle packet processing, modifying packet data, and defining hardware bindings respectively. The speaker then presents their idea of creating a transpiler that allows code to be written in NICS and automatically generates P4 code, which can be further processed by a P4 compiler and a target compiler to be deployed on various platforms such as FPGAs and DPUs. They demonstrate how the transpiler works and explain that they are also working on hardware definitions for FPGAs and other deployment mechanisms. The speaker concludes by mentioning that while P4 is primarily used for networking, some aspects of their work could be useful for other applications. In the Q&A session, they briefly discuss the applicability of P4 to non-network streams and demonstrate a secure boot feature they have been working on.
