In this talk, Fernando, a software engineer at Drehat, discussed the transition from Python to Rust when building a network management tool called NMS State. The team learned Rust while developing NISPOR, a simpler tool than NMS State, and used the Rust networking library Rastnet Link to communicate with Neville Manager, as well as Rust serialization and deserialization libraries to handle user input. The team also provided C, Python and Goland bindings, and re-used the Python integration tests to ensure compatibility. Ultimately, they were successful with the transition and were surprised by the ease and availability of Rust resources.
