This talk explored the FOSBOT project, which was started as an open source software robot and has evolved into a tool designed for educators in various educational levels. The presentation explored the hardware and design of the robot, which is 3D printable, offers customization and uses common electronics. It also explored the software capabilities of the robot, with three different levels of programming, ranging from beginners to advanced users, as well as its integration with the Coppelia SIM simulation environment. Finally, it discussed its use in higher education venues such as through advanced algorithms, machine learning and data management.
