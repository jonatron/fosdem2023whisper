The speaker discusses performance optimization for voice over IP services, using a real-life example of poor performance due to the use of an exec module and Perl script. They suggest areas to look for performance issues, such as CPU, memory, and IO, and offer examples of tools and modules to use, such as the htable module for caching data and custom tools for testing databases and APIs. They also mention common tools for monitoring CPU, IO, and network performance, as well as benchmarks modules and logging adaptations in Camelio. The speaker also promotes the upcoming Camelio World conference in Berlin.
