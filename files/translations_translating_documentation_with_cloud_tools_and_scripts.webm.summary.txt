In this talk, Nilo Menezes discussed the process he developed for translating a NIN document for Python developers in various languages, using various cloud tools and scripts. He discussed how he used markdown, PO files, and an automatic translation engine to create a smooth workflow for translating the document. The workflow also included features to detect repetitions and consider language-specific keywords in source code.
