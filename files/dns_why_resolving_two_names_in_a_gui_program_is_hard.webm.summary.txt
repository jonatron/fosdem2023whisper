The speaker, Peter Menzik, discussed why resolving two names in a single program is not simple, specifically in graphic applications that use event-based loops. While existing solutions such as get other info call and asynchronous libraries like DNS work, they are limiting and often block. The speaker proposes a non-blocking solution by creating a common code to implement protocol-specific plugins, including DNS and other naming systems, and rewriting existing modules to use callbacks to make resolution simpler for non-trivial applications while conserving CPU. The speaker admits that there is no implementation yet and suggests that Red Hat may lead this initiative in the free desktop space. Questions were raised regarding enhancing existing solutions like get DNS and whether each plugin needs to handle TLS.
