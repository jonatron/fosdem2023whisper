The talk was about managing open-source databases using Canonical's open-source operator, Juju. Juju is used to build operators for databases and abstracts the backing clouds, helping to automate operations around databases such as scaling, backups, and upgrades. The talk focused on the efforts and progress of building the operator for MySQL using MySQL Shell, MySQL Router, Percona extra backup, and Percona monitoring tools. The current version of the operator provides automatic deployment, scaling, and self-healing, but the team plans to work on resource phasing, observability, and architecture improvements. The Juju operator acts as an orchestration layer between the user and the system and can work equally well on open-stack and Kubernetes.
