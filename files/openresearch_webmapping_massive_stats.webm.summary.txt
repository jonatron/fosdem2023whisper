The speaker, Etienne Combe, discussed a project he worked on eight years ago involving a massive statistical dataset derived from tax sheets, called Don√© Caroyer. The distribution of this dataset was difficult due to the file formats and projection problems, which were solved using web mapping stacks developed around the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. The speaker and his team created a web-based tool for exploring and visualizing statistical data using vector tiles, which solved the modifiable area unit problem and allowed for different aggregation scales. The tool received positive feedback from INSEE, journalists, transportation researchers, and others. The speaker also discussed the maturation of technology and standardization of vector tiles and front-end solutions like Mapbox GL. There was a discussion about the meaning of vector tiles and the potential for an official portai for INSEE in the future. The speaker also mentioned European initiatives and a JavaScript library developed by Eurostat for showing graded statistical data.
