[00:00.000 --> 00:12.420]  Hello, my name is Jonathan McHugh and I am from Icebreaker and I'm just going to be going
[00:12.420 --> 00:19.980]  through some of the design decisions in regards to my project as well as express some thoughts
[00:19.980 --> 00:30.980]  regarding knowledge management and the use of abstract symbols as a way of working with
[00:30.980 --> 00:41.340]  projects to maximise flow and improve interoperability and reduce the time and costs of expressing
[00:41.340 --> 00:50.220]  concepts and expectations and desires and unleashing them as actions and what not.
[00:50.220 --> 00:58.260]  And this is a diagram which I playfully did which just sort of explains some of the facets
[00:58.260 --> 01:07.260]  with regards to it. Before I really got into coding I had a varied experience with regards to
[01:08.180 --> 01:16.980]  information society from a wider perspective and one of the things which I found was very useful
[01:16.980 --> 01:27.980]  for dealing with large information apparatus was to use abstract symbols. I did this for an
[01:27.980 --> 01:37.180]  association whereby I was collecting different tags and for from DeliciousV which was a social
[01:37.180 --> 01:44.660]  bookmarking system from back in the day and what I did was the focus on me and tax on me as I
[01:44.660 --> 01:49.620]  was collecting were getting so large it was getting it would have been uneconomic to use for
[01:49.620 --> 01:58.980]  instance just the lettering of the terms and it was better to aggregate them and what I did
[01:58.980 --> 02:09.780]  was make use of the non-alpha numeric characters which formed the which usually on the right hand
[02:09.780 --> 02:18.660]  side of a keyboard sometimes at the top as well and I found that this was very good for both
[02:18.660 --> 02:26.100]  demarcating things but it also sort of created more of an impetus regarding how to order things
[02:26.180 --> 02:33.060]  and the gains from say doing completions was fantastic because you weren't really just cycling
[02:33.060 --> 02:38.260]  through all the letters of the word to get the the form you wanted but you just sort of smash
[02:38.260 --> 02:44.100]  in and deal with the the term because you've got an associated character or combination of
[02:44.100 --> 02:53.820]  characters and one of the things when I really got into programming I started out by really
[02:53.860 --> 03:05.020]  prioritising things like tech, the documentation system, VIM, the text editor and as well as sort
[03:05.020 --> 03:14.020]  of using regular expressions by the tooling said as well as AUK and I tried to I tried to use the
[03:14.020 --> 03:25.620]  existing characters and that I had from the syntax for delineating the the the the terms and
[03:25.620 --> 03:30.140]  definitions which I was trying to collect in terms of programming but what I found was that it
[03:30.140 --> 03:37.860]  didn't quite match because the the association which had previously formed my my my my things
[03:37.860 --> 03:48.060]  were from were from they were dealing with a public affairs politics and cultural activities and
[03:48.060 --> 03:59.300]  even though it dealt upon the the even though it dealt upon the technology aspects such as peer
[03:59.300 --> 04:05.220]  to peer or things like that it didn't really delve into it it was really at the kind of so
[04:05.220 --> 04:14.260]  they're kind of white shirt level in terms of expectations competences and I realised that I
[04:14.260 --> 04:23.020]  needed something something better suited for what happens within a computer environment and and what
[04:23.020 --> 04:29.900]  what though what the components are and how they interlace and spent a lot of dog food eating trying
[04:29.900 --> 04:36.180]  to work out a form so I'm just going to go through some of the aspects with regards to this and I
[04:36.180 --> 04:43.260]  purposely chose something very abstract but also accessible I chose it abstract because I was aware
[04:43.260 --> 04:49.420]  with regards to semantic business process management which was an attempt which is an approach to
[04:49.420 --> 04:58.380]  mitigate groups from different language communities with with with common terms and for me an abstract
[04:58.620 --> 05:07.380]  seemed to be quite quite useful because it would be cultural neutral and I subsequently found that
[05:07.380 --> 05:12.580]  the ambiguity is quite useful because it allows you to do things quickly without being too bothered
[05:12.580 --> 05:20.100]  and actually there there was a there's turns out there's interesting psychological advantages from
[05:20.100 --> 05:26.660]  breaking things down into a certain unit of things so for instance I was reading that it takes seven
[05:26.700 --> 05:34.820]  forms that in fact whatever things are roughly people can put things into seven boxes so expecting
[05:34.820 --> 05:40.260]  the number of cows of a field there's a variance which happens with around seven in terms of people
[05:40.260 --> 05:45.420]  and expectations as well as expectations with bitterness and some people can be more precise
[05:45.420 --> 05:51.420]  and more accurate and there's just a kind of a deviation in terms of that once you look in the
[05:51.460 --> 05:58.980]  numbers of recollection and what people can hold and interpret in certain things I fixated on the
[05:58.980 --> 06:09.860]  number six so in effect I classified the Vim tooling which I was dealing with with a roughly
[06:09.860 --> 06:22.260]  between 1, 2, 3, 4, well it was 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 which and I subsequently expanded upon that
[06:22.260 --> 06:31.380]  with the realizing that things things wouldn't deal with it needed a bit more subtlety so in
[06:31.420 --> 06:38.660]  effect the first tier was used to delineate whether something 10 which was something which was
[06:38.660 --> 06:51.500]  which was which was which was something which was personally dealt with 20 to deal with documentation
[06:51.500 --> 06:58.500]  30 to deal with display 40 to deal with movement 50 to do with environments such as conflicts and
[06:58.820 --> 07:06.180]  60 to do with external or system-wide things or external tooling and I subsequently adapted this
[07:06.180 --> 07:16.980]  for two level layer with regards to 1q10 to represent one facet 1q30 to represent another
[07:18.100 --> 07:24.020]  and this sort of played well in terms of things but I just sort of had a bit of a
[07:24.660 --> 07:32.580]  I had a guilt in it because the non- that the previous system I came up with had the
[07:34.020 --> 07:38.260]  it worked very nicely that the you could describe things with the
[07:39.460 --> 07:43.620]  with the non-alpha numerics and they're quite accessible on the keyboard and so after a while
[07:43.620 --> 07:50.420]  with my confidence at least in terms of how I was dealing with the annotations in terms of
[07:50.580 --> 07:57.460]  the putting putting subsets of content which is quite similar into a specific folder
[07:58.420 --> 08:06.100]  with these annotations forming and dealing with things and so for instance I would end up with
[08:06.500 --> 08:22.820]  something looking like this which was compounded and so I started using the the letters sort of in
[08:22.820 --> 08:33.940]  the home row in the middle of where the QWERTY keyboard was so and it was it encouraged me to
[08:33.940 --> 08:39.220]  really have things in specialized forms and repositories and I took the philosophy really
[08:39.220 --> 08:45.700]  sort of spreading things out so for instance we look at this this is an example of
[08:49.620 --> 09:00.420]  of different roughly passing based activities and I could do another form and so HQH would be
[09:00.420 --> 09:05.860]  roughly around passing OQ would be represented of languages and tools
[09:10.260 --> 09:11.940]  and so for instance we could do
[09:15.380 --> 09:19.540]  lower and this would give an example of lots of lower based
[09:22.100 --> 09:27.220]  points so as you can see these annotations can allow you to really cut through and deal with
[09:27.220 --> 09:34.900]  various points and with the with regards to the icebreaker project I felt that the
[09:36.980 --> 09:43.300]  I felt this stuff was interesting but the icebreaker project was very document
[09:43.300 --> 09:53.540]  focused for very good reasons the my icebreaker project was has been looking into how document
[09:53.860 --> 10:01.380]  how flap based files could be used particularly with regards to gem text the file format of gem
[10:01.380 --> 10:10.260]  and I could be used to express issues and problems or also Kanban boards which is
[10:13.460 --> 10:20.740]  which would be more preferable than the walled garden approach of services such as Github
[10:20.740 --> 10:26.420]  where you in effect end up putting all your repos with all the git history and all the subtleties
[10:26.420 --> 10:30.900]  in terms of that but when it comes to improving any of these repos you're not allowed to
[10:32.020 --> 10:39.700]  delve through the history and subtleties in terms of that so here's just at the top pane an example of
[10:40.500 --> 10:48.740]  and G networks Kanban board repo just the read me file being run through
[10:49.700 --> 10:57.460]  a the git in terms of the history and diffs so as you see all of these lovely things in terms
[10:57.460 --> 11:01.940]  of people adding things people removing things people altering things you don't really get in
[11:01.940 --> 11:17.300]  Github and that's a shame I sort of looked in terms of that and it was very satisfying that
[11:17.300 --> 11:25.620]  gem text could provide such a minimal minimal syntactic range for expressing the ideas that
[11:26.180 --> 11:32.820]  that ultimately I felt the need that just to see how things could mix and and perform with and what I
[11:32.820 --> 11:42.900]  went with was the use of the KL liner format which is within the emacs hyper hyperbole the package
[11:42.900 --> 11:48.100]  which is a format which is hierarchical and it's got very good interfaces so for instance
[11:48.260 --> 11:57.140]  you could be adding parts like this or hitting a child form and what's very nice is as part of this
[11:57.140 --> 12:05.700]  being a person information manager so you can cross link blocks and if including in other
[12:05.700 --> 12:14.980]  documents and should the blocks change then you will be able to you'll be able to catch up and
[12:14.980 --> 12:20.980]  work out where that the block has been moved to at least within the same document and so that's
[12:20.980 --> 12:28.580]  one of the things which I really prioritized and dealt with in terms of this year and and I managed
[12:28.580 --> 12:38.100]  to with the interpreter canonical mix both the syntaxes of gem protocols gem text the KL liner
[12:38.100 --> 12:48.660]  format as well as the key annotation system and so this has and I haven't explored it perfectly
[12:48.660 --> 12:53.700]  but I believe that the passing expression grammars are capable of representing things
[12:55.540 --> 12:58.260]  within the same line and not necessarily be relegated to
[13:00.420 --> 13:07.700]  to comparing line by line and so this kind of deviant exploration of how syntaxes
[13:07.700 --> 13:15.220]  can work across I've potentially got something much more richer and and subtle with with then
[13:15.220 --> 13:18.580]  then the formats and syntaxes isolated
[13:22.740 --> 13:30.260]  here just on the top pane here is just an example of in in the in the language and
[13:30.260 --> 13:38.260]  pass a txr a way of creating a definition and then providing the name of the reference in this
[13:38.260 --> 13:49.620]  case I use the annotation style hqh to just point out that the the passing forms and and here we have
[13:49.620 --> 14:02.580]  the the various key key aspects uh aspects of the of the annotation um for for key just
[14:02.580 --> 14:09.780]  returning to that I should emphasize that that the key annotation is formed around the the
[14:10.420 --> 14:17.940]  green buttons which would either so for instance and it would be one of the one of the letters
[14:17.940 --> 14:25.060]  in there would generate would providing the the starting kernel for for an annotation but it is
[14:25.860 --> 14:32.340]  supplemented with qwe or two which allows to provide a an inference and this was more of a
[14:32.340 --> 14:42.020]  later stage innovation and you can also combine annotations the annotation points at least I do
[14:42.020 --> 14:49.300]  it so that up to four can be compounded to be representative of of one which excluding blooms
[14:49.300 --> 14:56.500]  which would be providing where the dictionary where the document deals with and encourages more
[14:56.500 --> 15:03.940]  recursive perspective on things has has a very large range permutative range which even though
[15:03.940 --> 15:11.220]  that wouldn't be satisfied with either an individual annotating things or or a community left alone
[15:11.220 --> 15:18.500]  the the logical outcome of combining certain things together it provides a very large range in
[15:18.500 --> 15:26.340]  the tens if not hundreds of thousands of of of points and so as you add one or more annotations
[15:26.340 --> 15:33.380]  you can really get a fingerprint of what things are and it's also got a bit subtlety regarding
[15:33.380 --> 15:39.380]  that it's not the lack of precision in terms of this which has been described to me more in terms of
[15:40.100 --> 15:47.380]  like I think it was Aristotle's use of hexes in terms of what something is and and its sort of
[15:48.580 --> 15:56.580]  force the philosophy of what something is and I've been trying to deliberate in terms of the
[15:57.620 --> 16:00.900]  the subtleties regarding that and I guess it would be for instance
[16:02.580 --> 16:08.900]  there's there's always conjecture regarding who invents say the first submarine or the or say
[16:08.900 --> 16:17.220]  something like the first submarine or the first first the first camera and so for instance from
[16:17.220 --> 16:24.420]  my own perspective in terms of prejudices I've got a concept of of an Irishman inventing the first
[16:24.420 --> 16:35.780]  submarine and London a London an English politician who was invented the first camera and that's
[16:35.780 --> 16:42.980]  perhaps just based on my own prejudices upbringing and me not having complete enough technological
[16:42.980 --> 16:46.580]  perspective and definition in terms of that and I'm sure there are people for instance and
[16:47.540 --> 16:53.060]  in other regions who who have different opinions and that's all fine because we all sort of have
[16:53.060 --> 16:58.340]  a common idea of what a submarine is or what a camera is but we might have different definitions
[16:58.340 --> 17:04.820]  at which point that thing moved from being something else into that form and that's why I like the
[17:06.740 --> 17:13.700]  the vagueness of this key and and its annotations is that it it doesn't it doesn't have grandiose
[17:13.700 --> 17:19.220]  claims of completeness and it has more of a kind of ectomology approach in which you can
[17:19.940 --> 17:26.820]  make an opinion on things switching out and it's all fine including if if the definitions changes
[17:26.820 --> 17:32.660]  and it's it's almost in terms of how it works and and operates in terms of the work for any
[17:32.660 --> 17:38.180]  user it really gives you kind of the convenience and dealing with things so just returning back to
[17:38.180 --> 17:49.460]  here for instance I looking in terms of a a more of a specific function at the top here you've got
[17:49.460 --> 17:57.940]  RQR KWK and that's in effect RQR would be a form of a to-do and KWK in terms of hashes in terms
[17:57.940 --> 18:07.540]  of the aspects the complementary description is create hashes and here we're just returning just
[18:07.540 --> 18:16.900]  in case you there's a definite the function definition as well as a reference in terms of the
[18:16.900 --> 18:25.700]  fact that you have the annotations being being outputted here within the the parentheses here
[18:25.700 --> 18:38.100]  just in the light blue and here we have the the form for putting things in cases which in
[18:38.100 --> 18:45.860]  in the TXR form needs to be ended this is a list based language so as you can imagine things start
[18:45.860 --> 18:53.380]  and stop in very clear forms you have the syntax for creating a binding which in this form would be
[18:53.380 --> 19:01.060]  well let's let's go the first part so this is you this is an example of a URI variable being
[19:01.060 --> 19:08.500]  captured which is referencing a separate function and which and and expecting this outcome and of
[19:08.500 --> 19:15.620]  course you might have you could have a function capturing multiple things and which this this
[19:15.620 --> 19:20.020]  approach could capture different points and at least my interpretation regarding why I'm doing
[19:20.020 --> 19:27.220]  this binding is because it allows it seemingly allowing you to inherit all the subtleties upstream
[19:27.220 --> 19:32.420]  in terms of that but I might be a bit flaky in terms of that so as you can imagine there are
[19:32.420 --> 19:39.700]  sort of lots of different forms and and and dealing with things and here's an example of a of one of
[19:39.700 --> 19:48.980]  the of the forms which would have the with a here classic regular expression style things in terms of
[19:48.980 --> 19:55.780]  repeating numbers and various points and so just to give an example of how I could sort of use these
[19:55.780 --> 20:09.540]  annotations for right sort of racing through things so here is an example of RQR which would be
[20:10.340 --> 20:20.580]  a mechanism for just pulling up all of my to-dos and here you have yeah it's referencing the fact
[20:20.580 --> 20:25.220]  that there are 202 different tasks and dealing with things and obviously this is just providing
[20:25.220 --> 20:32.500]  a document type a singular document but you could be for instance performing a search based upon
[20:32.500 --> 20:38.500]  multiple documents or within the project which within this emacs operating environment means that
[20:39.460 --> 20:46.340]  you're pretty much just limited by time and ambition so for instance you could
[20:49.460 --> 20:51.940]  as you can see it's very terse
[20:58.580 --> 21:06.260]  and this is this is how this is for me quite significant in terms of flying by I I really
[21:06.820 --> 21:13.060]  really try and make sure that I have maximum flow and that I can switch from one mental state to
[21:13.060 --> 21:20.740]  another and and and handle multiple things without being overwhelmed and for instance the name that
[21:20.740 --> 21:27.380]  the fact that the documents and the and the directories have to have named in terms of that
[21:27.380 --> 21:31.940]  means that it makes it easier for instance jumping for a different file so for instance if I press
[21:32.660 --> 21:36.580]  ctrl x and b in emacs then there's a range of
[21:40.660 --> 21:47.940]  point so if just pressing mqm here for instance has given me a list of different
[21:47.940 --> 21:55.140]  buffers and and the names in terms of that so it I can really sort of come up with
[21:55.700 --> 22:01.460]  buttons and hotkeys and actions and to deal with that so for instance here's just a way in in terms
[22:01.460 --> 22:08.020]  of the reuse of these annotations can come can be dealt with so for instance at the top we have
[22:08.020 --> 22:16.820]  svge tag mode which is an third party emacs library which allows you to turn various points
[22:18.980 --> 22:25.140]  in terms of these black and white boxes are the annotations I would like to say improved
[22:25.140 --> 22:30.820]  or visualized but you can also add other things in terms of that I've talked in other activities
[22:30.820 --> 22:40.100]  regarding the the use of hyper hyper hyperbole the in terms of navigation and
[22:42.500 --> 22:48.180]  and points in terms of that so this time I thought I'd just look at one of the latest features from
[22:48.180 --> 22:54.820]  number eight version eight which is defil which provides more a regular expression based form
[22:54.820 --> 23:02.180]  in terms of that so this form would be the defining of the function the name of this function the
[23:02.980 --> 23:12.660]  the opening context the middle context at the ending context as well as the middle context
[23:12.660 --> 23:18.020]  as well as what you're meant to do based upon that within these within these curly parentheses
[23:18.260 --> 23:25.860]  so what I've what I what is what is the conjecture in terms of this one is the fact that
[23:25.860 --> 23:28.820]  within a specific annotation you could be having
[23:31.780 --> 23:37.940]  different actions based upon where the cursor is within the annotation let alone the potential in
[23:37.940 --> 23:44.660]  terms of any perspective before or afterwards and this is quite deep because of the use of
[23:44.660 --> 23:49.780]  repeativeness and various forms that you could form very complex workflows not necessarily from
[23:50.660 --> 24:00.820]  key bindings pulling out the the the the things and and the or the use of classic my
[24:01.940 --> 24:09.780]  menus but in fact you could use the the cursor within or relative to a one of these annotations
[24:09.860 --> 24:14.580]  and that forms the the action which could get very fast in terms of just pushing about it
[24:15.380 --> 24:20.580]  having a dedicated action in in terms of the styles dedicated action button for dealing with
[24:20.580 --> 24:24.740]  things and so the the menu would in effect be the cursor related to the
[24:28.900 --> 24:34.980]  and here's a high roll of format which is within the hyperbole suite which looks into things
[24:35.940 --> 24:42.100]  and that's very interesting which I'll be looking into more so for instance an action could be to
[24:43.540 --> 24:49.540]  go to a subset of this for instance this is an example of the section shells which has the
[24:49.540 --> 24:53.940]  subsection and I haven't really I don't really have the time to go into this further but there's a
[24:53.940 --> 25:04.660]  recent emacs conference where this is one of the main talking points here is a here is a product
[25:04.660 --> 25:12.100]  of a script which I think is about 50 gigabytes or might be maybe this is a 20 50 or 20 megabytes
[25:12.820 --> 25:21.460]  which is an effect a rip grip through various points and and and and and dealing with the
[25:22.660 --> 25:27.300]  this this is a and trying to isolate various various things so let's
[25:28.260 --> 25:36.740]  so let's just highlight some colors quickly we'll just do that let's see pink yeah
[25:38.260 --> 25:44.420]  well that's probably slowing it down but whatever but in effect it's classic rip grip answers
[25:45.780 --> 25:51.380]  which document which line which character what was dealt with in here I'm just running through the
[25:51.380 --> 25:56.500]  entire system the entire file system to find the annotations pertinent
[25:58.580 --> 26:06.980]  ah but yeah there we go so um but we'll use swiper to reinforce
[26:07.940 --> 26:25.380]  so this will ah this will have the aggregate of it's got it does have duplicates at least how
[26:25.380 --> 26:34.660]  this was set up but that's fine because the outputs dealing with the orderly fashion in terms of that
[26:34.660 --> 26:41.380]  so ascertain is it come on
[26:43.940 --> 26:50.420]  sorry the uh I think my computer's a bit overwhelmed it's humming a bit but there must be
[26:50.420 --> 26:56.740]  some background thing yes so here we go so we've got ascertaining ascertain whether in correct location
[27:05.140 --> 27:10.580]  that ascertain wherever useful nothing links to it and as you can I I do have
[27:12.180 --> 27:19.540]  I do have tooling which sort of deals of this from the point of a specific script and I've
[27:19.540 --> 27:26.660]  I've worked out a way to in effect inject the annotations based upon hashing of content
[27:26.660 --> 27:32.260]  I've also been developing the hash trees forming with regards to the documents
[27:33.140 --> 27:41.060]  but yes um I hope this is of interest and yeah there's there's lots of interesting
[27:41.060 --> 27:46.340]  things with regards to icebreaker and I guess it would be best to visit the
[27:47.060 --> 27:52.900]  fostering page for this talk for some more supplementary information thank you very much
[28:02.260 --> 28:03.640]  you
