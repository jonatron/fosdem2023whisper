The talk discusses Cilium Service Mesh, which is built on the Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (EBPF) technology. The speaker explains that Cilium uses EBPF to attach programs to kernel events related to networking, allowing for metrics collection, load balancing, and other networking capabilities. The speaker emphasizes the goal of reducing operational complexity by moving away from sidecars and leveraging the kernel-level capabilities of EBPF. They also mention the features and upcoming releases of Cilium, such as support for Gateway API, TLS termination, HTTP traffic splitting, and multiple ingresses per load balancer. The talk concludes with a demo showcasing how to configure and use Cilium Service Mesh.
