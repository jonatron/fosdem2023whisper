The talk discusses the development of a reasoning engine called FODOT, which aims to enable machines to reason and solve problems using natural language. The speaker explains that existing programming languages such as Prolog are not suitable for representing knowledge and proposes the use of a first-order logic language called FODOT, which has simple semantics and the ability to express complex forms of knowledge. The speaker also introduces a reasoning engine called IDPZ3, which can perform various reasoning tasks such as model checking, model generation, and explanation. The speaker presents examples of how the technology has been applied in various domains, such as reducing decision time for experts and empowering younger engineers to find proper designs. The speaker concludes by highlighting the advancements in solvers and the new understanding of knowledge, which make it possible to develop these technologies.
