The talk was about the standardization of elliptic curves in free software and the challenges that arise with new cryptography techniques. The speaker suggests standardizing a variety of elliptic curves rather than fixing one in a specific way, allowing for more flexibility in choosing curves. They also discussed the Jacobi Quartik curve, which can lead to faster and smaller signatures, but may still be larger than other signature methods. The speaker also briefly mentions jealous two curves and hyper elliptic curves.
