The talk discusses how browsers can be connected to larger networks and become first-class citizens in networked applications. The speaker introduces the Lippe-to-Pee networking library, which provides low-level features for encryption, authentication, and hole-punching. The talk then goes through different scenarios of connecting public and private nodes, both browser and non-browser platforms, using web sockets, web transport, and WebRTC to establish a byte stream between endpoints. The speaker concludes that connecting browsers to networks is possible and encourages considering the architecture on the right (direct browser-to-network communication) versus the traditional architecture on the left (browser communicating through a server).
