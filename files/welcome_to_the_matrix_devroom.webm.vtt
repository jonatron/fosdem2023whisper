00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Welcome to the first ever in real life matrix dev room.

00:12.000 --> 00:21.000
Who would have thought we would get there when we came here for the first time in 2015?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Honestly, a little bit of a surprise.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
But hey, this is really cool that we're back in one physical place at last after these three years of being stuck in matrix.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
So we have to do this bit because people might either be really lost in the room right now,

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
or they might be viewing this online and have no idea what they're getting into.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
So Avondine, what is matrix?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
So as you can read, it's an open network for secure and decentralized real-time communications.

00:51.000 --> 01:00.000
A lot of you probably know it for chat and voiceover IP, but we can do many things on matrix as we will see today.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
Of course, the chat, the voiceover IP, IOT and then VR, 3D worlds, etc.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
And we should probably introduce ourselves.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
I'm Matthew, I'm the technical project leads and co-founder.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
And I'm Avondine, I'm a matrix co-founder.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
Basically, the responsible person who tries to keep everything on track and let me play with computers.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
So our mission, slightly changing it this year actually, because I think we're kind of converging on matrix,

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
trying to be the real-time communication layer of the open web.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
It's kind of the idea all along and it's under the bit over the top to put it in writing when we began.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
But the reality is increasingly that's where things are moving towards.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
You can say that I know activity pub is more of a real-time micro-blogging or information sharing layer, RSS and steroids.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
Whereas with matrix, we're really trying to go as low latency as we will be talking about in a few minutes.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
And sort of real-time instant messaging, whatever on top.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
So the way it works, we said decentralized, we didn't lie.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
A bunch of servers who can talk to one another, a bunch of clients attached to the servers in green on the graph.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
But the key thing with matrix, it's called matrix for a reason.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
It's because it's matrixing all the different networks out there.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
There is when we created it, we didn't think everyone would jump on it like this.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
We thought that the interesting and the intelligent thing to do is probably to connect all the existing things so everyone could benefit from it.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
The name matrix came from basically a conversation where we said, hey, it would be really cool if there was a name like matrix

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
that we could use to describe this kind of substrate in which all these different things could be embedded.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Like matrix comes from Latin, where it means uterus, where things grow, where you go and embed things.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
And it's where the word mother and matron comes from and maternal.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
And we thought that would be a pretty cool thing to kind of describe the idea of linking it all together.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
But no, we obviously couldn't call it matrix because of the film.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Then we realized that the film came out 15 years earlier and that was already what, eight years ago.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
And so for, hey, we'll use it anyway.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
And we did. And also matrix.org used to be a really nasty website and so it was available.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
What are the stats looking like?

03:26.000 --> 03:34.000
Basically, there has been 87 million users registered in the whole matrix network until today.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
So it's growing quite nicely.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
The thing is, these are only users we can see and know of.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
So a whole bunch of them are probably just hiding into big closed network which are not connected and never talk to us.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah, so I mean, just for full transparency on this graph, which we show a lot.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
And it's obvious, I mean, the important thing is the shape of the graph rather than necessarily the absolute numbers.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Because this is actually based on the phone home stats that Synapse has in it.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
So there aren't any dandrites or constructs or conduits and flying around in here.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Also, it is literally total MX IDs that server has ever seen.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
So it is including bridged users, it's including guests, et cetera.

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
And the way to think of it is that literally half of these are actually bridged and then about another half of them are guests.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
So if you wanted the non-guest actually registered fully signed up users, it's possibly reducing it by a quarter.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
But we prefer the bigger number.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Sometimes it's going to be larger than the number of humans on the planet and then it's going to start looking a little bit awkward.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
It still means it's people you can talk to on matrix if they're connected, but so yeah, they're actual users.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
So I think for one, we'll be reaching out to guests 4445442 on matrix.org from September 2013.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
The other small stat on the corner is across at least 100,000 deployments, again, that we know of,

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
and it ranges from Raspberry Pis, which I'm sure many of you have in the room, all the way up to matrix.org.

05:02.000 --> 05:10.000
And it's like 13, 14 million users and when the middle servers for enterprises, governments and anyone basically,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
all sorts of sites.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
And again, disclaimer on the stat here for 100,000 servers.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
This is based on looking at the destinations table on matrix.org, which is about 50,000 at the moment,

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
and doubling it based on the number of servers which we can't see out there on the network.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
So who uses it?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm going to seriously go through all of these logos.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
We've only got like three minutes before Jan Rubby tackles us off the stage.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
Well, we've put just a bunch of logos out there. So obviously, yes, I hope you've been following fast them on matrix.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
And hello to everyone out there who is currently streaming from matrix.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
So we're always very proud to be hosting fast them waves to the camera. Hello.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
I was looking for it and a whole bunch of different projects that hopefully,

05:57.000 --> 06:05.000
you know, a whole bunch of cluster of governments out there who made the right choice and went for data sovereignty.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
I mean, it's a bit crazy that I mean, we've missed out some of the sort of companies who we know use it.

06:11.000 --> 06:21.000
But honestly, a large number are like governments, whether that's France or Germany, Germany, again, UK, NATO, Luxembourg, Sweden, Ukraine,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
or open source projects.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
It's not the most obvious mix, but there's a huge footprint obviously on both sides,

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
but also a bunch of companies obviously probably including people in the room using it to apologize if your local country is not on here.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
And if it isn't on here, but you don't use matrix, stop using teams and get on board.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
In terms of vital stats, where to start?

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Colgen.io. If people don't know Colgen.io, it's really good.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
You basically just give it a get hub or a get lab repository.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I'm sorry, organization. And it goes on spiders.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
The whole thing puts an elastic search and gives you the elastic search kind of credentials to go in and do whatever you want with the stats.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
So this is looking at it from 2014 with a number of committers, number of issues and reviews.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm not sure what happened with our reviews in 2020, but there was a mad reviewing frenzy.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
COVID.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Oh yeah, yeah, people got really bored and reviewed all their PRs at last.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
But yeah, some of the stats as we got 4,000 committers.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
If you sum all of the get hub stars over the matrix, the organization, it comes to over 50,000 and we're not double counting anybody there at all.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
And loads of clients. 40 is way more than that.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I should have reviewed this.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I tried to figure out.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
My preferred one is this one.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Like we have projects with over 30 different programming languages.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
We're getting almost kicked out, Matthew.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Okay, we've got two minutes. We're just going to talk.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Easy, easy.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
So yes, 30 programming languages from everywhere, all sorts, and that's really fun.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
So today's menu, lots of talks. We're not going to go through them because we have a QR code, plus you already know it's probably sitting here.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Or you're looking at it on the internet.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
We've got a URL that nobody will be able to see, but it's the same as the one on the platform there.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
And also follow along on, yeah, the schedules there, but follow along on matrix.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
There are going to be people out there in the void who we should connect with physically and create a proper hybrid room.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Welcome.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Woo.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Welcome. Hope you will have fun.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
And over to Florian.

08:21.000 --> 08:43.000
Thank you.
