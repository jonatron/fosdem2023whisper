Aurora and Michael presented two sister initiatives, the NGA Search and OpenWeb Search.U projects, aimed at transforming open search and discovery on the internet. NGA Search is a European project inviting entrepreneurs, tech experts, developers, and socially engaged people to submit projects that align with European values of openness, transparency, privacy, and trust. OpenWeb Search.U is a project funded by the EU that aims to develop an open European infrastructure for a web search. The project partners collaborate and build up a European open web index, which is publicly available, and researchers, innovators, and businesses can contribute either by developing their own business models or by involving in one of the three public calls.
