{"text": " So, hello. Welcome, everybody. I'm announced as Winfrey Tilanus, but I should also announce Emily Tromp. We did this project together, and unfortunately she couldn't make it today because of problems with public transportation. So, she's now at home watching this presentation and I hope I can make her proud. I'm Winfrey Tilanus. I'm just a privacy expert and usually making totally dull, bad design presentations. Emily is a designer, really working with design thinking and really likes to reframe things. And she's also the one who is responsible for this really great presentation. I'm totally happy with it. So, value-driven design. And this is about the case study. And it has been really successful, privately, by design project. But we did a lot wrong and we make a lot of failures. Fortunately, we learned from it and we went on. And so, this presentation will be the story about that one. But before I really dive deep into it, I want to ask you a question. When you think about privacy, which concept do you think is most related? Is it about the requirements the technicians have to have to build the system in a private way? Is it about the trust of the end-users? Or is it about agency, about their ability of end-users to make their own choices? So, what do you think? Let's make a little poll of it. I hope it works. This is the first time I use NextCloud for a poll. It goes to a domain totally owned by me, so you have to trust me. So you already answered the question. It's also an IPv6 that might be a problem. Are you connected to the dual stack? Yeah, let's... Wait. Yeah. So, we think it's about requirements. See one hand. We think it's about trust. Alright. A little bit more than half of it. We think it's about agency. Quite close to each other. But requirements are down the list, I believe. Alright. This is what I will be talking about. The design challenge, the thing we had to design. Then, three perspectives on privacy. The approach we did in the design project. And what we learned from it. So, the design challenge was promoting agency with an open-source ecosystem for e-hels. One button. There are some things that are really important here. First of all, it is... It had to be about a digital open-source exchange standard. The idea that was envisioned were all different kind of e-hels apps. All kind of health professionals. All working together in unpredictable ways and unpredictable combinations. And that had to cooperate. So we had to find a way to make a standard to have these them communicate. And all the other starting point of the project was user agency. The idea was when people have to control about their own path in the health care system or in the care system, then they make same choices. They choose what's good for them. And that makes the health care system better and better affordable. So agency was not only just because we like to be ourselves and to have the possibility to be ourselves. It was really at the heart of the project of the question. Another part of it is, I already told a bit, it's really about the ecosystem of care. I see these are the wrong way. Ecosystem of care applications and blending with health applications. So more informal care, more social work comparing with really hard medical care. And these have different security levels. And they need different levels of trust. And trusting your neighbor is something else than trusting your doctor. So we all had to design for this. Well, then we started and we discovered that there were three perspectives on privacy that were really causing havoc in the project. Confusion, misunderstandings, everything. So the three perspectives was really a theoretical perspective. I told I'm the privacy expert. We like to make dual presentations with lots of text. And I really like to think about what means privacy, how does it relate to agency. And I came up with talking with peers on a relational view on privacy. And that relational view is really focusing on the choices we make. I'm standing here in certain clothes, revealing certain things about myself, not revealing other things about myself. Those choices about how we feel create how I relate to you and how I appear to you. And also that creates a relation. And we all make these choices. Just look around and see how we are. There's no process. We do this all the time. And by these choices we create agency. By these choices we can determine who we are and who we are in certain contexts. So that's really the theoretical sort we had about it. And then we had the end user perspective. And we really went into neighborhood centers, talked with users, gave them an app, asked how do you experience this. And they were totally somewhere different. What's this? This is complicated. Don't know how to handle it. And I have to enter this data. Why? And where does it go? And I don't trust this thing. And then we were sitting at the table with developers from the companies making the ELs and the care apps. And they were asking, well, tell us what to do. What are the requirements? So they're all talking different languages. So we had to find a way to get on, to get this big misunderstanding solved and to get something that got everything together. And we had to test it with users. It might be a problem because we were creating an abstract exchange standard and not an app or something like that. So we had to bridge a gap. And we took a step back. We're thinking, what are the common values? What are they talking about? What are the things that they share and what they all want to have in the system? And that's where the trust and the agency came in. That's where, when we noticed that users really wanted to see experience that they could trust the system and experience that they could make changes. And the developers, well, they're not bad guys. They don't want to violate everybody's privacy. They're working in health apps. So they know that it's important. So when you talk with them about what's needed in such a ecosystem, they very well understand there's also trust in the agency. It's really important to give the choices and to make sure that you are trusted. So we translated these principles of these common values into design principles. Tell more about it later. And, of course, I was there also and I helped to treat them, give my own input to the design principles. So that's how we came to a set of design principles that were bridging this gap. And then we came to the next problem I already mentioned it, how to use a test. Yeah, how to use a test of standards, abstract thing that can have totally different faces and all different kind of apps. And, you know, when we literally went to neighborhoods and talked about trust and agency and everybody was, what are you talking about? So we came up with a privacy game. And it was a small game, small simulation. And we used that to envision abstract scenarios. And we made a scenario about you're in this situation and you want to share this with somebody with who you want to share with or you're in this situation, you're talking to this person, what do you share, don't you share? Then we changed in the twist of the game. Turned the page around and then there was a new part of it. For example, somebody else or some changing your information, what you maybe made want to share. And based on that, we got into discussion, talks with the users about how they made the choices and if we could validate the principles we formulated. So by playing this game, we made it, creating this game, we really made it possible to see visible what, what, how the abstract scenarios, abstract principles, design principles worked out. So what did we learn? What are the things we got out of this? First of all, trust is an iterative process. You don't, even when you go in at the doctor, it would be totally strange to have a shield at the door of the doctor. Please undress yourself in the waiting room. You know, you first want to make contact, want to see, well, is this a doctor I like to see? And then slowly you start to trust the doctor and then slowly you said, well, now it's appropriate to undress. And the same happens between a human and a machine or when you interact with an app. It's not just, well, there are many apps where you have to first page, you see, create an account and you have to tell everything about yourself. And you're looking at it, well, why should I trust this app with all this information? Maybe the app suite is show that it's useful and there's some nice interaction with you. So next thing is reciprocity of the information or what happens. I share, you share. It's not one way around. Everyone wants to know everything about you and doesn't give you anything back, doesn't show what it does with it. Maybe you say I want to donate information about myself because I can help somebody else, but it has to be made visible. It has to be too racing. So really, I share, you share. People are willing to trust if there's balance. And then the last one, and that one was really important for the designers, we tell them these principles, they must be backed with your technical solution. The first thing they said, well, identify in the system. Well, let's use the email address because it's easy and everybody has it and then you can use it everywhere. But then people lose control about where the data goes because somebody can link all the email addresses across all applications. So if you want to give people really agency, really the possibility to make choices on a technical level also, then you have to say to the developers, well, for each link between two apps, you use a unique identifier. And if you want to share a piece of information across several apps, you have to create a star and make a deliberate decision to share it and really back that up in your technical architecture. So we really could tell there are the developers, well, this is what you should do. And it was really nice because we had many meetings with the developers, different developers, they were really, wow, we don't understand this. And then we came with these principles. Oh, and then I said, oh, then can do this and this and then the old piece together for them. And then they really drafted in several days and first version of a standard. So these are the principles we found. Well, I have another poll, but let's do it manual. I have five minutes left in my talk and five minutes for questions and I want to lengthen this. I'm a bit wondering, curious, and let's just shout out, raise hands, whatever. What do you take away from this presentation? What did you learn? Because I told about what we learned, but I'm wondering what you did learn. The back and forth of information and how we should build trust. I immediately identify with that. When you get an app and you have to fill in everything at first before you know what it does or what it's going to do with it, then you're way more apprehensive to do that. I repeat it a bit because otherwise it's not on the video. So it's the interactive building of trust. I might be projecting here a little bit, but some of the struggles you mentioned remind me of when I worked in the aid sector, where many people would try to apply design principles like human-centered design to develop a solution for certain people. But it's very difficult to ignore these larger economic contexts. So when you talk about privacy and people not being engaged with it, maybe they aren't politically engaged with the topic, educating them and figuring out how to mediate that. It reminded me of working in the aid sector. You have experience in a similar sector and you went into really the commercial barriers of parties who didn't think this way, didn't want to implement it. It's interesting because we were with lots of commercial organizations around the table and they were willing to cooperate and they were willing to change something. They had some idealism there too, but it is a problem in the care sector because it is a huge economic sector with lots of money and lots of people who try to get a bit of the money. So I feel your problem. Any other takeaways? A quite abstract question. How did you came out with the user testing as a game? And was it actually a game or was it a game as you just mean as kind of the exchange information? It was not a game you can win, but it might be played a bit as a party game and might be nice. They have lots of games, card games from this. It was a paper game and we literally went to neighborhood centers and sat with people, visiting there around the table and play the game with them. And interviewed them afterwards about even before and after about how to even influence. I work as a UX researcher and sorry, I was just curious. I find it really interesting how open source projects make decisions about which methodology to use or which tool to use. So I was just curious how did you guys make the decision to use the game because it's a tool that I've never heard of before and I'm very open to learning. So the question is how did you make the choice for the game for testing? And well, we didn't make a choice. We tried lots of things and we had many sessions in neighborhood centers that were totally failed and then we had a feeling well we need a way to discuss more. And then we came up with the game and we noticed this works and now when we're looking back we can make a nice story about it. Linear from well we had the game and it worked but I left out about a dozen of failures there. I can give you more information about the game and it's yeah, I've bought a paper on it and the game available too. Thank you. I never considered including privacy into exactly what I'm thinking of process. My question would be, how do you include a GNPR inside the process because it's part of the privacy you get to have the perfection of this art because saying to the end users this is the low and this is how it can help you and protect you if you have room for the trust. So the question is how do you include the GNPR in font and design? And well, I love. I once been introduced at the conference as a person who laughs about the GNPR. The point is, when you work like this, well, let's move on. We are now here. When you work like this, you have a far better way of handling privacy of your users than the DDPR says. And for example, part of the pattern is that in the iterative pattern you only ask for information when needed. And then you make clear why you need it. But that is already awfully close to an official privacy question you may have to ask according to the DDPR. Maybe add a link to some additional information with all legal stuff in it. But they are already there. Then you have asked a meaningful consent question. And that's, but that's just logical to do it at when you're designing this way. So just design for privacy and then the DDPR should be included already. Yeah, good to know you're the dark side. Well, can you give a clear example of how you do reciprocity and information exchange? Yeah, for example, there are two levels because you can, between humans, you can deliberately support and we already also had some design patterns, but there were UI design patterns that couldn't, couldn't be forced on all apps. But you can really support two-way communication before telling somebody something. And you can really support, well, I asked you this, but I want to ask you this because when I know I can do this or this for you. And so you can support in your design of the chat, interaction, messages, patterns like that. And you can also do that in human-to-machine things. The app asking, well, I really like, if you like to, then we can arrange it if you come back that I remember what you did. But to do so, I need an account. Exactly. Exactly. And don't ask before it is already clear what you can give back for it. Start, for example, with anonymous accounts. And then people can see what the app is doing. And well, at a certain point, you can say, maybe it's interesting if I remember this. Shell, would you like to make an account? So don't ask the account. And then for the account, ask only what's needed for the account. Don't ask anything more. Yeah? One final question. We're just coming close to time. What kind of failures? One final question you said. We had, for example, try to make a really taxonomy and architecture that would support all fine-grained type of privacy patterns. And that became a huge picture with lots of doorings and lines and data model that was really exploding on all sides. And nobody understood it anymore. And it was bonkers to even think about implementing it. And spend some days on doing all the boxes. No, that's not the way to go. To give one example. So the answer was constant feedback and express the whys and not just the whys. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I think we're just over time now. So thank you so much for your time.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.200000000000001, "text": " So, hello. Welcome, everybody.
