The talk is about using SPDX to establish traceability for functional safety. The speaker discusses the importance of functional safety in ensuring that systems can handle and detect potential failures, and the need for robust systems and accurate documentation to achieve this. They propose using SPDX, a software bill of materials, to track and manage all the documents and artifacts related to functional safety. This would allow for better traceability, completeness, and consistency of safety information, and make assessments and updates more efficient and error-free. The speaker also mentions ongoing work to develop tools and pilot projects to support this idea.
