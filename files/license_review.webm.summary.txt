The speaker, Pam Chastak, talks about proposed changes to the license review process by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). The changes include evaluating the criteria for approving licenses, the process for considering licenses, the current categories for licenses, and the decertification of licenses. The speaker also discusses the need for machine-readable tags to provide more digestible information about licenses and plans to have three categories of licenses: rejected, approved, and preferred. The focus is on building community and ensuring licenses are adopted for the right reasons. The speaker encourages feedback on the proposed changes to be submitted on the OSI website.
