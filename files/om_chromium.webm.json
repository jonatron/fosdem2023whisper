{"text": " So we continue with our next talk, sorry for all the technical problems we have today. Our next talk is by Michael Dobrich about modern camera handling in Chromium. Thank you. So I'll talk a bit about camera handling in Chromium. I think Vim already teased some of the things at the end of his talk, so you'll notice similarities or reoccurring things that you already mentioned. But I'm going to dive deeper into how this actually works and the implementation, how we got to where we are now, and what's still missing. Okay, so let's start a short bit above me. I'm Michael Dobrich, and I work for Pengatronics. I'm an embedded developer, Linux embedded developer, mostly doing graphics kind of things. So what's right now in Chromium is basically video for Linux. Anyone who doesn't know what video for Linux is here in the room? A few people. Okay, just a few words. Video for Linux is the kernel API to talk to cameras, or other devices too, but interesting here is camera. It's relatively simple API, just watch the format and give me a frame. And if you look at the Chromium code, it's, I'd say, well, there's little development, but it's basically done. We'll get to that information a bit later, because that's why I'm mentioning it. I mean, the camera, the API is stable, it hasn't changed a lot, and the camera is working in the browser, so there's not much to do to change that. And then I started with a project where we wanted to do more with cameras on a Linux system. It was a more or less embedded device, and the first thing was we wanted to choose if an application can use a camera, and which camera it's supposed to use or allowed to use. And that's currently not possible, because Chromium directly talks with the kernel and just picks the camera, right? And then there were web pages that didn't have the API to, the new API to do screen sharing that didn't use that, so we wanted to basically pipe in the screen as a camera into this web page. That was mostly in the earlier days of the video conferencing kind of things, and more the commercial applications that had their products ready and done and didn't want to implement new kind of things. It's getting less, but it's still some of them are still out there. And then there were some cameras that only HG64, and that's not supported by, I don't think any browser on Linux actually can handle HG64, only cameras in the browser. And then I wanted to attach IP cameras. So I have the camera maybe back there in the room, and I want to use that for a camera in a video conference call, right? If you have a bigger room and you don't want to use a long USB cable, then that would be ideal, but I can't attach an IP camera to video for Linux, right? So that's what I was stating, but these are not exactly common use cases. I was looking for something I could argue, what can I do to bring this to Chromium mainline? So if I want to implement something there, I need something what's more, yeah, good, an excuse exactly to say this is useful for other people too. So I started looking, and the first thing that I came across then was because I was also looking at or had used the screen sharing part, which works with the portal kind of things and in containers, that was my first use case where I said, hey, these kind of people, and that's what Vim mentioned earlier as well, is we want to say who's allowed to use the camera, and that was one use case I had in mind to say, hey, we need a new high-level API, we need an API where we can say outside of the browser if the browser is allowed to use the camera. And then while I was already implementing these kind of things, actually the lip camera stuff came up. Vim also mentioned that in his talk that we have new ways to talk to cameras, and there was no back end in Chromium there, and so the idea was to promote and say, hey, let's use this shared high-level API for the browsers and just plug in the lip camera at the back end, which by the way is already implemented because, yeah, I'll get to that in a second. So we want to do the authorization kind of thing, and we want to do high-level API so we can put something else in behind. And the solution was already there. As soon as I really started looking, it was obvious because the XG desktop portal kind of thing, that's the portal stuff that Vim mentioned, it already had an API for camera. It was basically not used, I think. I didn't find any real-life implementations that used it in a common case, but it was already there. And so I said, okay, let's do that, and already was involved with pipe wire and used it for the screen sharing kind of thing, so nothing new to me. And I said, okay, let's implement that. And I started to implement. But before that, I want to say a bit about how it works. So the browser needs to talk to the portal and say, hey, I access camera, that's basically the API call to the portal and say, hey, I want to access the camera, am I allowed to do that? Okay, yeah, you're allowed to do that. Okay, great. Then, well, yeah, I need this pipe wire remote to basically get the connection to the pipe wire and say, okay, well, and then the portal says, okay, pipe wire connect, we want to talk to you. And what the portal is doing then is restricting access. So the browser won't have access to everything that's available on pipe wire, but actually only the cameras, because we only allowed access to the cameras. There is a lot more details there in the background, but for the Chromium side for the implementation, we don't need to care about that. So, and then the portal hands over the file descriptor to Chromium, and Chromium can talk to pipe wire directly and access camera. And then the Chromium starts sending messages basically to pipe wire and says, hey, we'll need the objects, and then the objects show up, and I need your properties for all the objects, and basically builds up a list of cameras. But it takes several round trips between Chromium and pipe wire to get to that list. That will be important again later as well, because we're talking multiple processes here, and so it can take a bit of time. And once we're there, the user selects the camera and says, okay, we want to start streaming, then we'll start streaming and pipe wire sends video frames over to Chromium. That's basically the easy part at the end, although there is some format handling there involved as well. So, okay, first try. I was a bit naive actually at that point. I started implementing this kind of thing that was basically two years ago, and I had more or less pull requests in Garrett with change set, I think, this change list, CL, whatever. And, well, I posted it, I had it ready for review, and there was not a lot of review going on. But I'm not going trying to blame anyone here, but as I said at the beginning, the camera stuff in Chromium was basically done. So, there weren't a lot of people working on that. Also, they knew maybe the Chromium camera API and video for Linux, but I had this new pipe wire portal debus code in there, and none of the developers were actually familiar with that kind of code. So, it was slow going, there was mostly some high level review for how the integration worked, and then there were some issues with, okay, this is not just Chromium, this is also Google Chrome, and that's a binary built, that's deployed on multiple platforms, so we cannot just link to the pipe wire, because it may not be there, so we need to load it dynamically. But WebRTC, and when I talk about WebRTC in this talk, I'm talking about the implementation used by the browsers, not specifically the specification kind of things. So, in WebRTC, the pipe wire is also loaded dynamically for the screen sharing. That should have been a red flag for me, but I didn't know this at the time. So, basically, WebRTC tried to load the pipe wire, I tried to load the pipe wire in Chromium, and that clashed. There were just architectural problems to do both at the same time. And that's when we're stuck a bit and thinking about how to work around that issue, and that the merge request basically could solve a bit. And then, someone came on the platform, Yang Rouli, for example, and he was actually someone who knew about the pipe wire stuff, about the portal stuff, and said, hey, well, we shouldn't do that in Chromium, we should do that in WebRTC. And I said, okay, great. I was actually sitting down with them and with Jan and Mark Volts in a video conference, and we talked a bit about the architecture side and said, okay, right, WebRTC is the right place because if I put it in WebRTC, WebRTC is also used by Firefox. So, Firefox can also use my implementation to do cameras. So, second try, do it in WebRTC. There is already a camera API that's used by Firefox, actually, and on Linux, it just implements Vigital Linux. So, the idea was I put a back end for pipe wire in WebRTC, and I put a back end for WebRTC in Chromium, basically just an interaction. Yeah, there was an API, but there were some issues. I mean, it was an API designed for APIs like Vigital Linux. And if you enumerate devices in Vigital Linux, you can do that, basically, instantaneously. Just open a few file descriptors, send a few Ioc codes, and you're done. So, there was a synchronous call to give me all the cameras. And, well, as I showed before, we need to talk to the portal. The portal may actually ask the user if the application is allowed to access the camera. And then we need to iterate over the devices found or the cameras found in pipe wires. That's not something we can do in a synchronous function call in a browser. So, I needed a new asynchronous API to do actually this enumeration. And then, for the API, it was also, here's the static function. Give it a string, it's an argument to select the camera, and open this camera for me. Same issue here. I need, or similar issue related. I have this open connection to pipe wire that I need to keep open to access the camera. Otherwise, we would need to talk to the portal again, which doesn't make sense. So, basically, we need some state from the carried over from the enumeration of the cameras to actually accessing the cameras. Wasn't there either? So, needed a new API. And on the other end of the API, the frames that came out of the stack were already converted to I420, some pixel format. And this included a copy. Basically, WebRTC took the raw frame from the camera, converted or copied it to the new format, and then handed it to the browser. But Gromium basically assumed that the camera would give it the raw frame from the camera, converted in itself, or copied it. So, if I would use that API, I would basically have two copies. Wanted to write that, so I need a new API to access the raw frame from the browser. So, suddenly, my single merge request to just add the camera support to Gromium grew a bit, so it was a little bit more than that. So, right. And at the end of the day, I wanted to do this without causing any regressions, right? So, the first step is we add a feature flag actually in Gromium. So, if you want to use that, once it's merged, it will be disabled by default at first. So, if you want to try it, you need to enable this feature flag and that's, we want to use pipe wire for cameras. Okay, if we put that, then we go to the web RTC and ask the web RTC, hey, there is a software switch basically and I built what's used by the implementation in Gromium and says, okay, we want to use pipe wire. So, that's why we're going here. There's also a video for Linux implementation. That's not used by Gromium because Gromium has its own VGF Linux implementation. So, this way, if we say pipe wire is not enabled, this is actually implemented for Firefox because we may want to disable the pipe wire stuff in the web RTC from the Firefox side of things if it's disabled there and then just go this route to the VGF Linux implementation in web RTC, but that's not used in Gromium. So, we say, okay, pipe wire is enabled, so we go here. That portal is the portal actually available. So, we have a build from Gromium and at some point enable it maybe always, but still the Linux system underneath may not have a portal implementation running. So, if that fails, we need to go back, okay, VGF Linux is disabled and then we fall back to the VGF Linux implementation in Gromium, but if it works, then we ask the user that maybe cached or is often cached. So, you won't see that more than once typically, but if the user says yes, Gromium is allowed to use the camera, then we actually get access to the camera and here is where the pipe wire stuff actually starts. So, you need to set the switch and then hopefully have a working portal set up and then you can use the camera this way. Okay, where are we? I mean, part of this talk is to say, to raise a bit of awareness, maybe someone who can review more things or maybe add later stuff later on. So, let's talk about what's there. First commit was split out generic portal pipe wire code that was code used in the screen sharing for the portal that could also be used for camera sharing with the portal. So, we put that in a place where it can be shared. Then the next part was the raw frame. I mentioned that earlier. We don't want to do the double copy. That was basically adding a bit of new API and then merged, I think, just two days ago is the actual pipe wire portal capture support within WebRTC. That was merged just a few days ago. So, great. So, the WebRTC is mostly done. I'm not sure what Firefox will do. Basically, it's ready for Firefox people to implement things in Firefox. I don't know if someone was working on it. If not, maybe someone here is interested in that so they can do that part. There's basically just a small merge request left because all this camera kind of things in WebRTC is not actually built right now if we're building WebRTC for Chromium. So, we need just to do an infrastructure a bit, build these files as well. That's all the WebRTC is aligned. Then we come to Chromium. In Chromium, there are two commits pending. None of them have been merged yet. The first is basically, well, there is this Linux camera backend right now in Chromium, which is with your full Linux backend. So, basically, rename it from Linux to with your full Linux, place a switch in front of it. That's where this feature flag comes in. We'll say, okay, can we do portal or not? So, we make space to put a separate backend there next to it. The second commit is the actual implementation. Once that's merged, then we actually have the full support. Hopefully, that happens in the next few. Well, weeks is probably a bit optimistic, but months. Okay. What's next? So, for me, I'll probably won't work on these kind of things in the near future because this was done for a customer project and it's taken a long time and they are getting, well, they've been good support about this. So, it's really, there was no complaining, but I do need to get on with other kind of things. I haven't done this full time, right? This was always, I do a bit, then wait for review, then get some review. So, these kind of things, but I need to get this finished up. So, but there are a lot more features to come. There is some new exigitester portal device API was mentioned on one of my merge requests that there's some API stuff coming that's still not merged. There's a request, but once that's in, the idea would be to support that to access cameras. And then there are some more features that Chromium supports for cameras like rotation that are not yet supported by the new backend. I'm not sure if the whole stack below that already supports all of it. I'm pretty sure that pipe wire does. I'm not quite certain, but I think so. There is API in WebRTC for rotation. So, just, I think it mostly needs to be hooked up. So, we can rotate the camera image 90s, 180 or 270 degrees. And then there are also features basically if you know with your Philinux, they have the controls to do panning, tilting, zooming, focus handling, whatever. And kind of a few of those things are integrated in Chromium as basically image properties, I think. And they are hooked up in the Vigifilinux back end, but I don't think there is an API in pipe wire to access that. I'm not quite sure. So, maybe we need to add it to the whole stack. So, there's some work to be done there as well. But my hope is that at some point that gets added and then we can really switch the pipe wire camera on as default in Chromium because I don't think it will be accepted as a default unless we have a more or less basic feature parity there. So, still work to be done. So, hopefully, maybe someone got interested and will help out there. Okay. A few thanks, Wolfvision. That's my customer who sponsored this work, so I'll put them here there. Jan Grulich and Mark Foltz, they actually got the review started because once they got involved and noticed my patches, they found people that actually could press the necessary buttons on the review and say, okay, this is accepted. And they did a lot of review there. Talked to me about the architecture, so they helped me get on with it. And Ilya, I don't know, and Alex Cooper, they did a lot of review as well. And Kieran Bingham, he's doing a lot of lip camera work. Mentioned my work actually last year on ELCE. But he's done a lot of testing because he is trying out his lip camera stuff in combination with my Chromium patches, so a lot of testing and review there as well. And probably a few more reviewers that I missed just went over the list. People that said something on the request and went to the longest dose that seemed to be had the most comments here. Okay. I'm almost done, so I'll come to your question in a second. So, yeah, like everybody we're hiring all of our companies need good people. Okay. So, thanks and questions. So, I'll start with you. Yeah, just a comment that Kieran is going to give a talk on lip camera in one hour in the salon room. Yeah. Okay. Kieran is giving a talk about lip camera in which that embedded an automotive room. So, maybe I'll be there. Exactly. So, any other questions? Okay. Here. There is a comment discussion for all the bits. How do we need to keep an eye on other questions? If there is a page for all the bits. I don't have any webpages, anything for that. But if you basically subscribe to the last one, that's the one where it gets interesting, right? Okay. Any other questions? Okay.
