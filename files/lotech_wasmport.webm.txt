[00:00.000 --> 00:08.480]  Okay, let's go, it's me again.
[00:08.480 --> 00:15.400]  Somebody just throws some, I don't know, vegetables at me if the ten minutes are over.
[00:15.400 --> 00:21.080]  If you came for a WebAssembly here, I have to disappoint you, so we'll have to wait another
[00:21.080 --> 00:24.280]  one or two talks when we will talk about that.
[00:24.280 --> 00:30.240]  I re-purposed the slot here to talk a little bit about something equally cool, wonderful,
[00:30.240 --> 00:33.800]  spiffy with a rocket engine for liberal office templates.
[00:33.800 --> 00:42.960]  Well, small disappointment, it's about Walmux, but I think it's, I'm kind of serious there,
[00:42.960 --> 00:51.080]  that perhaps the name, we could think about a different one.
[00:51.080 --> 00:56.200]  So quick intro, what is that if you haven't heard about it?
[00:56.200 --> 01:05.720]  It's a Java extension to liberal office and it's there for template and forms management
[01:05.720 --> 01:08.440]  and also like extending mail merge.
[01:08.440 --> 01:16.080]  So those are two views on it, the left one is the sidebar extension, you see three sidebar
[01:16.080 --> 01:18.000]  panels been added there.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.960]  This is just a selection of sample templates there.
[01:22.960 --> 01:31.760]  And the right side is the kind of constructed, generated document out of that thing.
[01:31.760 --> 01:42.520]  So and all of that has been developed by the city of Munich starting around 2005-2006-ish
[01:42.520 --> 01:49.760]  under the Linux project umbrella, why, because they wanted to migrate to open office, they
[01:49.760 --> 01:54.800]  wanted some template management and there was nothing that was powerful enough.
[01:54.800 --> 02:00.520]  So they did what you do when it's not there and you do open-sourced stuff, you started
[02:00.520 --> 02:05.080]  doing something yourself and then open-sourced it.
[02:05.080 --> 02:11.600]  So that's what Munich did and there was some, well it was in production I think since 2008
[02:11.600 --> 02:18.440]  and there was some major upgrade to liberal office from open office which had some, we
[02:18.440 --> 02:26.520]  had to change some UNO stuff there and another major rework migrating from Java swing dialogues
[02:26.520 --> 02:33.040]  and UI to native liberal office UI and mostly sidebar which really nicely integrates as
[02:33.040 --> 02:35.640]  you've seen before.
[02:35.640 --> 02:47.440]  And this year or end of last year, since the Linux project is kind of sunsetting the extension
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.120]  itself which is extremely powerful, lovely, great, also cool for QA because it triggers
[02:53.120 --> 03:02.520]  really literally every little corner of the writer UNO API there, moving house to CDF.
[03:02.520 --> 03:10.720]  And what is it in the first place, it's predominantly for let's say very complex document generation
[03:10.720 --> 03:17.720]  workflows that you will find in larger companies, perhaps also in law firms or something but
[03:17.720 --> 03:21.280]  predominantly in the public sector.
[03:21.280 --> 03:28.960]  The idea behind there is kind of assemble your letter on the fly and employ the dry
[03:28.960 --> 03:35.520]  principle and only ever have one stylistic element or part of the template defined once
[03:35.520 --> 03:42.560]  and then you kind of include that like PHP or other template programming languages so
[03:42.560 --> 03:49.160]  you kind of piece that together, there's also like loops and control flow statements that
[03:49.160 --> 03:53.880]  you can use to kind of very dynamically generate forms.
[03:53.880 --> 03:59.680]  There's a forms generator so you can kind of have some user guidance like where to fill
[03:59.680 --> 04:05.840]  in what and pre-fill things and also dynamically kind of say oh when this is on then do that
[04:05.840 --> 04:08.960]  or not to do that or disable here.
[04:08.960 --> 04:15.000]  As I said, mail merge stuff and yeah this text programming and quotes content based
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.120]  directors doing something very dynamic.
[04:18.120 --> 04:27.320]  Okay so that thing is now has moved to CDF end of last year and we have been quite busy
[04:27.320 --> 04:33.560]  first of all like doing the move and also like doing some adaptations and adjustments
[04:33.560 --> 04:41.120]  and getting a kind of fit for let's say an international open source project like LibreOffice.
[04:41.120 --> 04:49.080]  What happened, Git repose moved to under the LibreOffice project on GitHub which was an
[04:49.080 --> 04:55.560]  easy like click so the old URL still work, you got a redirect that's pretty nice feature
[04:55.560 --> 05:00.800]  on GitHub so everybody can still, who had this clone can still work with it but the
[05:00.800 --> 05:03.080]  official location is now there.
[05:03.080 --> 05:11.800]  We added some translation workflow stuff, we made the Java like everything that it was
[05:11.800 --> 05:17.760]  a user visible string and the Java sources is now in PO files.
[05:17.760 --> 05:22.240]  We put this on TDS web late so the UI can be translated.
[05:22.240 --> 05:28.920]  We moved the documentation from a mark down Git based workflow into Media Wiki which is
[05:28.920 --> 05:36.360]  also much nicer than to translate for the community, for this mark down stuff, essentially
[05:36.360 --> 05:44.200]  needed some kind of developer setup to do that and Media Wiki has really nice, excellent
[05:44.200 --> 05:47.160]  translation support meanwhile.
[05:47.160 --> 05:52.360]  Fixed a number of bugs, made sure that it actually works not just with all the LibreOffice
[05:52.360 --> 05:56.080]  versions but with the most recent ones.
[05:56.080 --> 06:01.880]  We did some build fixes on the, there was some bits of the internal build system kind
[06:01.880 --> 06:07.720]  of leaking through that still so we made it actually build out of the box so you clone
[06:07.720 --> 06:12.400]  that, you build that with Maven and it actually works.
[06:12.400 --> 06:19.800]  Some tweaks with namespaces so we can then upload artifacts to the LibreOffice Maven repository
[06:19.800 --> 06:27.320]  and it doesn't have the old names anymore that were sometimes internal to City of Munich.
[06:27.320 --> 06:33.760]  We set up Jenkins drops so we can actually not only run tests on pull requests, we can
[06:33.760 --> 06:43.040]  also run releases there on the CI and tons of smaller things like started to do comment
[06:43.040 --> 06:50.040]  translation in the code, renamed variable names, got the build houses and other auxiliary
[06:50.040 --> 06:53.280]  documentation translated to English.
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.760]  It's not done, in particular the code stuff, that's not done.
[06:58.760 --> 07:04.560]  Part of that was already English but that's quite a bit left.
[07:04.560 --> 07:10.200]  Which gets us to next steps and the possible future.
[07:10.200 --> 07:19.880]  So handbook is not fully line of super clean, the original handbook was German so we translated
[07:19.880 --> 07:24.880]  it to English and then we wanted to reuse the old German translation because why do
[07:24.880 --> 07:30.040]  that work again and with the Bickey markup so that's kind of busy work there and we're
[07:30.040 --> 07:33.960]  kind of still mostly, we're still busy with that.
[07:33.960 --> 07:44.360]  I guess help appreciate it but no, okay so we get it done in the very near future.
[07:44.360 --> 07:53.600]  Some renaming for the Java packages, that kind of blocks each other with possibly renaming
[07:53.600 --> 07:59.040]  the project, we don't want to rename it twice, have some new landing page done, some more
[07:59.040 --> 08:05.760]  bug fixing, there's still some side bar, not so nice things and some thing that was one
[08:05.760 --> 08:11.800]  crash somewhere and then we want to reasonably soonish have some release there so that people
[08:11.800 --> 08:12.880]  actually can use that.
[08:12.880 --> 08:20.160]  If anybody's interested, we can have some snapshots possibly published, then again it
[08:20.160 --> 08:24.760]  should be relatively easy to build and if it's not, let's fix it.
[08:24.760 --> 08:31.480]  So actually maybe not publishing snapshots far and wide is a feature, not a bug, so we
[08:31.480 --> 08:36.440]  can fix the build system, yeah renaming.
[08:36.440 --> 08:44.120]  So we kind of brainstormed a little bit in the background, those are three suggestions
[08:44.120 --> 08:52.320]  that we will probably mull over and think about, so this LibreOffice template tool or
[08:52.320 --> 08:56.760]  template engine is probably what it actually is.
[08:56.760 --> 09:02.400]  So people would understand what it does when they see that somewhere.
[09:02.400 --> 09:08.640]  This forms and templates is a bit more ambitious because it does much more than just templates,
[09:08.640 --> 09:11.920]  but hey, naming is hard.
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.840]  So yeah and if you're curious come and help, so there's some easy hack there for comment
[09:16.840 --> 09:21.240]  translation, that's the easiest thing to get your feet wet.
[09:21.240 --> 09:28.120]  There are certainly more like UI and document translation, that would be great and of course
[09:28.120 --> 09:31.560]  if you have cool feature ideas, go get it implemented.
[09:31.560 --> 09:37.120]  So there's one thing, there's an old branch about QR code support, so you can kind of
[09:37.120 --> 09:43.400]  generate QR code and insert it like in this process of programmed software controlled
[09:43.400 --> 09:49.600]  template generation, that would be nice to get in or other things that people want in
[09:49.600 --> 09:53.000]  templates these days, and that's it, thanks so much.
