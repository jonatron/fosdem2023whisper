The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about an open source application called TopNG, which is a real-time network and traffic monitoring application designed for network monitoring and cybersecurity. TopNG uses a C++ engine for packet processing and an open source library called NDPI for packet inspection. It also allows for the creation of behavioral checks using Lua scripting. The talk discussed the challenges of extending the behavioral checks and using TopNG as a data lake for other programming languages such as Python. The talk also demonstrated how to use the Python library to access traffic information in TopNG and trigger custom actions based on alerts. The talk concluded by highlighting the efficiency and customization options of TopNG and inviting contributions to the project on GitHub.
