The talk presented Inspector Gadget, a tool based on eBPF to observe containers in free and open source software development. The speaker explained that containers isolate applications running on the same host operating system and discussed the use of namespaces and cgroups for security and resource isolation. They then introduced Inspector Gadget, which includes tracer, profile, snapshot, and top gadgets to monitor different aspects of container behavior. The speaker demonstrated the use of local gadgets to trace system calls and verify container capabilities. They also mentioned the future plans for Inspector Gadget, including improving scalability and adding new gadgets. In the Q&A, the speaker addressed questions about deploying on specific nodes, exporting metrics to Prometheus, and the performance impact of using Inspector Gadget.
