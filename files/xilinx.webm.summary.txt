The talk introduces an open source co-simulation solution using AMD's Syslink QMU and System C Development. Co-simulation mixes virtual platforms and simulation of RTL for faster simulation speed while keeping visibility to the RTL. A co-sim solution using Syslink QMU and System C involves creating machines through a hardware DTB, remote port protocol implementation in System C analyzing DDIs, bridges, and protocol checkers. AMD's Syslink QMU fork uses mainline QMU version 7.1.0 and has extra functionalities. The Silen System C wrapper standardizes System C interfaces used in interacting with Syslink QMU, bridges or drivers, and FPGA prototypes. There is a test suite and documentation for all the components of the co-simulation solution.
