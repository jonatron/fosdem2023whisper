In this talk, Peter Lowe showcases various weird and unusual things people have done with DNS, ranging from tracing routes to tunneling, blogging, and even full file extraction over DNS. He provides examples of libraries like Iodine for IP over DNS and DNS Cat 2 for client-server communication over DNS packets. He also mentions various tools like Slow DNS, a VPN over DNS, and HTTP over DNS for restricted networks, along with config management systems, BIMI brand indicators, contact databases, key-value stores, and even a file system over DNS. Links to all the examples and resources are provided at the end.
