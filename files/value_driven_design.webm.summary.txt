The talk was about a case study of a successful privacy project called "Value-Driven Design" which aimed to promote agency with an open-source ecosystem for e-health. The project encountered confusion and misunderstandings due to three perspectives on privacy: a theoretical perspective, an end-user perspective, and a developer perspective. The team bridged the gap by identifying the common values of trust and agency and translating them into design principles. To test these principles, they created a privacy game which helped them validate the principles and make the abstract scenarios more visible. The talk emphasized the importance of iterative trust-building and reciprocity in information exchange, and the need for design principles to be backed by technical solutions.
