The talk discusses stateless decoder virtualization using Verdeo Video and Rust. It explains the importance of video data and introduces Chromebooks as a new use case for exposing hardware acceleration capabilities to Android apps. The talk delves into the architecture of Verdeo Video and its implementation as a Viferal 2 stateful device. It also discusses CrossVM, a virtual machine manager used by Chromebooks, and various backends, including CrossCodeX, a Rust library for video decoding, and VA API backend. Future plans for upstreaming the radio video protocol, adding more codec support, and encoder support for CrossCodeX are also discussed.
