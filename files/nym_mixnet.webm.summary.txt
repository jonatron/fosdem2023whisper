Yoon Hockblatt gave a presentation about the NIM mixed net, a decentralized, incentivized anonymous network layer. It is powered by the Loupix design and uses Sphinx packets to obfuscate data by wrapping it in identically looking packages. It employs SERBs, single-use reply blocks, and supports private credentials to further protect user identities. It is currently funded by a EU project and a Swiss-based startup, but has ambitions of becoming a self-running, community-owned network. It can also be integrated into other cryptography-based services as a means of protecting meta-data in transactions.
