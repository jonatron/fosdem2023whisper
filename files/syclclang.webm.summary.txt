This talk explored compiler intrinsics and how they are used in Intel's open source Sickle implementation (DPC++). The speaker discussed the current process of redirecting Sickle code to SPIR-V openCL code and then linking it with a vendor-provided Bitcode library. He proposed introducing a new transformation which involves calling an LLVM compiler intrinsic and providing generic behavior of these intrinsics for offload targets. The proposal will improve the development and sharing of infrastructure and keep the open source programs up to date with the latest trends.
