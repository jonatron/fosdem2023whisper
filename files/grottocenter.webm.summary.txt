The speaker, Christopher Peters, presents Grotto Center, a wiki-style database for cavers to share information on caves and cast phenomena. The database is supported by the European Caving Federation and the International Caving Federation and uses CastLink, a standard for linking different documents to caves. The database uses AWS and Microsoft Azure and is built with JavaScript, NodeJS, and Docker. Users can add information themselves and browse scientific documents linked to specific caves. The project relies on interns from different schools and is sponsored by caving clubs and associations.
