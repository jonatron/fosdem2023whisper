Tableau Noir is an online blackboard designed for teachers and students to interact in a simplified way during a time of lockdown. The board is collaborative and uses a circular menu, reminiscent of video games, to make it easier to interact with. It also allows for animations, dynamic eraser size, text, and formulas. It is designed to be simple and to follow the "KISS" philosophy, meaning "keep it simple, stupid". It is also secure, does not require an account, and data is only stored when you click the share button. There is no zoom feature due to the fact that it will create issues when people have different zoom levels. Finally, the presentation mode of the tool can be used like a physical blackboard with animations and manettes.
