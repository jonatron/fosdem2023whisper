{"text": " All right, thanks for having me, folks. So let's have a quick chat about Surikara, open source, ideas, network security monitoring and all those sorts of things. And what it used to look like before and what it looks like now, at least from our perspective and all the things that we need to take care of and the things that we have still challenges with. So a quick overview of the agenda. We're going to talk about what is Surikara, how it started, how it evolved, challenges when we're monitoring the traffic and how to get involved basically and help out. First of all, I'll introduce Eric, he's my colleague, he was supposed to be here today, he fled, got cancelled and he couldn't make it, but we did the presentation together. So apologies, he actually just touched down at the Brussels airport. So Eric is the city of Stamels Network, he's part of the OSF team, that's where I met him during the Surikara, developing Q&A during the Surikara project. He's also a member of the board of directors, a Linux kernel, let's go developer, he maintains also Sirius and Selk's and that's the Twitter handle in there. So apologies, Eric could not make it and that's why I'm making the introduction with him, he's a great open source colleague and a friend. My name is Peter Manev, I am 13, almost 14 years with Surikara, I'm part of the OSF exec team and where I usually do a lot of things around Surikara Q&A and trainings. I'm also a chief strategy officer of Stamels Networks, I'm one of the maintainers for the open source distribution, Selk's, I really like thread hunting and lots of open source around it, I'm guessing lots of people here in the conference too. So what is actually Surikara? So basically a high performance network security monitoring engine that can do active or passive monitoring and also produces a lot of application and protocol metadata. Open source, GPL2, code is available on GitHub of course and basically produces when you plug Surikara in the network, it just gives you this high level situational awareness of what's happening on the network, what's going on, something you should be aware of or something you didn't know or to confirm things, for example, you know we have these a lot of angles like trust but verify to use the famous quote, you know we have zero trust architectures, you want to confirm that they're actually implemented. It's one thing to implement, it's another thing to confirm that it's there. And actually Surikara is used by a lot of organizations, a lot of people, it's awesome to see it and really, really thankful for that and all the feedback and sometimes organizations before use it even without knowing because it's embedded in a lot of vendor appliances and similar. So what can Surikara do? Basically it's a few options there. It's an idea system, so intrusion detection system, it could be in passive mode, right? So it could be in line, intrusion prevention system where it actually actively stops or enables a connection to pass through or not. It can also be just purely network security monitoring perspective, you know it works without rules, it can just generate all sorts of protocol, flow data, file extraction and similar. It can also store everything it sees on disk, so it can also do full packet capture. And very often you see users of Surikara in combinations like this, so for example IDS plus NSM mode with all the network protocol data and full packet capture and similar. There is also something new coming up in Surikara 7, Surikara 7 RC was just released this week. And it's called conditional pick up capture which is actually code introduced and developed and donated by Eric. What it allows you to do is, so for example if you have an alert it will save that whole session, so not just the packet but the full session. So in that way you actually have the full sessions for all alerts stored in pick up as opposed to having to do full packet capture which in a lot of cases might be prohibitive. So basically use the network to defend ourselves, observe, protect, adapt, that's what we do, that's what we try to excel at every day. And this is a quick snapshot from actually our website. So some major features. To name a few, yeah more from configuration, JSON for output, multi-threaded, there's hardware acceleration and that becomes more and more relevant these days because the speeds are going up and up all the time. Network metadata logging by a lot of protocols, we are going to name all of them here, some of the main ones are here, more advanced parsing and automatic detection of HTTP DNS, SMB, SMTP TLS, all those guys and more. One thing that Surigata does very well is file extraction, SMB, FTP, HTTP, FTP2, SMTP, all that and the cool feature about that is actually it automatically de-duplicates when it's extracted. So if the same file is seen 10 times it will only be saved or extracted once to disk. So in other words saving a lot of space, really a lot. And of course support for SCADA, that's upcoming and we need more and more of that but it's also very relevant these days. So why the network? Well, because everything happens from the network. Everything from social media to finance to to name it, everything is on the network. So the good people are there, the bad people are there. So even if you have malicious actors getting in, even to get in is actually 99% of the cases it's over the network. And once they get in they need to either exfiltrate or move laterally or do some other part, that's still happening on the network. So you have to double to observe that. It's not the only place where you need to observe from security perspective, there's others of course but the network is one of the major ones. And while you're doing all that, while you're confirming if things are configured as expected or not or if all the connections are correct or there's no some anomaly and all things like that, you have to be able to identify and stop this activity. Granted there are differences, right? So a university network is totally different from a bank corporate network, there's totally different things, believe me. So network metadata logging, so we actually provide a lot of metadata around any alert event or metadata just on its own, you don't need to have an alert. So default output format is JSON, right, JavaScript object notation. And on the right hand side here you can see actually a picture, a small snippet actually of an event type, HTTP or an HTTP protocol. So all the different protocols have their own event type and they're logged in like that and then next to that you also have alerts. So file identification and extraction. One thing to mention is that file identification is done on the fly and it's automatic regardless of extensions and similar things like that, it's just using lib magic and those tools to be able to identify a file. So if it's like an executable, it's a PDF or if it's a PDF but with an extension TXT we'll still be able to match an extract if you want to that file. You can also match on SHA sums and other attributes of the file info events. So as I mentioned extract is sort of system deduplicated that really saves a lot of conversations with finance about sizing. So we have some pick up capabilities. Now what I mean by that, besides the fact that Suricada can actually store everything on disk and do full packet captures, Suricada can also read pickups. It's actually that part is also used a lot in a lot of sandboxes including, so for example, there is a few out there if you Google sandbox for example, there is a few that even offer free public services but to name one any run is like that actually automatically when a sample is detonated they also save the network traffic and that's also run by Suricada just to see what network protocol data and alerts are in there. So Suricada can read a single pick up, you can actually spin up a unique socket let's say and just feed pickups to it and every now and then you can point it to a folder and it will keep reading from that folder until it reads all the pickups or if there is nothing there it will pause and it will stop and when you throw a pick up in the folder it will continue really automatically, it's really automated in that part and of course you need to have multiple instances just to be on the safe side with that new chain that you did in QA you want to move it into Prod. So passive monitoring, how does it actually work? Here's an example basically we hooked up to a tap or a mirror port on switch and we just nipped the traffic. When you place that you're going to need probably multiple sensors in different scenarios you know it depends where you have on-prem cloud, virtual infrastructure and all that so you have to probably have multiple things but in general this is basically where it sits in passive mode so it logs all the alerts, the protocol metadata, any file, instruction events, pickups and all those things based on the monitoring that it does for that network. Now active monitoring, this is a little bit different, we stay in line so we allow or not traffic to pass. This is a bit more business critical, well not a bit more, it's much more business critical because you know it's actually able to stop effectively traffic so a lot more testing and due diligence in QA is needed there but basically how does it work? So basically you have this setup here, you have a user employee that receives a malicious document usually in a lot of cases it all starts with some sort of link or attachment that is being without intention opened by user or clicked by user so you have a network request and usually there is some sort of a signature or a rule that vets the traffic or inspects the traffic and says yes you can pass, no you cannot pass and this is a very basic example here for example a PowerShell script and then based on that there is a verdict, yes you can go or no you cannot go, either way and that's the inline mode right so there you actually actively making decisions of what can and cannot pass and similar. So one is much more acute, the other one is much easier because in the passive mode you are just monitoring traffic. So a little bit about our history and how we get there, how did we get here. So first lines of code 2007 by Victor Julien, he is the lead developer of Suricada, first release was in 2009, I joined the project 2010 April May somewhere around there so we are open source GPL and we actually have actively contributors and people contributing code, test donations from 23 different countries at the moment, well at least that was the last statistics but basically all continents and Suricada is owned by a non-profit foundation, the Suricada code it's open source and it's on GitHub but it's owned by a non-profit foundation on purpose and the purpose is actually so that it could never be sold, that's it. And this is basically how we started, OASFnet you'll find a little bit more info. So as I mentioned a little bit of a visual representation in there, so our first Suricada training believe it was in 2013 and our first Suricada was in 2015 and those were a lot of fun events and we learned a lot just by talking and interacting with the community. So big help there from the community and how did it used to work and look back in the day. So I had to generate that, this is basically an alert that what it looked like 14 years ago, what it looked like 20 years ago as well. So I had to generate that manually to look at what it produces but so basically that's an alert from 14, 15, 20 years ago, things like that. Not much to see there, not much to say there, right? So you have an IP and a port and a message, what are you going to do with it? Now you need to go find other tools, other protocol logs, you need to go to different machines to figure out what this IP is, what's that for, what's happened before, what happened after, is it a server, is it a laptop, is it guess whatever it is. So you needed to do a lot of work, this was just like a message. But back then it was one of the few things that were there, right? So there was nothing more than that. So fast forward to today. So this is an example for an alert but in a graphical interface anyway. So you have the alert, you have the signature metadata, you have in this case is HCP protocol and a lot of things do happen over clear text by the way because it's not vetted that much, especially in some environments and you also have the flow record, you know, packets, bytes to clients to server, similar things, durations and all those things. So you have a much better understanding when you look at an alert now, okay, so this is the status code, this is the request, this is the file and all those things, so you can actually judge much more. And one thing that actually came with time in Suricata is something called FlowID. What FlowID allows you, this was natively introduced in Suricata in 2014, what FlowID allows you to achieve is basically to correlate the specific alert to any and other protocol data from the same flow and session. So if you have an alert over SMB or something like that, you have all the SMB protocol records, the extracted files, you know, pick up, save, if you need to pick up, you have all that in the package. So much bigger evolution than what you saw in the previous screenshot. So how it works, this is a screenshot for example from e-box, it's a tool developed by Jason Nish, he's our colleague from the Suricata team and here's a quick example. Yeah, every session has a FlowID, right? So here is an alert with a FlowID and that translates to, in this case, that FlowID correlates the alerts to the Flow record, to the HTTP record, to the file info, which is actually the file metadata for that file transaction. So much bigger, much better visibility and you can actually make a decision much faster than needing to go look in other tools. This is actually a showcase of FlowID by Sirius, which is an open source web interface as part of CELX that they help maintain. But in any way, here is the file info on the bottom that is highlighted. You have the SHA, the file magic and everything is correlated between alerts, file info, Flow, logs by the help of that FlowID, which helps glue everything together. So really, really powerful. If I need, often enough I need to explain Suricata in one slide today. This is what Suricata does today. One IDS plus an assembly. So you have the alerts, you have the protocol data, you have the network flows, the file transactions, you do any file transactions and the pickup recordings, right? So you have everything in a package. It's much different when I started at least. So we have evolved and here is another run that is possible. So you could actually, it's a little known fact that Suricata alerts are only about 5-10% of all the data that it produces. The rest of the data is all protocols, data, metadata and things like that. The alerts are very, very small part and alerts, now at least I look at them as just context. It gives me something. It gives me an idea of what's happening. That's it. And that's all. I don't necessarily look at it as true or false positives. It's just like, okay, so that's what happened and I need the context around it. So we got a canned function without signature rules too, although it's not recommended because they help highlight certain events. So what challenges do we have? Well, all those years we need to keep the pace, right? We need to adapt. We need to adapt. We need to move forward. Signatures have evolved at least in Suricata, but back in the day it used to be a pattern match, a buffer overflow, some content triggering in the payload and it was very bounded with the IPS mindset. So you have to stop it. You have to look for something specific and it's expensive. It's CPU intensive actually to look on the fly at the 100 gigabit a second, for example, or pattern. You need to, for example, in IPS, you need to block, stop, protect the asset and similar. So we need to evolve from that to actually a bit more behavior analytics and including from the perspective of infrastructure, right? So you can say, hey, how many proxies they have on the network, right? That's interesting. Do you have proxies somewhere that NGINX, for example, proxies that somewhere in the network that they don't expect them to be? That sort of visibility, you know, that kind of difference. So TLS, okay, TLS is encrypted, sure, but the handshake is in clear text and during the handshake you can see a lot of things, including ciphers and things like that. What do you care about the cipher? Of course you do. Is it secure? Is it degraded? Is it recommended? You know, do you have applications that are using degraded ciphers? How do you know? Network security monitoring. That's the easiest way to do it, actually, or one, much easier than the other way. Put it that way. So you have system updates, you know, who's updating Debian, who's updating Ubuntu, things like that. They're very visible on the network, you know, and it's not about the actual system update, it's about actually do you expect it to happen, where it happens, and where it happens. So yeah, we have to evolve towards that direction and we have managed actually to do a huge leap there. More protocol implementation, right, so we need more and more protocols. Of course we do, but, you know, as it says here, it's no longer a network grip, so you have different protocols. You need application layer identification regardless of the port, you know, so it has to be automated. You need parsing, you need logging, you need to parse the protocol, you need to log it correctly, all those things require time and effort, you need specific keywords so you can hook up detection to for different parts of the protocol. And we need, like, secure protocol implementation. So by that way, Suricata needs to parse everything and anything on the network, and trust me, everything and anything on the network doesn't fold the RFC, it just doesn't. So we need to follow the RFC one, and two, we don't, because we can't, you know, we can't crash, we need to actually keep inspecting and alert for problems. Suricata has, not everybody, a lot of organization, a lot of tools have vulnerability based on protocol parsers. Workshack has a lot, Suricata has a few and similar. So one way to battle and combat that is the combination of Rust and known for, memory safety, trust safety, C is not safe, right, C's memory requires a manual, if it's not done correctly, it's not done properly, SecFalse Memlix, they can all occur in there. There is an example of Rust known parser that we use in Suricata, so Suricata is a combination of C and Rust known implementation, and that started only a couple years ago, and it's more and more of that, just to help us be more safe when we inspect and do things. There's the outside evolution, right, so networks' speeds increase, demand increases, there is encryption, there is less visibility, but a lot of data. I was earlier, in January, I had a talk at a different conference, and after the talk, a person approached me, he's like, do you have any recommendations of how to tune or improve Suricata performance, I'm like, yeah, sure, he's like, and I said, what's your setup? He's like, we have over 25, 100 giblets, I'm like, okay, we need to talk, so it's very interesting, things like that are dominant and happening, so it's different, you need to keep up with those evolutions, too, and make sure that these people actually, these setups and people can benefit from everything we do. Challenges, there's a lot, everything from mirroring the traffic to one side, the traffic to encryption, to nick-off loading, because we actually do need to inspect the traffic as the end user or the end device, we'll see it, not as the devices in the network pass it over to one another. Volume, size of logs, it's not uncommon to have, depending on the link speed, of course, it's not uncommon to have one, two, three, five more billion of logs a day, what do we do with them? That's a different topic. So here it comes, the deduplication and all the stuff that we actually also need to take care of. And QA anyone while we're at this? It's quite an effort. So when we talk about encryption, I mentioned, so depending on the protocol version and similar things you have, TLS12, 113, 11, all sorts of things, but during the clear and shake, you can actually extract a lot of information, these are some of the things that we extract actually, the SNI, the subject, the shore, you can deduct cipher codes from there as well, J3J3S, fingerprinting, TLS version is similar. So we need to tell sort of what to do when it detects that the connection is encrypted. So what do you do? You want to keep inspecting it? It might be pointless because it's encrypted or you want to pass it to a specific, some hardware has already built in function so it can say bypass it on the hardware level as soon as it detects it's encrypted because there's nothing more we can do. And there's certain things that we can continue on tracking and generate logs, for example, the flow, how big is it and things like that, but we need to be able to relate that information because it's pointless, as I mentioned, if it's encrypted. There's also a lot of decryption devices and similar things that Suricada 6 next to or behind, but that's a setup, that's an architecture issue. So these four major factors that impact Suricada performance, rules, Suricada version, hardware use and type of traffic. Again university traffic is much more different than a regular corporate traffic where everything is vetted. So you learn a lot from both deployments, for example, just using these two as an example. We're software, right? So we need to run on any hardware and that's not easy to achieve. We need a lot of persistence queuing and all those similar things. So what actually happens, so here's an example of workers more than Suricada. As you can see, this is a network card and it has different queues and each protocol, sorry, each thread, each record actually enters and goes through these points, capture the cold stream, detect output, output, especially when you write in. So it needs to be in, this is an example of that specific order. When the traffic comes to the network, how it's passed to the Suricada and what Suricada goes through on a very high level. Most of NICs are made for web file servers at scale. They're not specifically made for IDEs, some are, but IDEs needs to see the traffic. The network security monitoring needs to see the traffic as this end device will actually see it in order. Everything needs to be in order in the same flow so that we can expect it properly. And a small word, so back in the day when I started, there was different capture methods and they evolved over time. But one of the fastest things that was back there was PF ring. And that was actually, we received a lot of help from Luca and Alfredo. Thank you guys. So Colonel 2.6 and 2.6, yeah, PF ring was the only thing that offered speed and performance. There's others that we were upcoming in the Suricada 7, you know, DPDKF, IKTXDP and similar, but we need to have different methods. I am going just to finish up here. And so QA in Suricada, a lot of, we need to cover a lot of angles. We have code on GitHub, we have code in GitLab. When you submit a PR publicly, it goes through an automated checks to as much as possible before we put it in the code. There's private ones, there's unit sets, there's thousands of checks. So anytime you submit a PR or a code, it automatically triggers checks. And some of them could finish nightly. This is a GitLab screenshot going through some checks. Some of these checks can include thousands of definitions inside. In one check, we have 22,000 files extracted, we need to make sure all of them are there the same way they were there before the code change. Things like that need to happen. And here's an example of a PR that's going through a regular checks on GitHub. But information is actually public on GitHub, you can see it in all the different OS compilations that it goes through. Address sanitizers, leak sanitizers, code analysis, CPP checks, all those things need to actually happen before we can say, okay, we could put this code without affecting us. Regressions, traffic replacement, similar. I am going over with a time apologize. This is how to contribute. Any feature and code can be donated, put on our red mine ticket and start a discussion. And the current reviews could be done on GitHub, they're public. So in conclusion, it has to work because you need to create a community around it. And the power is in the community because it's, you have a lot of ideas, a lot of feedback and you need to be open about it, you need to have open discussions about roadmap and input from all the different people that are actually using it. And that is the, our point is that is the ultimate power comes in numbers. Thank you very much for having me here. Much appreciated. Open to questions. Thank you Peter. Anybody has one question? One question here. So I'm just wondering, I don't know what the current date is, but you have MPF Bluefield as well, and how else does it sort of pay that increase? Have I looked? I'm sorry, I'm didn't hear. MPF Bluefield. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. We have a conversation going. Yes.
