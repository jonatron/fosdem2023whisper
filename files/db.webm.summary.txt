Ida Pugja gave a talk at FOSDEM conference in 2023 about monitoring databases with open source tools, focusing on Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM). She discussed the importance of monitoring databases, the challenges in doing so, and the value of using PMM. She shared some of the metrics that can be monitored through PMM, including query performance, high CPU, high memory usage, disk usage, and user connections. Ida also briefly demonstrated PMM's dashboard and how it can be used to monitor specific nodes and databases. During the Q&A session, she answered questions about advice on improving slow queries and filtering queries by connection instead of by database.
