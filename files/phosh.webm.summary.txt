The talk is about the Hosh graphical shell for Wayland and its developments in the past year, including swiping gestures, quality of life improvements, lock screen plugins, and encrypted media streams. The talk also mentions adaptive applications and collaboration between different projects and distributions. There is a very brief Q&A session at the end.
