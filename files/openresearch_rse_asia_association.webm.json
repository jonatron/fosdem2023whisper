{"text": " Hello, everyone. My name is Saranjeet and I'll be presenting a talk on establishing the research software engineering Asia association with the open life science program here at FOSDEM 2023. A bit about myself. I'm based in India, a country in Asia. I'm the lead and co-founder of the RSC Asia association and an international fellow of the software sustainability Institute's 2023 inauguration. The RSC Asia association was started based on open science principles of inclusion, fairness, equity and sharing. These principles and values have had a huge impact on how we structured the association and continue to grow in the process. A huge support in this journey was provided by the open life science program, also called as the OLS program. It is a 16 week long personal mentorship and cohort based training for participants interested in applying open science principles in their work and becoming open science ambassadors in their communities. Through the 16 weeks, the organizers, hosts, mentors and project leads or mentees share their expertise and gain knowledge essential to create, lead and sustain an open science project, connect with members across different projects, communities, backgrounds and identities and empower each other to become effective open science ambassadors in their communities. Participants join this program with a project not limited to life science that they are either already working on or want to develop during this program individually or in teams. As of February 2023, the open life science is on the way to host its seventh cohort. Check their website openlifeside.org to learn more about this fantastic program. We started RSC Asia association as a community building project during the cohort four of the open life science program. During this cohort, we developed infrastructure like the website, the social media handle, the GitHub organization of the RSC Asia association. Finally, we officially launched the RSC Asia association in October 2021. We continued the journey of building RSC Asia with cohort five of the open life science program. During this program, we created a working group for RSC Asia as a pathway for on-boarding. There were also further research done on adopting a code of conduct. We established the RSC Asia association with a mission to promote and build the research software engineering community and profession in the Asian region while also fostering global collaborations. We continue to conduct various activities at RSC Asia. At our launch event, we encouraged our community to participate in the Hacktoberfest 2021 program. We organized a workshop on learn how to write all text for scientific diagrams in September in July 2022. In September 2022, we organized the first RSC Asia Australia on conference in collaboration with RSC Australia. This on conference was well received and got a positive feedback from the community members. We participated in Hacktoberfest 2022 and held co-working sessions for our community during the month of October 2022. The RSC Asia association has grown since its launch and we have community members from different parts of the globe. The community membership of RSC Asia association is free and open to all. People from all regions of the globe are welcome to join our community irrespective of whether they belong to or are located in Asia. To become a community member of RSC Asia, please fill the membership form. We are also planning to host community calls at RSC Asia. Please share your suggestions, ideas and thoughts for the same with us. Thank you for joining and watching my talk. You can follow the RSC Asia Twitter handle at the rate RSC underscore Asia to know more about the community activities. Thank you again.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.120000000000001, "text": " Hello, everyone.
