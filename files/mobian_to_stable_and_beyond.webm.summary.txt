This talk explored the progress of the Mobian project over the past two years, which is a Debian derivative designed to target mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The presenter announced plans to release a stable Mobian version, which would include support for a variety of devices, two flavors of Mobian (Fosh and SXMO), an LTS kernel, semi-universal images, an improved mobile ecosystem, and more. The goal of Mobian is to ultimately be assimilated completely into Debian.
