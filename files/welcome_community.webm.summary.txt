The speaker is Leslie Hawthorne, co-organizer of the community Dev Room at FOSDEM 2023, a conference about free and open source software development. She welcomes the attendees and gives a few housekeeping remarks, such as marking vegan and vegetarian baked goods and providing air filtration for the Dev Room. The talk mainly covers the logistics of the event and some light banter between Leslie and Matt, the next speaker who will be talking about external evangelists and how to build them. There is also a brief mention of the FOSDEM code of conduct and the availability of masks for those who need them.
