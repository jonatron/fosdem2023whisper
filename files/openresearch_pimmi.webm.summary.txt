In this talk, Beatrice from the French Media Lab presented PIMI, a tool to study image propagation. It is able to group together images that are total or partial copies of each other and can adapt to copper's characteristics. It is not able to detect semantically similar images or do face recognition. Beatrice also discussed how PIMI could be used for social media analytics, press analysis, fake news detection, and editorial comparisons.
