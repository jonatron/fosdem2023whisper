The talk presented the open conversation kit, or TOC, an open platform written in Kotlin for building chatbots, voicebots, callbots, and conversational agents. The platform was built by SNCF Connect and Tech, the French railway company, to create production-ready business-to-customer chatbots. The talk demonstrated how to create a chatbot running Kotlin from scratch and integrate it with OpenNLP or Stanford NLP libraries. The talk also showcased how chatbots can integrate with AI-powered models like chat GPT for answering any question without code, but also showed how companies can create custom stories to control the results and guarantee predictability.
