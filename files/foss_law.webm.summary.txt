The talk, given by Sarah Dain Whitfield at the FOSDEM conference, discusses the concept of unauthorized practice of law in the context of free and open source software development. She explores the case of Do Not Pay, a company that faced legal issues when their AI-powered robot lawyer was deemed to be practicing law without a license. Sarah highlights that the definition of the practice of law varies from state to state in the US, making it difficult to determine what actions may cross the line into unauthorized practice. She also addresses the public policy rationale behind regulating the practice of law, which is primarily focused on consumer protection. The talk includes three notable cases: Jance vs. LegalZoom, TIKT vs. the Florida Bar Association, and InRe Peterson. In these cases, companies providing legal services or advice without proper licensing were found to be engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. Sarah concludes by raising open-ended questions about the potential impact of unauthorized practice of law regulations on open source projects, particularly in relation to licenses and disclaimers.
