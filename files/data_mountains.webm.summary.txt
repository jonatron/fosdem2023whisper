The speaker, a Python programmer who works with geospatial data in local government, discussed the challenge of visualizing census data on population density. They explained that the unevenly distributed data made it difficult to use a coropleth map, so they experimented with different techniques such as log transformation, cartograms, and symbol plots from non-Python sources, but ultimately created a fun hand-drawn mountain visual using Python. They also explored other data sets such as the number of one, two, three, and four-bedroom homes in specific areas, and emphasized the importance of good coding practices like those encouraged by NB Dev. The speaker also gave shoutouts to the Sejourner OX app and an upcoming talk on OSM and Wikidata.
