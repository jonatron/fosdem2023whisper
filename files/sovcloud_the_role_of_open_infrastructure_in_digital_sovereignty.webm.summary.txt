Thierry Carras, from the Open Infrastructure Foundation, explains the concept of digital sovereignty, the challenges that Europe faces in regards to infrastructure, and how open infrastructure can help. Digital sovereignty, the ability to control and have access to data, is important in a fast-changing world that is heavily driven by software. European companies need access to programmable infrastructure, but the cloud market is cornered by a few internal US and Chinese giants, creating geopolitical vulnerabilities. Open infrastructure offers independence, transparency, and interoperability necessary to federate a group of local actors, such as Germany and France, that compete with these US-based giants. The Sovereign Cloud Stack Project aims to build a standard stack for providing sovereign infrastructure and enabling a federation of highly interoperable infrastructure providers.
