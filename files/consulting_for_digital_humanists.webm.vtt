00:00.000 --> 00:12.240
So, my name is Marie DubromÃ©, Constructing for Digital Humanists, The Cultural Shock,

00:12.240 --> 00:18.400
Be Developing Tools and Pedagogy. This talk is given on behalf of the Center for Digital

00:18.400 --> 00:24.680
Humanities in Uppsala, which is where I work. Here you have my contact. You can contact

00:24.680 --> 00:35.240
me via email, mastodon, as well as my website. I'm an engineer in digital humanities. We'll

00:35.240 --> 00:41.120
come back on that later. What you need to know is that I'm located in two countries,

00:41.120 --> 00:48.800
in the city of Lille in France and in Uppsala, where my work and university is. And on my

00:48.800 --> 00:58.000
spare time, I'm an activist in Uppsala Women's Coding, as well as sometimes in Ulug and Raoul

00:58.000 --> 01:06.520
in Lille and Uppsala. So, I'm not the first digital humanist you are encountering in the

01:06.520 --> 01:15.760
first day. I did a little bit of a survey, and so at least four people I could identify

01:15.760 --> 01:21.320
the digital humanists in the past, as the name of Jan Jonsson, Vanilly, Guido, Oly de

01:21.320 --> 01:28.560
Ober, Antoine Fosche. Thank you to them for opening the path and just being pioneer and

01:28.560 --> 01:39.360
indirectly making me feel welcome in coming to your community. So, without further introduction,

01:39.360 --> 01:49.960
what is digital humanities? It's a pretty new field, and it's a blurry term. I'm not

01:49.960 --> 01:54.960
going to have the talk of three days and three nights without sleeping about how to define

01:54.960 --> 02:02.680
it. What you need to know is that it's the field in the intersections between computer

02:02.680 --> 02:10.960
science and humanities, all sorts of humanities. And what in this context an engineer in digital

02:10.960 --> 02:18.360
humanities is, it's someone technical that will have expertise in one or several domain

02:18.360 --> 02:25.880
of computer science and whose mission is to help humanists in their projects. By humanists

02:25.880 --> 02:36.920
we can mean a philosopher, literature analyst, historian, sociology, archaeology, etc., etc.

02:36.920 --> 02:44.440
I thought to give you a bit of context, examples would talk more than a long discourse. So,

02:44.440 --> 02:51.840
if you're an engineer in digital humanities, you could be helping a theologist mapping

02:51.840 --> 03:00.400
all the colors of the Bible to show the color ambience of the New Testament. You could be

03:00.400 --> 03:09.840
also building an online databases to help an art historian will be broadcasting their

03:09.840 --> 03:22.240
anti-copedical knowledge about some engravings of books, etc., etc. You do not need to read

03:22.240 --> 03:31.560
this complicated table, but I will attract your attention to a couple of things. First,

03:31.560 --> 03:38.240
observe the subjects. The subjects are pretty academics, academic subjects, things that

03:38.240 --> 03:46.240
computer scientists will normally not be very familiar to, like literatures, Scandinavian

03:46.240 --> 03:55.040
languages, linguistics, here the ALM means the archives, etc., etc. We have an audience

03:55.040 --> 04:01.120
of very academic people, people that have no contact with the corporate world, that

04:01.120 --> 04:09.080
have been in academia and stayed in academia after. Look at this, we have a pretty gender

04:09.080 --> 04:15.240
balanced group and slightly actually female dominated. I counted 16 women here in this

04:15.240 --> 04:25.400
room, including me. So, that's an interesting contrast. Finally, the titles, it probably

04:25.400 --> 04:34.240
doesn't speak to you too much because it's a pretty specialized topic. Could we even say

04:34.240 --> 04:45.840
niche topics? I had fun making a table of the differences between the engineering world

04:45.840 --> 04:52.280
and the humanistic world. By the way, I have a background in classics before going to natural

04:52.280 --> 04:58.640
language processing, so I'm accustomed to this switch of culture. Additionally to the

04:58.640 --> 05:06.400
remarks I have made, I will add that among engineers and computer scientists, the programming

05:06.400 --> 05:13.640
is the norm, and often as an operating system, you will see Linux or Mac, or at least when

05:13.640 --> 05:17.840
I was in the Department of Natural Language Processing, that was what I was seeing. You

05:17.840 --> 05:24.200
would use an academic context, you would exchange terminal apps, et cetera, et cetera. Whereas

05:24.200 --> 05:30.320
if you land in the Department of Humanities, you will have a point and click as a norm

05:30.320 --> 05:37.120
and offer proprietary tools as a norm. Windows, Mac, PowerPoint, Word, I have been asked in

05:37.120 --> 05:44.760
conferences to give PowerPoint, PPTX, files and Word documents, and no one gets offended

05:44.760 --> 06:02.480
by that. So industry influence, academic, and I think finally the most important is

06:02.480 --> 06:10.760
that in computer science, we are very metrics oriented, optimizing maybe speed or other

06:10.760 --> 06:23.080
quantified performances, whereas the humanists are very question oriented. So between those

06:23.080 --> 06:27.600
two different audience that we need to gather in digital humanities, how do we help each

06:27.600 --> 06:40.160
others? And to be able to continue my talk or let's say end my talk in something positive,

06:40.160 --> 06:52.480
I will start in the, let's say, more obstacles or negative points of trying this marriage

06:52.480 --> 07:00.160
between the two fields. I think if you want to have free software, computer science and

07:00.160 --> 07:09.960
free software in the digital humanities, you need to overcome a lack of visibility from

07:09.960 --> 07:18.000
the free software world towards the humanists. And I think this versa. And I thought of taking

07:18.000 --> 07:26.320
short example of technical tools we are working with. So in digital humanities, I'm specialized

07:26.320 --> 07:34.440
in web scraping and NLP. And us as engineers, we tend to use, I would say, open source tools

07:34.440 --> 07:44.600
like Python, beautiful soup and spacey, whereas people that will be less computer savvy in

07:44.600 --> 07:54.000
digital humanities will use more proprietary software such as web scrapper.io or Antconk,

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
which has the advantage to be point and click tools, to be simpler, more straightforward,

07:59.000 --> 08:07.600
to have less functionalities as well. And yes, another remark is that I noticed recently

08:07.600 --> 08:13.440
while giving courses to digital humanists that people are asking me if I can teach them

08:13.440 --> 08:20.640
GitHub. And they say, no, I can teach you GitHub. So it's very revealing the fact that

08:20.640 --> 08:25.880
they don't even know the difference or what it means. So it's very revealing that they

08:25.880 --> 08:32.560
know GitHub before understanding the notion of Git. So I think this is to stress my point

08:32.560 --> 08:37.080
about lack of visibility of the open source world or maybe the over visibility of the

08:37.080 --> 08:47.400
freeware world. The second obstacle to bringing free software to digital humanists is maybe

08:47.400 --> 08:57.000
a lack of cohesion. I mean, digital humanities is a nascent topic where we have a lot of

08:57.000 --> 09:02.560
groups already spread with different languages, digital historians, digital literature analysts,

09:02.560 --> 09:08.840
et cetera, et cetera. And so they have already had time gathering together. So in this context,

09:08.840 --> 09:15.960
it's hard to make as well a community of open source answers. Yes, so it's not yet built

09:15.960 --> 09:26.680
this community in this context. The next thing I will point or obstacle is I would say the

09:26.680 --> 09:34.320
lack of common references or I would say of, but not of common values. So it's hard to

09:34.320 --> 09:41.560
find a language to understand each other. I will come back on that in the positive points.

09:41.560 --> 09:52.600
And yeah, that's it for the obstacles I can see. Then on the positive points on what could

09:52.600 --> 10:02.600
make this marriage a success, we have first, I think we humanists will be a very receptive

10:02.600 --> 10:09.200
audience to the philosophy of free software. I mean, enlightenment, philosophy existed

10:09.200 --> 10:14.400
in before, and it was a study in humanities, and it was a study in humanities before which

10:14.400 --> 10:25.200
A Starman was born. And so they have those references and those references to philosophy

10:25.200 --> 10:35.280
and value of spreading the knowledge of sharing and so on. They have a lot of activism in

10:35.280 --> 10:42.320
them. I mean, half of my department is vegan, such reveal something about them. There are

10:42.320 --> 10:51.560
nascent but varied community, and I think that's a positive point. It's a crowd that

10:51.560 --> 11:04.040
is diverse, very unusual for our dev crowd. Something non-neglectable, they have financial

11:04.040 --> 11:14.200
means. The humanities in general do not have much financial needs, not as much as science,

11:14.200 --> 11:20.400
but digital humanists are attracting grants and subsidies for projects, and that's an

11:20.400 --> 11:29.200
indirect way to finance open source and free software. I'm an engineer developing tools

11:29.200 --> 11:34.720
for digital humanists, and my salary is paid by the government because digital humanities

11:34.720 --> 11:45.640
is such a buzzword. Finally, one very interesting thing about this crowd is that they know about

11:45.640 --> 11:51.560
domains that maybe engineers and computer scientists have interest on, but do not have

11:51.560 --> 11:59.160
a formal training on. A lot of them have training or have access easily to training on. Communication

11:59.160 --> 12:07.120
and science of education, ethics, and are trained to think critically all the time.

12:07.120 --> 12:14.640
I will end my presentation not in certitudes, but in doubts and questions. The questions

12:14.640 --> 12:23.600
we could have are ideas to reach better this community and how to make them feel welcome.

12:23.600 --> 12:30.600
That was it for my talk. I just kept for illustration purpose in case I have questions

12:30.600 --> 12:41.040
I happen to have prepared. References here, all in the slides. Thank you.

12:41.040 --> 13:07.840
Are you aware of the research software engineering movement that's been going on for about the

13:07.840 --> 13:13.160
last 10 years? Are you aware of the research software engineering movement that's been

13:13.160 --> 13:16.440
going on for about 10 years now? There's quite an active group in the Nordic countries

13:16.440 --> 13:20.360
and in the UK that have a lot of common issues with what you've just been talking about.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.160
There will be a very good community for you to get involved with.

13:23.160 --> 13:30.600
I don't know. Is it any linked with the dev room of yesterday about the research tools?

13:30.600 --> 13:33.080
I don't know. I wasn't in that dev room.

13:33.080 --> 13:41.440
Thank you for your remark. Please come to me after and I will write that down.

13:41.440 --> 13:59.120
We have one minute left. Yes. Thank you.

13:59.120 --> 14:06.160
How could you suggest to approach someone in the humanist sector that maybe needs a hand

14:06.160 --> 14:11.080
with the project but doesn't really know what can IT do for it?

14:11.080 --> 14:19.200
Does it really know what we do? I had a set of questions when I do consulting.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.960
I can read them to you. First, context. What is your domain?

14:22.960 --> 14:26.480
What does your domain focus on? Because they can be very varied.

14:26.480 --> 14:32.160
What is the problem you try to solve? Eventually, what did you already try to solve your problem?

14:32.160 --> 14:36.840
What tools did you use? That will give you an idea because they will be very blurry about

14:36.840 --> 14:43.240
what they want that will help anchoring. What are the data you have and hope to collect

14:43.240 --> 14:47.960
and they rarely think about it? And finally, and the most important, can you present me

14:47.960 --> 14:53.440
your data? Screenshots. Open your, probably they have an Excel file or something, whatever.

14:53.440 --> 15:01.080
Size. Format. How has it been collected? And things you think, or as a computer scientist,

15:01.080 --> 15:06.200
quantification, they don't think like that. They just think questions. So I think that

15:06.200 --> 15:07.720
could help. Thank you.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.080
You're welcome. Thanks, everyone.

15:10.080 --> 15:24.160
A big round of applause.
