WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
So, thank you. I'm Aurora from the University of Murcia.

00:09.480 --> 00:12.120
And I'm Michael from the University of Passau.

00:12.120 --> 00:16.320
And we will be presenting the NGA Search and OpenWeb Search.U projects.

00:16.320 --> 00:22.960
Two sister initiatives for a paradigm change in open search and discovery on the internet.

00:22.960 --> 00:27.640
We will have a common introduction and then each of us will delve in the projects that

00:27.640 --> 00:29.960
we are involved in.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.960
The short disclaimer before we start, in the last two days at FOSTA, we have heard a lot

00:33.960 --> 00:37.440
about personal lifetime projects.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.400
This is quite different because it's not personal.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.880
These are European institutions involved.

00:43.880 --> 00:49.520
And it's not lifetime, but these projects, they are just starting up and have nice ideas

00:49.520 --> 00:52.800
and require your attention and contribution.

00:52.800 --> 01:01.200
So, NGA Search is a European project that will welcome entrepreneurs, tech-dates, developers

01:01.200 --> 01:08.040
and socially engaged people that have challenging ideas about the way that we will search and

01:08.040 --> 01:11.080
discover information and data on the internet.

01:11.080 --> 01:19.880
So basically, we will find projects that are focusing on several topics that I will explain

01:19.880 --> 01:26.320
in a minute and they are compliant with the European values of openness, transparency,

01:26.320 --> 01:28.400
privacy and trust.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.280
The applicants can be natural persons and organizations and they can apply individually

01:32.280 --> 01:37.720
or as a consortium of three members of a team.

01:37.720 --> 01:43.960
OpenWeb Search is a project funded by the EU and has the goal of developing an open European

01:43.960 --> 01:46.160
infrastructure for a web search.

01:46.160 --> 01:53.120
There are several research and computing centers involved and the project started in September

01:53.120 --> 01:56.920
last year and has a time frame of three years.

01:56.920 --> 02:02.240
It's quite interesting that it's the first project which is funded by the EU and has

02:02.240 --> 02:06.760
the goal of developing Europe's own web index.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.680
And for those who don't know, a web index is a data structure which allows the vast

02:10.680 --> 02:13.040
access of web data.

02:13.040 --> 02:22.840
It is the fundamental core of all current search engines and it enables the development

02:22.840 --> 02:31.240
of all kind of web search and web data retrieval services.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.400
So for us, let me present you the project partners.

02:34.400 --> 02:39.680
We are Link Novene, Aros University, the University of Murcia, OW2, a funding box.

02:39.680 --> 02:43.480
These are some of our phases.

02:43.480 --> 02:47.680
We will organize five different open calls and we will welcome these innovative projects.

02:47.680 --> 02:54.680
We will provide them financial support up to 150,000 euros and as well we will not only

02:54.680 --> 02:59.440
provide financial but also technical, business and innovation support and the projects are

02:59.440 --> 03:03.160
expected to take 12 months.

03:03.160 --> 03:11.400
The first open call is already closed, the evaluation is ongoing and it was a technological

03:11.400 --> 03:19.160
based call, meaning that we were looking for products, finalized products.

03:19.160 --> 03:24.440
And then we will select nine to 10 projects in the topics that you see on the screen,

03:24.440 --> 03:30.600
base voice assistants, NLP, semantic analysis, social computing and data visualization.

03:30.600 --> 03:36.680
But let me delve a little bit more on the second open call topics which may caught your

03:36.680 --> 03:37.680
attention.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.800
I hope you can resonate with some of them.

03:39.800 --> 03:44.880
The second open call will open in April, the first of April and it's a little bit more

03:44.880 --> 03:52.760
research oriented but please have a look because we have plenty of space for everything.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.320
And let me explain each topic.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.520
The first one is power cognitive search by reinforcement learning.

03:58.520 --> 04:04.960
Today we look for mechanisms of self-learning and all kinds of algorithms that can contribute

04:04.960 --> 04:11.480
to our reinforcement learning system that is able to then with the interactions how

04:11.480 --> 04:16.280
to choose the right data and algorithms in order to make any search more relevant towards

04:16.280 --> 04:19.640
the objective of it.

04:19.640 --> 04:23.400
Then the second topic is machine based data, Internet of Things data.

04:23.400 --> 04:29.440
Today we look for algorithms for search and pattern discovery that are adapted or that

04:29.440 --> 04:38.720
can adapt to IOT characteristics which means we will look for edge computing, times, algorithms

04:38.720 --> 04:45.200
that can deal with time series, with events, with different localizations and so on.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.520
We have also AI based taxonomies.

04:47.520 --> 04:53.320
We look for the automatic creation and expansion of existing taxonomies that are machine based

04:53.320 --> 04:59.160
and machine interpretable semantics by using AI techniques.

04:59.160 --> 05:03.760
Basically we want to model the interdependency among new concepts so we want to adapt to

05:03.760 --> 05:08.200
the dynamic and the dynamicity of the data.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.280
The next topic is network analysis.

05:11.280 --> 05:18.680
Basically we want to find other ways to create knowledge graphs which are an interlinked network

05:18.680 --> 05:21.520
of distributed resources that can be searched.

05:21.520 --> 05:27.360
We can do this looking for, the objective can be to make them more scalable, to test

05:27.360 --> 05:35.080
the quality of the creative models, to create different semantics, to make them compliant

05:35.080 --> 05:39.160
with diversity and dynamicity of data and so on.

05:39.160 --> 05:44.840
Then we have AI based search tools and content generators.

05:44.840 --> 05:49.880
As you know nowadays AI based content generators are quite popular.

05:49.880 --> 05:58.680
Here I have some names that have been coming up in FOSM many times, check GPT, GitHub co-pilot,

05:58.680 --> 05:59.680
co-PAI.

05:59.680 --> 06:04.880
So we welcome projects that can help evaluate the privacy of these kind of tools.

06:04.880 --> 06:09.960
Also look for research at the logical gaps on them as well as the completeness of their

06:09.960 --> 06:11.560
answers.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.320
Then we have the topic of ethics in search and discovery.

06:14.320 --> 06:22.480
We want to have projects that specifically focus on testing that the developments of

06:22.480 --> 06:26.880
search and discovery are compliant with human rights, that they are not biased towards

06:26.880 --> 06:38.240
minorities, towards gender, so that they promote equality but also private, they are private

06:38.240 --> 06:43.920
and they take care of the data confidentiality.

06:43.920 --> 06:48.480
And finally we have new ways of discovering and accessing information, which is a broad

06:48.480 --> 06:51.960
topic so that we don't leave anything behind.

06:51.960 --> 06:52.960
How are we going to do that?

06:52.960 --> 06:57.640
We are going to provide technology mentoring and advice on technologies to access store

06:57.640 --> 07:04.680
managed data and also on algorithms and the platforms are tailored to the projects.

07:04.680 --> 07:09.880
We are going to leverage the reach out beta testing platforms, a platform for beta testing

07:09.880 --> 07:13.440
campaigns, then we are going to link the projects to different standards and promote

07:13.440 --> 07:18.800
the conversations with different foundations that will be related to them.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.240
We will have a program for market readiness.

07:21.240 --> 07:31.360
We will create workshops for pitch training so that they can try to pitch their solution

07:31.360 --> 07:36.040
or their project to potential investors and users.

07:36.040 --> 07:41.000
Business modeling advice and coaching and as for innovation, we will give information

07:41.000 --> 07:47.920
about which kind of open source license they can have, they can use, how to manage it and

07:47.920 --> 07:56.040
how to make their research and their solutions reproducible so following open science principles.

07:56.040 --> 08:02.080
So as to conclude for my part, the next three years there will be five open calls that will

08:02.080 --> 08:08.240
challenge the way that we search and discover information on the Internet.

08:08.240 --> 08:14.200
We have synergies with the NDI mission of looking for a more human centric Internet

08:14.200 --> 08:19.920
and these are our core values, open source, contributions to the wider community, collaboration

08:19.920 --> 08:25.440
and open science principles as well as transversal challenges that include sustainability and

08:25.440 --> 08:26.440
equality.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.200
I give the floor to my colleague.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.320
Thanks.

08:31.320 --> 08:36.840
So now switching to the second system project, open web surge.

08:36.840 --> 08:44.440
As I said before, there are several computing and research centers involved in the project

08:44.440 --> 08:49.880
and it's good this way because all of these have different competences like universities

08:49.880 --> 08:55.440
or businesses and this underlines one specific point about the project.

08:55.440 --> 09:02.200
In contrary to the web index which is operated by Google for example, this project does not

09:02.200 --> 09:10.960
follow a centralized approach but it tries to build up a web index collaboratively and

09:10.960 --> 09:16.800
distributed among several European institutions otherwise it would just not be possible to

09:16.800 --> 09:24.360
build up a web index from scratch.

09:24.360 --> 09:29.160
I will keep the motivation short because it should be clear why it is a good idea to have

09:29.160 --> 09:36.160
your own web index in Europe, the first thing is the imbalance in the surge engine market.

09:36.160 --> 09:46.680
There are four big global web indexes out there from big tech companies and this dominance

09:46.680 --> 09:52.800
of these companies has a lot of negative effects on the critical infrastructure web

09:52.800 --> 09:59.120
surge so to say and the solution is to strive for more plurality.

09:59.120 --> 10:07.800
Another thing is that web data is a driver for innovations and an example, just one

10:07.800 --> 10:13.840
out of many examples that has drawn a lot of attention lately is the training of large

10:13.840 --> 10:25.440
language models such as JetGPT which works on its basis with web data.

10:25.440 --> 10:33.680
The project goals are developing the core of an open web index so two remarks on this

10:33.680 --> 10:43.320
point, this will be done with open source and open configuration and it is not expected

10:43.320 --> 10:50.360
that at the end of the three years of the project there will be a production ready index

10:50.360 --> 11:00.480
but the goal is to have an index which contains at least 50% of all text web pages and then

11:00.480 --> 11:06.440
that can be worked on and that shows as a prototype that it is possible to create it

11:06.440 --> 11:12.760
collaboratively and distributed among several institutions.

11:12.760 --> 11:18.640
Another goal is to build an ecosystem around the index and make it publicly available in

11:18.640 --> 11:20.240
this way.

11:20.240 --> 11:25.840
As I said before it serves as a feasibility study in some way to show that it is possible

11:25.840 --> 11:32.640
to do it collaboratively and that is why along the way it should be established a network

11:32.640 --> 11:38.400
among European infrastructure partners.

11:38.400 --> 11:45.800
The overall vision of the project is to give open access for innovators and businesses and

11:45.800 --> 11:55.960
researchers on web data to enable them to build new business ideas for example or to

11:55.960 --> 12:02.980
work on their ideas on web search and web analysis.

12:02.980 --> 12:11.280
As for the NGI search project there are also ways to contribute to openwebsurge.u through

12:11.280 --> 12:17.720
third party calls there will be three public calls with a fixed amount of funding and the

12:17.720 --> 12:22.840
first of them focuses on the legal aspects of the project.

12:22.840 --> 12:29.680
There are two tracks the first one focuses contributions on legal and business and social

12:29.680 --> 12:36.560
aspects of web search in general and the second track focuses on the legal compliance of the

12:36.560 --> 12:44.540
crawling so the acquisition of the data from the internet which is then stored in the index.

12:44.540 --> 12:50.200
This call will open on the first of March this year.

12:50.200 --> 12:58.000
There are also other opportunities to contribute which is covered by the upcoming calls and

12:58.000 --> 13:06.360
this course overview of the architecture should just give you a hint on where these contributions

13:06.360 --> 13:16.120
can be located so if you have an idea on how to develop a search and discovery application

13:16.120 --> 13:27.480
this can be done for example as a vertical search engine on top of the web index infrastructure

13:27.480 --> 13:34.120
or it can be a content analysis method which enriches the data which is then stored in

13:34.120 --> 13:39.200
the index.

13:39.200 --> 13:46.680
So as a conclusion the openwebsurge.u project wants to open up web search and strives for

13:46.680 --> 13:56.920
more plurality to give new business ideas a chance and new alternative search engines

13:56.920 --> 14:05.960
a chance therefore the project partners collaborate and build up an European open web index which

14:05.960 --> 14:09.640
is then publicly available.

14:09.640 --> 14:15.520
For researchers innovators and businesses there is the possibility to contribute either

14:15.520 --> 14:24.160
by developing your own business model which sets upon the open web index or by involving

14:24.160 --> 14:27.520
in one of the three public calls.

14:27.520 --> 14:32.560
The first one of them as I said opens on the first of March.

14:32.560 --> 14:54.960
So thanks for your attention and we open for questions.
