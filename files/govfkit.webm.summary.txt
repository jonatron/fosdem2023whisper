The speaker discussed VFKit, a macOS hypervisor based on the Hyper Utilization Framework. VFKit allows developers to run an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster on their Mac laptops for testing and development purposes. The speaker explained that while QEMU is an option for creating virtual machines on macOS, they chose VFKit because it is maintained by Apple and provides a high-level API for creating and managing virtual machines. However, since VFKit is written in Objective-C, they needed to use Go bindings to interact with it. The speaker demonstrated examples of calling Objective-C code from Go and explained how VFKit keeps the virtual machine alive by maintaining a separate process that runs alongside it. They also discussed the advantages and challenges of using Objective-C in Go and how VFKit simplifies the process of creating and managing virtual machines on macOS. The speaker concluded by mentioning the availability of VFKit on GitHub and provided contact information for further questions.
