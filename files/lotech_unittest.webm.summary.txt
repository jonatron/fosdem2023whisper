The speaker, Cisco Foley, discusses how he cleaned up the unit test code used by the Document Foundation in the last month. He explains that the code was failing due to missing teardown method disposing on MX component and he started to look for other places where this kind of problem may happen in unit tests. Foley found a lot of duplicates in the code and removed them to make the code more efficient. He also merged some classes and added support for password importing and exporting. Further, he talks about the problem with custom asserts and how he fixed them. In the end, he dropped a lot of duplicated code and made the whole process more easy and efficient.
