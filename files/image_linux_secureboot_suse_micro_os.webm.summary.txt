In this talk, Ignas Foster discusses open-source and micro-S and the related technical details, a product of the open-source universe. It is based on existing products such as tumbleweed and leap, and is meant for single-purpose systems, such as running containers. It is self-maintaining and uses mainly read-only root file systems with BDRIV-S snapshot capabilities. The talk also covers update and rollback mechanisms and configuration file management.
