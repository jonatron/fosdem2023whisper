The talk was about the open research track at FOSDEM, a conference on free and open source software development. The speaker explained how they created the track as a venue for discussing technical realizations in the lab that were difficult to publish through traditional scientific channels. They emphasized the importance of diversity in terms of gender and disciplines, and expressed a need for more submissions from users and non-developers. They also encouraged participation from academia and suggested reaching out to PhD student associations. The speaker mentioned the challenge of balancing the selection of tool talks with other types of discussions and expressed interest in exploring different presentation formats. They also discussed the high acceptance rate for submissions, but noted the difficulty in attracting certain types of talks. The discussion touched on the need to integrate usability and user design into research and the possibility of collaborating with the open design dev room. The talk concluded with an invitation to join the online session and an invitation to drinks after the session.
