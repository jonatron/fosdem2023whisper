00:00.000 --> 00:15.840
Hello. So, one quick question for the next speakers. Can you please identify yourself

00:15.840 --> 00:22.880
towards us then? So, Karen, who's the next one? Sarah James. Sarah James. So, if you're

00:22.880 --> 00:30.840
around, then please come to Karen. So, our next speaker here is Luca Bonisi, and he will

00:30.840 --> 00:36.680
talk about one topic when I first saw what he was accomplishing there as one person.

00:36.680 --> 00:43.000
It was amazing. So, and the rest he will talk about, but yeah, it's amazing what one person

00:43.000 --> 00:54.480
was able to do there. Hello. Welcome to Fosman, and welcome to this talk. This talk is about

00:54.480 --> 01:08.440
the right to install any software on your device, on your device, and consequently, what in my

01:08.440 --> 01:22.520
opinion is an unlawful behavior to install, to pre-install software on PC that you normally

01:22.520 --> 01:36.560
install both in your device. Specifically, this software, proprietary software, that are Windows

01:36.560 --> 01:55.520
and Office. I briefly introduced myself. Okay, the images. Sorry. Because the images are missing.

02:06.560 --> 02:22.520
Okay, maybe we can do full screen. Sorry.

02:22.520 --> 02:51.520
Okay. And yes, display, display, how to make a single display.

02:51.520 --> 03:16.880
Okay. Very good. Okay. I introduced myself. My name is Luca Bonisi. I came from Italy.

03:16.880 --> 03:27.400
I am, my main job is developing firmware of electronic devices. And I also support some

03:27.400 --> 03:36.240
school and small office with free software, especially one school that I defined a free

03:36.240 --> 03:45.000
software school where all teachers and students are using free software. I have some hobbies

03:45.000 --> 03:54.640
that are always related to free software. I do video, I am, I am, I do video technicians

03:54.640 --> 04:06.880
where I use a board, Jack, Jamil, Sinaldana, Cappadena live. I play guitar and piano. And

04:06.880 --> 04:18.760
I use Rose Garden as a media player to record from piano. I like to observe celestial objects

04:18.760 --> 04:31.040
like the ISS. This image is the ISS, photographed by me with a normal camera. And I built a

04:31.040 --> 04:48.400
3D printer and I use them mainly for repairing or so forth. I make some free software project

04:48.400 --> 04:58.560
or activity. One is to make a chart on the text of songs since I play piano and guitar

04:58.560 --> 05:06.800
and transpose it automatically. Another is I'm the maintainer of the unofficial porting

05:06.800 --> 05:19.000
of Slackware and Linux distribution for many platform and CPUs. A project that I just started

05:19.000 --> 05:30.320
is to free your Android TV box. I bought cheap Android TV box and I installed Linux to be

05:30.320 --> 05:41.520
used as a general purpose devices. And I am a volunteer of NFSV as a translator. For

05:41.520 --> 05:52.600
NFSV, I built this project that was built in Perl, a language that may be not so used

05:52.600 --> 06:05.400
but I love it. And I built this program to help translate NFSV, to help translation in

06:05.400 --> 06:14.600
the NFSV, the translation process so the translator has not to care about the HTML formatting

06:14.600 --> 06:31.000
and so on. I contribute also at this fantastic book. I mean I maintain the repository of

06:31.000 --> 06:38.360
this free software book. Free software means that this book is distributed with a free

06:38.360 --> 06:53.680
license. And it was translated in five languages actually. German, Ukrainian, Italian, Arabic

06:53.680 --> 07:03.360
and English. The Italian book is not yet published but we wish it will be soon published. And

07:03.360 --> 07:13.040
if you like this book, you can attend the reading of the book this evening at 6 p.m.

07:13.040 --> 07:25.840
and Matias will be the reader, I think. Bonus hobby, I make ice creams. Since the book

07:25.840 --> 07:35.880
talks also about ice cream, it is very related to my hobby. And if you are curious, we will

07:35.880 --> 07:45.880
go to Ubitur this evening. In this presentation, you will find many illustrations like the one

07:45.880 --> 07:53.480
on the right that come from the book. So I sponsor a little bit the book. Okay, we start

07:53.480 --> 08:12.600
with the presentation. We have two different contracts. One is for the hardware and one

08:12.600 --> 08:21.000
is for the software. This contract cannot be joined together. You cannot force to join

08:21.000 --> 08:37.400
the two contracts and to force to give back also the hardware if you ask for the refund.

08:37.400 --> 08:50.440
Because the hardware contract is a sales and purchase agreement. And you become the ownership

08:50.440 --> 08:59.080
of the product or your PC of the product. And nobody can force you to do what you don't

08:59.080 --> 09:10.720
want to do. Instead, the software is a license agreement. You have a right to use the software

09:10.720 --> 09:20.880
under some conditions that for proprietary software, like Windows and Office, are limitations.

09:20.880 --> 09:36.640
Instead, for free software, are freedoms. I talk about device neutrality because you

09:36.640 --> 09:52.320
have the right to choose to install what software you like. Also by installing free software

09:52.320 --> 10:00.120
on your device, you gain the sovereign of your device. Properties software, you don't

10:00.120 --> 10:10.640
know what proprietary software make on your device. What proprietary software connect to

10:10.640 --> 10:23.680
some site that you don't know. Using running free software can overcome software obsolescence.

10:23.680 --> 10:31.920
Because especially with the new version of proprietary software, you are forced to change

10:31.920 --> 10:38.960
your hardware because the new version of proprietary software doesn't run on all the hardware.

10:38.960 --> 10:48.360
Instead, for free software, you can customize like I do with the two boxes and run also

10:48.360 --> 10:57.680
on lower-end devices. And in this way, you extend the hardware lifetime and also you

10:57.680 --> 11:08.720
reduce the electronic impact of the worst. There is also an open letter that the Free

11:08.720 --> 11:22.480
Software Foundation Europe asked to sign for the right to install any software on a device.

11:22.480 --> 11:30.480
The link is this one. Maybe we have a label later. And Free Software Foundation Europe

11:30.480 --> 11:43.240
asked to the European Parliament and Commission and also to public administration to be able

11:43.240 --> 12:02.080
that every device should be independent from the software it runs because using open standards

12:02.080 --> 12:10.960
and open interfaces. This is related to our work because sometimes hardware manufacturers

12:10.960 --> 12:22.480
use this proprietary interface that limits the possibility to use some feature of your

12:22.480 --> 12:36.920
device. Okay, we come first of all technical address. Manufacturers say this is real what

12:36.920 --> 12:45.800
Microsoft says from a device I purchase for the laptop surface I purchase. Microsoft says

12:45.800 --> 12:53.400
that the device would not work properly with other operating systems and they are not supported.

12:53.400 --> 13:06.400
This is said by Microsoft. And this is true because my laptop surface, the touch screen

13:06.400 --> 13:14.120
doesn't work. The webcam doesn't work with new links due to the proprietary interface

13:14.120 --> 13:22.720
of this device. Also, installing the front-stretched new links is not straightforward because

13:22.720 --> 13:31.880
the keyboard and the touchpad doesn't work if you don't build the customizes kernel.

13:31.880 --> 13:40.520
Also, the drivers for the keyboard and the touchpad are not in the main line. But okay,

13:40.520 --> 13:56.680
you can compile and then it works. And the manufacturer could also lock the boot loader.

13:56.680 --> 14:04.440
For example, Microsoft with ARM devices and Windows 8 lock the secure boot in a way that

14:04.440 --> 14:12.440
you cannot install software different than Microsoft Windows. So the device is not really

14:12.440 --> 14:23.280
your because you can only run software certified by another party.

14:23.280 --> 14:33.960
When we come to legal level, manufacturers often say that even if the license say that

14:33.960 --> 14:42.800
you must contact the manufacturers, the manufacturer says that you have to ask the review to the

14:42.800 --> 14:50.000
vendor or to Microsoft. But this is not true because the license agreement says that you

14:50.000 --> 15:02.680
have to contact the manufacturer. Manufacturer says that you must also return the PC. So you

15:02.680 --> 15:12.920
should have all the refund of all PC, both PC and the software. In fact, you can't have

15:12.920 --> 15:22.080
only the software refund. Manufacturer set a very little time span to ask for the refund,

15:22.080 --> 15:33.360
usually only 30 days. Manufacturer says that you must prove you refuse the license. But

15:33.360 --> 15:40.160
it is impossible to prove you refuse the license because when you start the first time Windows,

15:40.160 --> 15:51.000
you have only one button, accept. You cannot even power down the PC. Especially if it is

15:51.000 --> 15:57.120
a laptop, it could be a problem because the battery is integrated, usually integrated,

15:57.120 --> 16:02.840
and you cannot show power off the PC if you don't know that you have to press the power

16:02.840 --> 16:15.360
button for that same cost. Recently, a factory has switched their policy and said that you

16:15.360 --> 16:24.520
must return the PC to their laboratory because you must remove the product that is the information

16:24.520 --> 16:38.440
about the Windows license stored in the BIOS. Manufacturers set a price by your own, not

16:38.440 --> 16:51.880
the market price of the Windows license. When you first run the PC to see the license

16:51.880 --> 17:00.480
agreement, because to refuse the license agreement, you have to see the license agreement. With

17:00.480 --> 17:07.920
the latest Windows session, it is mandatory to connect your PC to the Internet before

17:07.920 --> 17:19.080
viewing the license agreement. I think this could be not compliant to the GDPR because

17:19.080 --> 17:29.760
your PC sends information to manufacturers and to Microsoft sites without your explicit

17:29.760 --> 17:37.800
agreement. There is no refuse button as I already said, and you cannot install a different

17:37.800 --> 17:50.320
license if you remove Windows and you download the Microsoft Windows from Microsoft website

17:50.320 --> 17:55.920
and you want to install a full license or also the gratis license because Windows is

17:55.920 --> 18:02.000
gratis. This is only a limitation that you cannot customize the toolbar. You cannot do

18:02.000 --> 18:08.600
it because when you install the version you downloaded from the Internet, it looks for

18:08.600 --> 18:18.720
the product key. So you are in your search circuits. Okay, very briefly cases of refuelling

18:18.720 --> 18:33.000
in Italy. There was a case in 2005 against HP. The case came to the Supreme Court of

18:33.000 --> 18:51.400
Italy and that said the refund must be given. It's about nine years, it's last to all the

18:51.400 --> 19:08.520
SQL. The second case is similar. It takes also nine years. It's very similar. And this

19:08.520 --> 19:29.520
case is regarding this PC. And I repressed the refund in 2018. Lenovo refused categorically

19:29.520 --> 19:39.400
the refund on the software. They asked that they say that I have to return also the PC.

19:39.400 --> 19:50.240
But I filed a court case by myself without a lawyer initially because from my side it

19:50.240 --> 20:06.720
was clear that Lenovo has won. But Lenovo introduced artificial complexity so that I

20:06.720 --> 20:14.240
cannot continue without a lawyer. So I asked for a lawyer. I win the first grade low seat

20:14.240 --> 20:22.120
but Lenovo immediately filed the second grade, the appeal, the second grade low seat. And

20:22.120 --> 20:36.400
they lost the second grade but the judge of Monza Kurt imposed to Lenovo a punitive damages

20:36.400 --> 20:52.160
of 20,000 euros because they use the legal instruments with bad fate without any valid

20:52.160 --> 21:09.280
reason. Okay, after these cases, I requested also other reasons refund. The case was simpler

21:09.280 --> 21:19.480
but not so easy. Asher, for example, asked to return the PC to remove the product K.

21:19.480 --> 21:30.840
And in this case, since I have some excessive front end, I go with the bike to bring my

21:30.840 --> 21:43.640
PC to Asher. There are also other cases, one with Microsoft as I already said. One with

21:43.640 --> 21:59.080
HP. I filed a court case against HP. They lost the court case. But this case, the judge

21:59.080 --> 22:09.640
does not recognize to me the legal fee. So the balance was the same. I lost what I gained

22:09.640 --> 22:25.280
from the refund. Other cases, okay. This is very interesting the last year with Asher

22:25.280 --> 22:32.640
because when I asked to Asher, this time I need the PC immediately so I cannot wait to

22:32.640 --> 22:44.360
send the PC to Asher and to give it back. And Asher said that it was Microsoft that asked

22:44.360 --> 22:55.320
to send the PC to the manufacturer to remove the product K. Then I filed a court case but

22:55.320 --> 23:12.320
it was stopped by Asher before reaching the first year. So they gave me 129 euros. Latest

23:12.320 --> 23:23.320
case against Lenovo that was terminated three days ago. Lenovo says again that you must

23:23.320 --> 23:33.880
return the PC to the manufacturer and they say that they are not satisfied by the license.

23:33.880 --> 23:40.320
The license they propose, they are not satisfied by the license, they themselves propose. So

23:40.320 --> 23:55.320
it is not very coherent. Okay. Asking for the phone, I go very quickly. You have to power

23:55.320 --> 24:02.320
on the PC, you have to read the license, contact the manufacturer, send email and certified

24:02.320 --> 24:14.320
mail in Italy. And you have to be very patient because many mails you have to send before

24:14.320 --> 24:25.320
requesting the refund, before having the refund. But you will have the refund. Okay. One important

24:25.320 --> 24:36.320
thing is that manufacturers artificially increase the cost of the PC with the mandatory payment

24:36.320 --> 24:48.320
to Microsoft. I think that if you obtain the refund, you have to give part of the refund

24:48.320 --> 24:58.320
to some free software organization. I give all 20,000 euros to this association. And

24:58.320 --> 25:12.320
if you want to donate, you can go to the link down. And if you can support the free software

25:12.320 --> 25:19.320
they value the work. Thank you.

25:19.320 --> 25:42.320
Hello. Is this working now? I think the main problem with this mic is the pickup on it is

25:42.320 --> 25:49.320
substantially lower than the pickup on that.
