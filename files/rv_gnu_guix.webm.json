{"text": " Okay, so, hello everybody. I am a frying flasherner. I work on porting risk five to GNU Geeks or GNU Geeks to risk five, depending on which way you look at things. I've been involved with Geeks as a packager and involved with Geeks in general since about 2015. Yes, over the years I've just ended up touching everything in the code base just by accident to just end up happening. I also worked, I guess the first big project was porting Geeks to AR64, which was similar but different with a lot of pieces. So this slide I meant to fill in a bit, but not very good with drawing on the computer. So some quick stuff about Geeks. It is a, at the heart of it, it's a transactional package manager. So that means that anything that you do, you can undo and roll back. And so that gives you the chance to, I guess in terms of porting things, you get to build things and see how they break and then build it again and see how else it breaks. And in the end, when it works, you don't have to worry about all the broken stuff polluting your environment. So using just the pieces that work every single time and just the pieces you're actually putting in every single time. Everything is built in a container, again, back to the, everything is self-enclosed when you're building it. And everything is built natively. We do, I mean, there is support for cross-building just about everything, but when we're actually installing programs, everything is actually built on native hardware. This picture is a little small and actually a little old. Let me slide this down a little bit. This one is from the actual bootstrap of, I don't know, it's little dated, it's changed a little bit. You start from an actual couple's statically compiled binaries and in this case, it's actually down, we download, yeah, we actually download in this picture the GCC 4.7 source code and compile it to the GCC bootstrap. So it's, so everything is a, so DAG is a directed acyclic graph. Everything, you can follow the inputs from one package to the next and see exactly how everything is built. So going back to the first talk, which I suggest everyone watches if I really enjoyed it. Our self-hosting comes from a couple of cross-compiled static binaries from another architecture running Geeks, which then we use to bootstrap everything up from the start on direction. So the same G-Lib C bootstrap here and GCC bootstrap here, then for whatever reason, we've actually flipped the graph around going the other way and now we're going from bottom to top. So G-Lib C bootstrap at the bottom and aiming up. So go and actually bootstrap everything, the, I actually haven't used Gen 2, but from what I understand the stage one and stage two starts, you start from just about nothing and it just builds itself also the way Linux from scratch does until you actually reach a fully functional and optimal as much as you want the optimizing fully functional and optimized or built with dash O2 binaries that you actually use to build everything else in the system. So just coming at it from the distribution side, risk five, okay, so what's it similar to? What sorts of problems did I run into with the actual porting? Yes, let's see, so the AR64 port, the boards at least initially were a little easier to get. ARM already had partners building boards and could get somewhat expensive ARM V8 boards in different places. Risk five boards that I've picked up actually mostly been through Kickstarter and one way that's one way that I guess I found it's radically different than ARM is that anyone can put together a chip and create it and sell it and there are just so many more options available for the actual chips and for the actual boards. On one hand, looking at online discussion, sometimes it seems like risk five will save the world and it's a unicorn farting out rainbows and it's just the end all be all. From the pure packaging side, it's another architecture that not a lot of people are using yet, but it really is somewhere in the middle as all things seem to be. My impression so far is that it's gotten much faster adoption than AR64. I bought my first AR64 board in 2017, I think. It was ARM V8 or the 8.0 specifically. Go ahead and buy an ARM 8 board today. It's still the 8.0 architecture other than Mac, the M1s which are almost 8.5. ARM just finalized the ARM V9 architecture and everyone's still selling ARM 8 boards. So it's really is exploding everywhere and as a project Geeks aims to make it available for as another architecture that Geeks runs on. So I guess other comparisons that I've run into, a lot of software doesn't have any sort of just-in-time compilation and a lot of it seems to be hand-coded assembly or added after the fact and a lot of times when building software end up with something just saying risk five isn't supported for just-in-time, your architecture is not supported past the no JIT flag. So PowerPC64, one hand in the past, I guess you still have the Apple G5s which were big Indian PowerPC64 and now we've switched to little Indian and you end up in a similar situation of there just aren't, no one's written that for yet, they come across a whole bunch of packages where you don't use autoconf and configure make install to install the packages and things just end up being too old, I apologize this one's a little small again, you go and run configure and have a timestamp, it was last updated in 2014, it was the last time they grabbed the let's say stock file, it's a regularly used file for plenty of packages and this just says yes I recognize that your names comes back as riskv64, I don't know what to do with that. So as part of the packaging of everything we do go through and have to update these packages. So in terms of I guess this is where I'm starting from with some of this, there's been a lot of work by the other distributions by many people to actually get risk five support into all of the tool chains and into major programming languages and really make it to the point where it's just go and create some bootstrap binaries and things just start building and so we've been very lucky that it's been such a big effort and everyone's so excited for it that built the bootstrap binaries and everything more or less just started working. So we really didn't have any, I mean other than you know we weren't using these versions these ones were a little too old but you know as things built up things pretty much just kept on going and working correctly. So one thing, so I mentioned that in Geeks everything is built containerized when it's installed it's not installed into FHS into the file hierarchy system, file system hierarchy. It's not installed in, we don't use the regular prefixes so here we don't have a user lib, we don't have a slash lib as part of a, I assume as part of a multi-lib change which happened years ago in most Linux distros, a lot of packages end up getting installed and we'll say user lib and then we'll say what architecture and what ABI it is and then we'll fall back to oh and otherwise it's just here in slash lib or slash user lib. All of our packages get installed into its own hashed prefix so for example this one is from GCC. So instead of looking in user lib, GCC I forget the actual path but anyway so we're not going to find libgcc.so used for linking everything pretty much actually had to comment out the start file prefix spec so that GCC would correctly link to itself after it had been built. So it was a odd situation that most things built and then occasionally things would just fail and say I can't find libgcc and say just built everything else where is it and then I add the library specifically and suddenly it could find it and eventually it turned out that as part of taking everything from its own special prefix, putting it together in the build environment and building, when I added libgcc specifically it got added into the library path and everything found it and without it it's supposed to be brought in by GCC itself, by the binary and then say oh yeah and here's libgcc if you need it so this was kind of a little gotcha that got me for a couple of months and I actually started adding ugly hacks around the Geeks code base to say and when you're building on risk five add in libgcc here and add it in over there and I had ended up with a paragraph size note going back to the after bootstrapping everything and getting to the final GCC used to build everything we actually had a special one just for risk five that said in addition to everything that's normally there we also need libgcc so I mean this was a looking back at it you know it feels silly adding everything but some of it also is I guess live and learn and you know get things to work. I found upstream and this one is you know it's a little dark maybe a little hard to read upstream is mostly been it's been happy to you know accept patches for risk five support some of the patches that that I've added to make things work you've just grabbed from upstream from newer versions or from pull requests or modified from other ones and said you know it worked here it'll work here too or this is about the same so as part of bootstrapping everything from source and we we support Rust as we aim to support pretty much every programming language and so current installation instructions for Rust are download Rust and use Rust up to manage Rust and in the distributions it's you know at some point it's in and then you use one version to build the next and then as far as actually putting Rust in the first time you know coming from source only our options really were to you know follow the OCaml path back from the very big very early days and build a thousand copies of it until we got to something more modern. Luckily for us there was an effort called M Rust C which aims to implement enough of the Rust C binary itself to rebuild Rust C and the rest in this case the rest of Rust 1.54 so and this was the you know the pull request that I had for hey and it also works on risk five we said oh everything just worked so we said yeah you know after you know split up the build instructions and built everything and everything just went and after 56 hours I had Rust 1.54 so it was on on my x86 machine it took you know four or five hours maybe here it took 56 hours and it's you know the machines are they're getting faster and it was you know luckily I didn't you know there was no hand compiling there was no interacting with it in the middle it's and Geeks made it sit easy to just say here's the build instructions take the pieces and go so said here's the build instructions and I was always curious so I added time before everything and said 56 hours later here you go it just works so yeah so this is let me skip that one so I mean inside of Geeks you know was you know add the patch and then you know just tag supported systems saying you know yes it also works on risk five and you know here you're going back to the previous slides about you know end up with similarities with AR64 and with PowerPC that certain things just aren't you know aren't fully tested or aren't fully supported you know I ended up making the same mistake here and we've changed I changed it from you know it only works on these architectures to you know it's it works and it's it does it's you know it's not expected to be super efficient or fast but it gets the job done and I left the it may support I686 soon and I completely left out PowerPC no mention that you know it's coming or it's in progress or it probably works or even it just works on all 64 bit machines that we have it's completely forgotten so it's you know I fall into the same traps too sometimes with those as far as other language support for Go for most languages well for Go for most architectures we start with the Go 1.4 release from Google and then use that to build newer versions it's an issue with GCC Go with I forget the interaction it got fixed later so we're using GCC Go 10 to build Go 1.16 to build newer Go versions I've done it on X8664 which for this type of thing is where I normally end up doing most of the testing not to say cross-compiler but just to say use Go use GCC Go for X8664 to build Go 1.16 to build newer Go's and just say you know does this process work then say okay well let's you know do it on the on actual risk five and there was there's some issue with the test suite that I need to fix up the actual building process of building of the building before the testing takes I mean that part takes 12 to 20 hours it's I'm not sure why that part takes so long it's just one of those things I mean for node this one we fell into some we fell back into our bootstrapping trap of some sort of circular dependency between LLHTP and node itself in later versions so this one I'm actively working on I think node officially got support for risk five and 16 or 18 partway through the cycle so I have to back port it to 14 which we currently have packaged and then again to 10 so that we can move forward with it Java Java's a problem I'm not sure we're actually ever going to get Java support it's one of those things it's going to take a really long time someone can correct me I believe Java support officially upstream it was added in Java 18 we build Java using the previous version going back version by version initially we had used until through GCC five there was a Java compiler as part of GCC after which it got removed and we used that for a while but it turned out that Java compiler also needed a Java compiler to compile itself so after some software archaeology luckily not by me someone else worked on this one managed to package early versions of of new class path from I'm going to say the year 2000 or so and use that to build uh iced tea the you know then free version of Java with Java 7 of Java 1.6 1.7 1.8 and use that to build all the open JDKs and so to backport risk five support all the way back through everything and we actually have a hard enough time keeping AR64 working on some of the earlier versions I'm I'm hesitant to touch that one Haskell is actually one of the ones where we've we've looked at it and it comes up every six to eight months like can can we do better on this one so I mean I've spent a fair amount of time looking at the Haskell download page binaries going back years and years they have 0.29 listed as an option for downloading every version of Haskell needs an earlier every version of GHC needs an earlier version of GHC all the way back to the beginning there are alternate implementations back in the early days which can't actually get to build GHC itself so for for other architectures we actually do just say okay we'll take the you know we've chosen a point grab the official binary released by GHC and use that to build all future versions there's you know there's nothing for risk five currently from from upstream Haskell we we could add support currently our Haskell build system doesn't actually support crossbuilding it's more of it hasn't come up no one's done it yet so I mean we could cross build from x86 64 to risk five for that but then you're left with if you want to build anything using Haskell you need a second computer to build it and so looked into briefly can we cross build the other way from foreign to native and I mean other than an interesting thought experiment of now you have to build an entire second architecture to build the one you're actually using we actually we haven't made any progress on that one and seemed like it was more of an interesting thought experiment than something that we actually thought we would end up going forward on so I guess going back to you know actually talking about risk five itself one of the another thing that geeks has is like all links distributions we target a base architecture which is great for distributing binaries it's not great for actually running optimized binaries so you have a flag called dash dash tune obviously for for hello which just prints hello world it's not useful but for plenty of other programs it is so so when starting the risk five port I followed the it's the process that Debian and Fedor and I assume others took and I targeted the gc extension combination so as as time goes on and we get more extensions we'll be able to use the tune flag to say you know yes I'm you know I'm happy using the baseline or that's what I have or actually I have these other extensions you know rebuild some of the software so that I can actually make use of the better hardware of the more advanced hardware that I have with the extra extensions and in that way you know we've we've had good use of the tune flag in high performance computing in people with newer machines and be targeted by x86 64 v4 as a sub architecture you know we're we're still going through and and trying to find programs that are good for tagging saying you know yes this will actually run faster enough to be worth it but certain certainly plenty of math applications do very well with that and so I'm I'm you know everything's in place to add more sub architecture support for risk five as it comes you know we just have to you know actually have access to it and you know hopefully test it before just saying yeah yeah it'll it'll work fine so it'll probably just work fine but you know so it's it's it's there and you know it's you know it works fairly well for you know for everyone that's that's actually using it um see I was wondering you know if any any questions any comments seem to have an extended q and a period here at the end of my talk I'm happy to talk more about how geeks interacts with you know with you know other architectures with anything how you know other fun stories with courting software to work on risk five yes okay so the question was risk risk gcc is gaining the rust front end and have I looked into it for the bootstrapping part I haven't looked into it yet for the bootstrapping part my understanding is that it is that it you're similar to I'm rustsy it implements the it just aims to implement the I guess the rustsy binary more or less itself also so that so currently and so currently when we're building rust programs we'll say okay well upstream says cargo build this we run cargo build this and then cargo itself says you know rustsy library and this part is here and that part is there and that part is there and we can do the same thing um with you know either you know just with rustsy itself or with the rust front end from gcc it should also be possible which uh you know I'm not sure for uh bootstrapping rust if we would if it's something that we would slot in it's you know I guess at first thought I could see slotting it in uh instead of m rustsy itself and just saying we'll take the m rustsy infrastructure to go and say you know here's the pieces we need to build to rebuild rustsy from upstream but we're going to use gcc's rust to actually build everything faster and more efficiently which would also solve some of the other architecture problems and you know as rust gets into the linux kernel we're definitely planning on using the gcc rust front end for that uh yes okay so the question was has there been progress on building desktop environments and not just languages um let's see so I have built let's see current no I'm thinking through all the all the source code bits I personally run enlightenment on my laptop uh that one doesn't work yet but that's because we use an older version of uh lua jet as an input and I just need to actually tell it no for risk five use lua itself instead of lua jet or no really I'm not giving it to you and don't look for it and don't error if it's not there um other than that enlightenment should work which I know has many people using it as far as uh major desktops um it's the xfce just builds fine uh mate or mate just builds fine uh gnome I'm sorry I said that again yeah running it is another thing um I have not actually tested running it on the hardware itself yet um I've been uh I guess so far focused on the actual uh I guess just getting everything to build first uh as far as actually running geeks on the heart on I guess uh so geeks runs uh in two ways it runs as the entire operating system or on top of a foreign operating system so so far I've been running geeks on top of whatever uh operating whatever Linux happens to come from the vendor and I've been you know using that as the base um as part of actually testing the uh it should be not too hard to test it with qmu either from risk five or from an x86 64 machine running uh using the risk using the qmu emulation uh as far as actually building a actual image for one of the boards um I ran into some issues with uh different boards needing specific offsets for um it was just the g-parted version of fdesk helps create some partitions in a scriptable way and uh assigning magic partition codes and things like that so it's very doable in geeks uh this one was actually uh a problem problem I ran into I I actually burned through all of my spare sd cards so I was building everything on the risk five boards and then I needed a new one to go and say now actually you know create an installable image and install to that sd card and I I had actually run out of them uh but I've actually I've picked up more finally and um at the point now where I can go and say uh so the first plan was to go and say here's the here's an upstream image either from a vendor or from another uh Linux distribution I'm going to flash that onto the sd card that gets me all the partitions that I need then I say uh geeks system in it into the sd card that's already partitioned correctly and it'll install u-boot over uh over the u-boot and the os over the entire root partition and then you know it should either work or not and if it doesn't then we're into the you know why not but assuming everything just works uh everything should just come up in work and I'll be able to better test the graphical applications okay let's see so currently I am using what was it I'm using the sci-fi unmatched board uh when you know after a year long wait or so it was a long lead time with mouser it it did finally arrive and uh shocked the local computer guy when I showed up and said I need a case and a cpu and I have this he's like oh do you what else do you need it's like graphics card peripherals like nope have risk five board and he's like you're you're you're you're killing me again so he's the one I've gone to in the past when it's been okay I need a graphics card and it has to be 10 years old and work with you know Linux library kernel and it's you know sometimes it just becomes a you know work with the pieces that I have so that's that's the main machine that I've been doing a lot of the work on um the so I've also have the uh first vision five board uh that's been helping a lot with a lot of the building and I recently got the vision five two which so far seems to be at least as powerful as the high five unmatched uh not the one with the eight gigs of ram uh compared to the 16 from the high five unmatched and the cpu uh up to 1.5 gigahertz instead of 1.2 ish and you know truly in the we had some geeks meetup days before FOSDM actually hooked up to the projector and just started building you know building from nothing up to uh hello and you know things were building and it was people say oh what are we building now you know where are we up to now so it was you know GCC itself takes six to eight hours to build uh from from the uh bare bootstrap binaries uh from this one here from the bare bootstrap binaries up to hello which you know is the first quick to build package uh after building everything you you know GCC and Ben utils and everything you actually build everything with on risk five uh it was uh somewhere between 16 and 20 hours of building uh on on x86 64 the entire process I think was four to six hours maybe a little faster um it's taken a little longer now that now that the bootstrap bit has has been extended um it's yeah the one of the other architectures that I worked on for fun was 32 bit power pc and so that one that one was really more of a because I had it and not because anyone uses it and so with that one uh GCC 10 actually takes more than 24 hours to build so it's so you know it's it's actually useful hardware unlike the 32 bit power pc may I ask what is the answer is there is some cross compilation for duix uh I'm familiar with the next so I would expect that the initial would be to use cross compilation and not the native but duix doesn't have a cross compilation only it's just the direction to write the native because of course that would be way faster yeah it would be way faster um so the question was uh so you are familiar with nix which does have cross compilation and you're wondering if geeks also had cross compilation which would be much faster to compile than native uh so geeks does have cross compilation uh you can cross compile binaries and then um use the basically geeks send command to send it to the board and then run it there and everything just works uh as far as actually building from it though uh everything gets built from the native binaries so the initial bootstrap binaries uh cross compiled and uh they were then used to as the native binaries to go and build everything else uh but you know I've used cross compiling uh one the where was it uh for for node that one back porting basically you know two rounds uh the plan for back porting node was to back port it to node 14 and then cross compile from x86 to risk five and say does node 14 work with this patch that I've written and then once it does then to go and back port it the rest of the way to node 10 and then to go and you know haven't decided there whether whether the actual building would be faster to uh cross build node 10 as a test or whether to start from native as the test so um so geeks does do uh yeah we do have cross compilation and we do use it for you know for creating images or creating binaries for for other architectures but as far as actually uh building from it or using it as a as a stepping stone it's really only in the very initial stage when the architecture is first added okay so I I think that's it so thank you everyone", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.68, "text": " Okay, so, hello everybody.",
