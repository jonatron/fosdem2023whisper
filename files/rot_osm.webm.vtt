00:00.000 --> 00:10.440
Thank you for coming to my talk, I'm very glad that the room is so packed, so I hope

00:10.440 --> 00:13.360
that this will be of interest to you.

00:13.360 --> 00:19.360
So my talk is named OpenStreetMap, one geographic database to rule them all, mapping the railway

00:19.360 --> 00:22.320
network for the public with the public.

00:22.320 --> 00:29.920
And I will focus on OpenStreetMap and open data related topics for OSRD, which is an

00:29.920 --> 00:36.560
open source project developed by SNSF, the French Railway Company, which is part of

00:36.560 --> 00:38.080
the Open Rail Foundation.

00:38.080 --> 00:45.800
So there are many information about this here on the panel.

00:45.800 --> 00:51.640
Just a few reminders about why the railway company should invest in open data.

00:51.640 --> 00:58.880
I think you are all convinced that open data is the way to go for all of projects.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.800
But inside the railway companies, it's not always that obvious.

01:03.800 --> 01:09.920
So we want long distance trains across Europe, so we can construct together the transport

01:09.920 --> 01:12.600
network of the future on rails.

01:12.600 --> 01:19.080
We want to do European cooperation because we have railway infrastructure managers in

01:19.080 --> 01:25.160
all European countries that have the same needs, and yet we are still paying for different

01:25.160 --> 01:29.600
software providers for the same tools and the same data.

01:29.600 --> 01:36.320
And of course, we want free competition to prove that all of the train operators we work

01:36.320 --> 01:38.040
with are treated the same.

01:38.040 --> 01:45.000
So if we share the same source code and the same data, we can ensure that.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.560
I will dive into the specific need of OSRD, which is our project.

01:50.560 --> 01:55.960
Of course, you may have different data needs, so I will focus on these.

01:55.960 --> 02:01.360
If any in the room have other experience with other types of data, I will be very happy

02:01.360 --> 02:03.920
to discuss with you.

02:03.920 --> 02:11.440
So in OSRD, we have four main features, pass-finding or route compatibility check is to find a

02:11.440 --> 02:15.560
train pass in the European railway network.

02:15.560 --> 02:21.320
And in time calculation is to calculate the time that the train will take to go from point

02:21.320 --> 02:28.000
A to point B, conflict detection is to ensure that the train will not run into another train

02:28.000 --> 02:34.640
during its route, and short-term train planning is to add a new train into the timetable at

02:34.640 --> 02:36.160
the last minute.

02:36.160 --> 02:41.720
Maybe you were lucky to hear my colleague Elwa this morning talk about this topic.

02:41.720 --> 02:47.080
So to do these four features, we need a lot of data, tracks, geometry and topology at

02:47.080 --> 02:55.680
track level and not line level signals, switches, routes and detectors, which are kind of technical

02:55.680 --> 03:04.560
objects, electrification of the tracks, loading gauge, speed limits, slopes, curves, real-time

03:04.560 --> 03:11.160
position of trains, and stations can be useful for display use.

03:11.160 --> 03:16.080
So I've detailed the needs for each of the features, but what you can remind is that

03:16.080 --> 03:22.480
we need a lot of data, which is all geographic and in high quality.

03:22.480 --> 03:28.120
So the goal of this study and what I will show you today is we want to find and compare

03:28.120 --> 03:34.480
European level open data to choose the best source for our needs at OSRD, but also maybe

03:34.480 --> 03:40.600
for your needs if you're working with the same data needs in your projects.

03:40.600 --> 03:47.360
I've compared four data sources, the RIMF or Registrar of Infrastructure is a data source

03:47.360 --> 03:52.240
provided by the Agency for Railways of the European Union.

03:52.240 --> 04:00.520
Inspire is a European directive that's ensure to share geographic data across Europe.

04:00.520 --> 04:06.880
Then we can find open data platforms of infrastructure managers, but there are one data platform for

04:06.880 --> 04:13.240
each company, so it can be quite confusing to find the good data and of course they all

04:13.240 --> 04:15.440
use different formats.

04:15.440 --> 04:29.040
And finally, OpenStreetMap, which is as you all know, I hope, collaborative database of

04:29.040 --> 04:32.600
geographic feed data, and it feeds all of our needs.

04:32.600 --> 04:37.680
We want open data, we want a data model which is consistent across Europe so that we don't

04:37.680 --> 04:41.480
have to change the parameter of our tool in each country.

04:41.480 --> 04:46.320
We want a data model that can evolve if we want to add a new feature.

04:46.320 --> 04:55.840
Of course, we need English documentation, easy data access, and a wide data perimeter.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.720
Let's try to access some data.

04:57.720 --> 05:06.160
So here I am on the Inspire website, I can find a broken link in a mixed language.

05:06.160 --> 05:11.520
Another example of Inspire data, which is supposed to have good metadata.

05:11.520 --> 05:18.080
Here you can see the link to access the data, which is in the middle of the page, so very

05:18.080 --> 05:20.320
easy to find.

05:20.320 --> 05:27.080
And finally, another example, I could go on and on about this, but this is a page in,

05:27.080 --> 05:33.480
I think, Swedish, but it cannot be translated nor copy and paste in any translator.

05:33.480 --> 05:37.640
So you have to click and download the data, hoping for the best.

05:37.640 --> 05:42.920
This is not to blame the people that have created these pages, but just to share that

05:42.920 --> 05:49.920
finding open data can be very time consuming and very difficult, especially if you, as

05:49.920 --> 05:55.280
me, don't talk all the European languages.

05:55.280 --> 05:59.440
Then once you have downloaded the data, we can try to assess data quality.

05:59.440 --> 06:04.400
For example, this is the railway network in Italy that I've downloaded from the Inspire

06:04.400 --> 06:05.400
dataset.

06:05.400 --> 06:12.360
And as you can see, there's supposedly a railway tunnel that links Tivita Vecchia and

06:12.360 --> 06:13.600
Sardinia.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.800
So I was very surprised by that.

06:17.800 --> 06:23.560
I checked on the official RFI website, which is the Infrastructure Manager for Italy.

06:23.560 --> 06:28.560
And in the official website, we cannot find this underwater tunnel.

06:28.560 --> 06:37.040
So of course, I was not allowed to travel across all Europe to check all the data quality

06:37.040 --> 06:41.320
that I've downloaded, so, yes?

06:41.320 --> 06:51.640
In some place, it is true, but there it is not.

06:51.640 --> 06:58.720
So first question we want to ask is for all the open data sources that I've found, are

06:58.720 --> 07:02.320
they compatible with OpenStreetsMap?

07:02.320 --> 07:08.520
In many cases, this is the case, but unfortunately, for the Creative Commons license, we must

07:08.520 --> 07:14.160
ask the provider if the attribution in OpenStreetsMap is good enough.

07:14.160 --> 07:23.440
So this can take more time, and it's not as easy as other type of licenses.

07:23.440 --> 07:28.400
So if you publish open data, it's important to check if the license is compatible with

07:28.400 --> 07:30.440
OSM.

07:30.440 --> 07:34.600
And as you can see, unfortunately, there are still many European countries where I have

07:34.600 --> 07:37.600
found no open data source at all.

07:37.600 --> 07:43.080
So maybe it's because I don't speak the language, but still, it's problematic.

07:43.080 --> 07:47.240
Then I've done a little quantitative comparison of the data I've found.

07:47.240 --> 07:54.640
So this is a comparison of track length total for one country, so by country and by source.

07:54.640 --> 08:00.880
As you can see, I have found data on OpenStreetsMap for all of the European countries, but not

08:00.880 --> 08:06.360
an open data source that is not OSM for all countries.

08:06.360 --> 08:11.280
And even more, what we can see on the graph is that in every country, the OpenStreetsMap

08:11.280 --> 08:18.240
data shows more tracks than the open data data.

08:18.240 --> 08:23.360
So even if there is open data available, it seems that the OpenStreetsMap data is more

08:23.360 --> 08:26.760
complete.

08:26.760 --> 08:37.200
Then I tried to design an indicator to see if all the useful data was available for OSRD

08:37.200 --> 08:38.200
needs.

08:38.200 --> 08:42.120
So you can see the same data needs that I've presented before.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.120
And I have classified them by necessity.

08:45.120 --> 08:52.440
So we require tracks and signals to make OSRD run, and then the other data are optional,

08:52.440 --> 08:57.360
which means if we have them, this is good, and we will have a better result.

08:57.360 --> 09:03.400
But if we don't have them, we can still run our tool and have partial results.

09:03.400 --> 09:12.200
So I've designed an indicator, which is good if we have the two required data and two optional

09:12.200 --> 09:19.840
data or more, then an OK indicator if we have part of the required data.

09:19.840 --> 09:28.400
The required indicator can be one and a half if we have partial data.

09:28.400 --> 09:33.600
It's quite complicated, but I have shared the full methodology on the blog, and I will

09:33.600 --> 09:36.440
send you the link after, so don't worry.

09:36.440 --> 09:42.920
What you have to remember is that this indicator will give you an overview of if the available

09:42.920 --> 09:47.120
data can be used for OSRD needs.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.480
So what are the results of this study?

09:49.480 --> 09:52.920
First, what we can do is open data.

09:52.920 --> 09:57.680
Unfortunately, as you can see, the map is not so green.

09:57.680 --> 10:05.440
So there are a few countries where you can do OK or poor implementation of OSRD using

10:05.440 --> 10:09.840
open data, excluding OpenStreetMap.

10:09.840 --> 10:14.400
And then we can see the map for the OpenStreetMap data.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.400
It's better.

10:15.400 --> 10:19.480
It's not that better, but it's better.

10:19.480 --> 10:27.120
So there are many countries that were read in the first map that are now green, and there

10:27.120 --> 10:31.520
are many countries that were gray that are now red.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.760
So it's not that good, but it's better.

10:34.760 --> 10:40.760
What we can see is that OpenStreetMap is the database we should use and improve because

10:40.760 --> 10:45.280
it's currently the best standard across Europe.

10:45.280 --> 10:51.920
So as I've said, you can look at the full data and methodology on our blog.

10:51.920 --> 10:59.200
So there is the detailed analysis for each country, as well as the sources for each

10:59.200 --> 11:00.920
open data set that I found.

11:00.920 --> 11:08.680
So if you're interested in one country, specifically, you can check out this.

11:08.680 --> 11:14.400
I'd like to thank the people that have done the icons for this presentation, and also

11:14.400 --> 11:20.240
a special thanks for the QGIS community that have allowed me to make the maps and most

11:20.240 --> 11:21.520
of the analysis.

11:21.520 --> 11:27.640
So maybe if there are QGIS developers there, thank you so much for your work.

11:27.640 --> 11:31.320
And finally, if you want to contact us, there are emails.

11:31.320 --> 11:35.160
You can learn more about the OSRD project on our website.

11:35.160 --> 11:39.160
You can chat with us, and if you're a railway company, you might be interested in joining

11:39.160 --> 11:42.960
the Open Rail Foundation, so let us know.

11:42.960 --> 11:43.960
Thank you for listening.

11:43.960 --> 11:52.560
Thank you.
