In this talk, Daniel Stone provides a high-level overview of the graphic stack in free and open source software development. He explains the different components of the modern graphic stack, including the display, window system layer (such as Wayland), and the clients. He also discusses how OpenGL, Vulkan, and EGL fit into the stack, as well as tools and protocols like DMA buff and Profetto. The talk emphasizes the importance of understanding the different components and their interactions in order to work effectively with the graphic stack.
