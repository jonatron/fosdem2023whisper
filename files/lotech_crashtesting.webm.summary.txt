The speaker, Gabor Keremann from Allotopia at BMW, discussed how they perform crash testing in their backyard. The crash testing is a QA subproject of TDF that tests continuously opening files, saving them in different formats, and reopening them to ensure no crashes occur. The speaker discussed the prerequisites for the work, such as a beefy system with many CPUs and tens of thousands of files. They also described the downloading and configuration of the scripts, including a config file, and provided details on how to interpret the results. By making the scripts more configurable, they were able to gain a little bit of performance gain and allow for easier setup for other companies.
