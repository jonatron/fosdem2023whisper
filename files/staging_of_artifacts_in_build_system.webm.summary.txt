Sascha Roloff from Huawei Intelligent Cloud Technology Lab introduced the concept of staging in build systems to improve upon suboptimal practices in current build systems. Staging proposes that actions can freely select the location of input and output artifacts within its working directory, introducing a separation between physical and logical paths inside an action. This allows for the elimination of the need for unique names for each artifact and for staging to be implemented in build systems. Roloff presented their project Just Build utilizing staging with the JSON syntax and content-addressable storage. The project has been recently open-sourced and is currently being worked on by five developers.
