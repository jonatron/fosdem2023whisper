The talk is about FQ, a tool and language for working with data. It is heavily inspired by JQ and is used for querying and displaying data. FQ supports 113 formats, including media, executable, archiving, networking, and serialization formats. The speaker primarily uses FQ for debugging and triaging broken media files. FQ has limitations in encoding and cannot easily change values in JSON structures. The speaker demonstrates FQ's capabilities through a live demo using a pcap file. They show how FQ can extract and manipulate data from various formats, such as mp4 files and XML subtitles. They also mention that FQ can be used as a hex editor. The speaker concludes by mentioning some challenges in adding encoding support to FQ and emphasizes the declarative and simple approach in writing FQ code.
