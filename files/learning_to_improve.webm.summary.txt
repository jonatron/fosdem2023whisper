In this talk, Bradley Kuhn reflects on his 25 years as a free and open-source software activist. He discusses the mistakes and compromises made by the community over the years, such as aligning with for-profit companies and focusing too much on commercial adoption. He also examines the impact of advertising-based funding in the software industry and the failure to address DRM. He calls for a reassessment of the coalition-building efforts and a stronger focus on user autonomy and the needs of hobbyists. He concludes by emphasizing the need for individual actions and the importance of building coalitions with other social justice movements.
