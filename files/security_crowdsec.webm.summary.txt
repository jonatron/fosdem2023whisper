The talk introduces CrowdSec, a collaborative intrusion detection system that can ingest logs and detect bad behaviors to protect a Kubernetes cluster using it. The system is community-driven as users can write their own parsers to handle new services and share them with the community. The system also includes bouncers to remediate bad behaviors across multiple parts of the infrastructure and a reputation system to benefit from the community feeds. A live demo shows how QuartSec, which is part of CrowdSec, can detect bad behaviors on a Hello World app and block them using the Angelix bouncer.
