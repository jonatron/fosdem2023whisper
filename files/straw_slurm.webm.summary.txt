In this talk, Pablo discusses how to set up SLURM client environments more easily. SLURM is a resource manager and job scheduler commonly used in high-performance computing clusters. Pablo introduces SLURM and explains its components and how it works. He then focuses on using containers with SLURM for client-side tools that interact with the SLURM controller. He discusses the challenges of using containers and presents two options: either copying the SLURM configuration files into the container or using a config-less approach with SLURM's built-in support for JSON web tokens. He also presents a third-party tool called "Strong" that simplifies the process by providing a CLI tool to authenticate to the SLURM controller and fetch the configuration files. Pablo concludes by discussing the limitations of the tool and suggesting that it would be ideal if SLURM natively supported these features.
