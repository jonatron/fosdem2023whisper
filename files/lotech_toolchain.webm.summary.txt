This talk discussed the use of C++ standards in LibreOffice and how they are gradually moving towards the implementation of C++17 despite limitations. It also discussed some features found in more recent standards such as string view, comparison functions, unreachable magic functions, const eval and const expression, and module organization. The speaker concluded by encouraging the audience to test out the latest C++ standards in their compilers to find any bugs and submit them for fixing.
