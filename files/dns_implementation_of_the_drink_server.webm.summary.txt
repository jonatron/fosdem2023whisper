The talk is about a DNS server called Drink that is being developed using Elixir, a functional programming language that compiles to Erlang bytecode. The main goal of Drink is to provide a more feature-rich DNS server than the existing ones. It supports DNSSEC, TCP, NSID, cookies, extended DNS errors, and more. The talk also highlights the benefits of using parallelism in Elixir and the robustness of the server in handling various types of DNS requests. The speaker mentions the challenges faced during the implementation, such as supporting EDNS and properly handling DNSSEC. The talk concludes by discussing the performance of Drink compared to other DNS servers and the decision not to include caching functionality.
