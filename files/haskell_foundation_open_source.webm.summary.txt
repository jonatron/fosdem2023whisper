In this talk, David Christensen, the Executive Director of the Haskell Foundation, discusses the lore and values of the Haskell community. He emphasizes the importance of elegance, building functional software, and appreciating mathematical inspiration. He also highlights the community's culture of playing with ideas and its anti-authoritarian and independent nature. Christensen provides an overview of the history of Haskell, from its early development in the 1970s and 1980s to the current advancements in expressive type systems and concurrency. He introduces various Haskell institutions and projects, such as the GHC Steering Committee, the Haskell Foundation, and the Haskell Optimization Handbook. Christensen also mentions ongoing initiatives, including the Haskell error index, the security advisory database, and the Haskell Interlude podcast. He encourages community involvement, such as contributing to documentation, participating in workshops, and volunteering for various projects. Finally, he addresses concerns about the popularity of Haskell, explaining that he does not believe the language is dying and mentions anecdotal evidence of growth in the community and usage.
