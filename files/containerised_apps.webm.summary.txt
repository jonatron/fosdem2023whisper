In this talk at the FOSDEM conference, the speaker discusses their changing views on containerized applications, such as app images, snaps, and flatpaks, over the past five years. They initially criticized containerized applications for their security, maintenance, and licensing issues. However, they now believe that flatpaks are the better option for distributing graphical applications and recommend using flatpak and contributing to the platform. They also suggest that desktop Linux distributions do not need to package the entire software ecosystem and should focus on a narrower scope. The speaker emphasizes the importance of immutability in distributions and mentions the microOS project as an example. Overall, the speaker concludes that flatpaks are ready for primetime and invites the audience to embrace the platform.
