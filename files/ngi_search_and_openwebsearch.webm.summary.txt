 

The NGA Search and OpenWeb Search.U projects are two sister initiatives funded by the European Union which aim to challenge the way information is searched and discovered on the internet. They will provide financial and technical support to the accepted projects and hope to inspire contributors to develop innovative open search and discovery products and algorithms. The OpenWeb Search project will also create a European open web index collaboratively and distributed among several European institutions.
