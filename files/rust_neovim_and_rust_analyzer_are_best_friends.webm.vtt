00:00.000 --> 00:09.380
Andrei, he's going to talk about a new of them, I went through this deck, it's actually

00:09.380 --> 00:10.380
really cool.

00:10.380 --> 00:13.460
Before you go on, I need to give you this.

00:13.460 --> 00:14.460
Yeah.

00:14.460 --> 00:26.420
No, we need this one for the projection, so here we go.

00:26.420 --> 00:30.500
One, one, one.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.220
Can you hear me?

00:32.220 --> 00:33.220
Can you hear me?

00:33.220 --> 00:34.220
Yes.

00:34.220 --> 00:35.220
Cool.

00:35.220 --> 00:36.220
I can...

00:36.220 --> 00:39.100
I think I can fix it.

00:39.100 --> 00:44.340
I can use it, so let's start, so we don't have time.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.340
Okay.

00:45.340 --> 00:53.180
Today I will talk about Rust and NeoVim, so if you see something inaccurate, I'm new

00:53.180 --> 00:57.100
in Rust, so please don't judge me too much.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.060
A little bit about me.

00:59.060 --> 01:05.980
I'm Andrei, I'm from Ukraine, now living in Vienna, in Austria, I do a lot Go, Python,

01:05.980 --> 01:14.020
I love gymnastics on other stuff, I love speaking, I just dig talk in another room, so I just

01:14.020 --> 01:15.020
move forward.

01:15.020 --> 01:16.020
Cool.

01:16.020 --> 01:17.020
Let's start.

01:17.020 --> 01:29.740
So NeoVim is the most loved editor in 2021 and in 2022, and Rust is the most loved language

01:29.740 --> 01:36.980
in 2022, so I feel it's a win-win, it's the best combination you can ever see.

01:36.980 --> 01:41.060
So can you raise your hand very quick, who use like NeoVim or something?

01:41.060 --> 01:43.060
Oh, it's my audience.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.060
Nice, nice.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.060
Nice.

01:45.060 --> 01:46.860
So why this for you?

01:46.860 --> 01:54.820
If you like me, love to spend all the day, weekends, configuring my development environment,

01:54.820 --> 01:58.180
please don't tell it to my boss.

01:58.180 --> 02:04.100
And since all of you using NeoVim, I think you know how to quick from Vim, right?

02:04.100 --> 02:06.500
No need to explain, cool?

02:06.500 --> 02:09.900
So sugar smoking also, cool.

02:09.900 --> 02:16.740
So first things first, NeoVim is just a fork of Vim, which is focused on like extensibility

02:16.740 --> 02:17.740
and usability.

02:17.740 --> 02:26.140
One of the examples is they injected or added ability to write plugins in Lua, which is great.

02:26.140 --> 02:39.060
And since 0.5, as you know, NeoVim supports LSP client framework, all good, all good.

02:39.060 --> 02:45.340
This means NeoVim can work as a client to LSP servers like Rust Analyzer and building

02:45.340 --> 02:46.700
other tools.

02:46.700 --> 02:53.740
So to prove my words, yeah, if you open NeoVim and type help LSP, it's like inside editor,

02:53.740 --> 02:55.260
which is nice.

02:55.260 --> 02:58.340
And you can read what you can do.

02:58.340 --> 03:07.780
So and for some of you who don't know what is LSP, very quick, so LSP is like a bridge.

03:07.780 --> 03:13.580
So now you can focus on developers of language servers, can focus on developing language

03:13.580 --> 03:19.300
service, and developers of editors can focus on editors.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.700
And it's like win-win again.

03:21.700 --> 03:28.460
Because previously it was like this, you need to write a tool, which format your code or

03:28.460 --> 03:35.300
whatever, it parse all three and depend on language, you can integrate it.

03:35.300 --> 03:41.660
And jumping between languages is hard, that's why it's nice when you have this LSP.

03:41.660 --> 03:46.580
So quick start, I assume you know how to install NeoVim.

03:46.580 --> 03:55.500
So if you never did it before, I highly recommend to start with this one file config, which is

03:55.500 --> 03:58.740
here and put it in your config location.

03:58.740 --> 04:06.540
What it does, it's very small, and it has few important plugins, which helps you to

04:06.540 --> 04:08.060
try it out.

04:08.060 --> 04:14.660
And I highly recommend to use it because it's easy to start doing something small and simple

04:14.660 --> 04:20.980
rather than starting like, okay, I need like lots of files, I need to repo for all my configs,

04:20.980 --> 04:21.980
et cetera.

04:21.980 --> 04:26.980
And as soon as you know more, you can refactor it.

04:26.980 --> 04:35.940
So in this file, include this new Mason plugin, which helps you to install language servers,

04:35.940 --> 04:42.460
which is handy, because you can do it directly from NeoVim, and it will install binaries

04:42.460 --> 04:51.980
directly to NeoVim standard pass, and when you start NeoVim, it will add this like location,

04:51.980 --> 04:56.580
so NeoVim and tooling will can communicate with these binaries.

04:56.580 --> 05:08.860
And it supports LSP, so also for debuggers, for linters, for motors, sorry, next.

05:08.860 --> 05:16.580
So when you're done, you can see this after complete, which is great.

05:16.580 --> 05:19.500
Another interesting feature you can do after imports.

05:19.500 --> 05:25.540
So for example, if you use hash map, but you forget to import it, I usually do it.

05:25.540 --> 05:26.820
It's very nice.

05:26.820 --> 05:35.100
And if you bind this code action, it will print you like different depend on which part

05:35.100 --> 05:36.820
of code you are.

05:36.820 --> 05:45.740
If it has any connections, for example, import hash map, you can type and import it automatically,

05:45.740 --> 05:46.900
and that's it.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.060
It's very cool.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.340
Same with rename.

05:50.340 --> 05:57.220
So now all haters of Vim can't say that you're renaming using grep, so you can rename using

05:57.220 --> 06:03.420
syntax tree, be smart, and using entire code base.

06:03.420 --> 06:04.420
And that's it.

06:04.420 --> 06:11.780
Yeah, I supposed to make a juice, but since we decided to reduce talk, I just have a picture.

06:11.780 --> 06:15.900
If you like me, forget your key maps, because you have tons.

06:15.900 --> 06:21.540
You can just use this nice plug-in telescope key maps and just remind yourself, oh, shit,

06:21.540 --> 06:23.180
just fuzzy find this.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.780
So very handy.

06:24.780 --> 06:32.380
For example, I forget LSP references, so I can find how to run it.

06:32.380 --> 06:39.100
And again, this LSP references is more or less language agnostic.

06:39.100 --> 06:43.860
It's extension of telescope, which like get it and show you.

06:43.860 --> 06:51.060
You can do hover documentation, you can do, I don't know, signature help, and many more.

06:51.060 --> 06:56.260
Other features, which I unfortunately can't cover in this short talk, but I highly recommend

06:56.260 --> 07:00.180
you go to this page and see how smart Rust Analyzer.

07:00.180 --> 07:08.500
It can do very nice refactoring, like, I don't know, apply Moore's law for your binary logic,

07:08.500 --> 07:14.740
replace some patterns, et cetera.

07:14.740 --> 07:17.740
So I'm personally using big config.

07:17.740 --> 07:19.580
You can, if you want, you can check it.

07:19.580 --> 07:22.300
It's more organized because it's really big.

07:22.300 --> 07:25.300
It's not one file.

07:25.300 --> 07:31.740
And if you need refresh knowledge about WIM, there are two really good books I ever read

07:31.740 --> 07:36.820
about editors, and you can play a little bit with WIM golf.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.740
If you never try, I highly recommend.

07:39.740 --> 07:46.340
Yeah, and a few references of guys which inspire me to use Neo WIM a lot.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.220
And thank you.

07:48.220 --> 07:49.220
Questions.

07:49.220 --> 07:50.220
Yeah, thanks.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.220
Questions.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.220
Yeah, thanks.

07:52.220 --> 07:53.220
Yeah, thanks.

07:53.220 --> 07:54.220
Yeah, thanks.

07:54.220 --> 07:55.220
Thanks.

07:55.220 --> 07:56.220
Thanks.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.220
Thanks.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.220
Thanks.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.220
Thanks.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.220
Thanks.

08:00.220 --> 08:01.220
Thanks.

08:01.220 --> 08:02.220
Thanks.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.220
Thanks.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.220
Thanks.

08:04.220 --> 08:05.220
Thanks.

08:05.220 --> 08:06.220
Thanks.
