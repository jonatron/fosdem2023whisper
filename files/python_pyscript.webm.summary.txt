The talk is about a framework called PyScript which allows users to write Python code in HTML files and run Python applications in a browser. The speaker explains that PyScript is not a new language, but rather a framework that compiles Python into WebAssembly. They discuss the benefits of using PyScript, such as running applications on the front end to reduce resource usage and provide a sandbox for users. The speaker also gives examples of how PyScript can be used with other frameworks and libraries like Django, D3, and Folium. They mention that PyScript is still a young project with ongoing development, but can be a useful tool for running Python code in the browser.
