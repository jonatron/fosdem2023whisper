The speaker, Tomasso, discusses how to build a snake game using Rust and WebAssembly (WASM) and introduces the concepts of WASM, including its target audience of the web and portability. He explains the constraints and limitations of building a WASM in Rust, including the need to treat all types, exported structures, and implementation blocks. Tomasso demonstrates two implementations of the snake game, one without any dependency and the other using Bevy Engine, an entity component system. He shows how to use events and resources in Bevy Engine to ensure that the game runs at the correct intervals and how to parallelize the systems within Bevy Engine. Finally, Tomasso presents demos of the snake game built using both implementations and provides a brief overview of the code for each.
