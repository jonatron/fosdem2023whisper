The speaker, who has over 20 years of experience with Linux and computers, talks about a new smart home hub from IKEA. They appreciate the device but only as long as the data stays with them on their local computer and it runs as much open-source software as possible. The app is simple and opt-in for sending usage data to IKEA. The device uses a dual-core STM processor, a single DDR3 memory chip, and dual ZigBee/Bluetooth radios. The speaker was able to obtain the source code from the app's link to the gplcode.ikea.com website, but they found that the compilation scripts and source code modifications were not included. The speaker concludes their talk by telling IKEA that they need to provide these missing elements for users to be able to flash their own hardware with the received GPL code.
