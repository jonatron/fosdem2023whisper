In this talk, the speaker discussed the long history of Elixir and Erlang, and ultimately asked the question of whether Elixir is legitimately a new innovation or just a new label on an established set of languages. The speaker argued that Elixir does add something to the existing language ecosystem by making machine learning easier, introducing a build tool, providing better documentation with doc tests and creating an open and welcoming culture for new programmers.
