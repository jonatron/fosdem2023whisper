The talk is about supporting old proprietary graphic formats, specifically the WMF and EMF formats from Windows. The speaker discusses the difficulties in supporting WMF files, which are application and device dependent and cannot be queried for device resolution data and font metrics. The speaker provides tips for debugging WMF files, such as getting the drawing commands, identifying problematic commands, reducing relevant commands, and creating unit tests to confirm fixes. The talk emphasizes the importance of monitoring WMF files to ensure that fixes do not break anything in the future.
