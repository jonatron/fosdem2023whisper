The speaker, Josie, talks about the importance of designing open and inclusive pedagogical materials to teach programming, based on the principle of prime. They describe micromaterials, an open education resource with automated feedback, and offer examples such as an HTML environment, a database practice application, and a social game called coding card conundrum. Josie emphasizes the need for a silly yet realistic theme, social aspects, minimal setup, a focus on one specific learning goal, and automatic content generation. They encourage the community to contribute to learning environments and support the inclusiveness of programming education.
