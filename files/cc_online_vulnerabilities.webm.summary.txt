The speaker, Hugo Le Fevre, a PhD student at the University of Manchester, presented his research on compartment interface vulnerabilities at the FOSDEM conference. Compartmentalization is the decomposition of software into lesser-privileged components, which can help improve security by restricting access to sensitive resources. However, Hugo highlighted that compartmentalization is not without its challenges, especially when it comes to cross-component interfaces, which can become a potential attack surface. These vulnerabilities, referred to as compartment interface vulnerabilities or SIVs, can lead to data leakages, data corruption, and temporal violations. Hugo introduced Comfuzz, a specialized fuzzer designed to detect SIVs, and used it to analyze a dataset of SIVs in various applications and interfaces. The study found that SIVs are prevalent in unmodified APIs and vary in severity across different scenarios. The impact of SIVs can be significant, with a majority of scenarios having at least one write vulnerability and a considerable number of vulnerabilities being arbitrary, allowing attackers to read and write anywhere. Hugo also discussed the importance of considering SIVs in compartmentalization approaches and proposed guidelines for designing more secure APIs. He emphasized the need for more research in addressing and mitigating SIVs systematically.
