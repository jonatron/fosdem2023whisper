00:00.000 --> 00:29.880
I hope that there will be someone here who raises their hand, and they can come, I do

00:29.880 --> 00:34.840
the talk instead of me because they know better, but unfortunately none of you.

00:34.840 --> 00:46.160
I'm going to convince myself, I'm already convinced, convince yourself that we can

00:46.160 --> 00:55.400
finance open source by small companies. We are giving one person of the income to

00:55.400 --> 00:59.640
open source project, I'm going to convince you that all of the small companies in

00:59.640 --> 01:05.200
open source can do that, and we can change, we can change much in the open

01:05.200 --> 01:14.720
source world with that. Do you know what it can be, 23.1 million?

01:17.160 --> 01:25.560
Huh? Hard question. That's the number of small companies in the European Union. Wow.

01:25.560 --> 01:32.160
How many of them do the computing science? How many of them use open source

01:32.160 --> 01:38.040
every day? How many use open source every day? I would say half probably, but how

01:38.040 --> 01:46.960
many are contributing and are constant users of open source? Way harder to ask.

01:46.960 --> 01:56.720
Are you the same that at least 5,000? Imagine now that 5,000 companies, which

01:56.720 --> 02:05.840
is not that optimistic estimate, each of them giving 1,000 euros per year. The

02:05.840 --> 02:11.680
total budget you get is 5 million. What we can do for 5 million in Europe, quite

02:11.680 --> 02:17.920
much, and 1,000 euros per company, it's not high number, it's really a

02:17.920 --> 02:26.280
pessimistic estimate, so we can do way better than that. Before we get to the

02:26.280 --> 02:31.960
details of the product smart dictionary check, we are in Europe, all of us talking

02:31.960 --> 02:38.840
about taxes, incomes, and financial things we are using our own languages, and we

02:38.840 --> 02:45.160
need to have a dictionary check when we are switching to English. So, turnover,

02:45.160 --> 02:51.760
income, gross revenue, same thing, it's all sales of a company over a period of

02:51.760 --> 02:57.320
time, usually a year, and profit, it's earning minus all of the expenses that you

02:57.320 --> 03:04.600
have. What I'm convincing you that you can give 1% of the income, so all sales

03:04.600 --> 03:12.400
is really a year. Now, my personal point of view,

03:13.400 --> 03:21.880
SysLineBit is a company running multiple economic activities under one roof, and

03:21.880 --> 03:26.120
we are helping new activities and new people to be their activities. It's a

03:26.120 --> 03:33.080
pretty specific type of a company under the French law called CEL. We are

03:33.080 --> 03:37.040
concentrating on embedded and open source, so we are strong supporters of

03:37.040 --> 03:42.520
open source. Currently, in our model, everyone is a consultant, but we welcome

03:42.520 --> 03:50.280
production, system admins, and all other types of activities. Currently, every

03:50.280 --> 03:59.720
consultant gives 1% of their income to open source project. As we hold multiple

03:59.720 --> 04:03.960
independent activities, every person decides on their own to which project

04:03.960 --> 04:10.640
they want to give, because we have different preferences, and I started that

04:10.640 --> 04:17.760
when it was a one-person show, when I started a company two years ago. A small

04:17.760 --> 04:27.600
reminder, 1% of income means 1,000 euros for every 100,000 of income. The

04:27.600 --> 04:33.160
idea of one person is not a new one. You have probably seen about one person for

04:33.160 --> 04:37.920
the planet. There have been a few initiatives of giving to open source,

04:37.920 --> 04:43.920
but I think it's good to bring the idea back, because we are always, as always,

04:43.920 --> 04:52.240
missing money in open source. Now, when the company gives a donation, what it

04:52.240 --> 05:14.000
needs? In voice!

05:14.000 --> 05:26.520
I was shouting too much, I think. When you're running company, you need an

05:26.520 --> 05:33.920
invoice for every single expense you have, and if you pay first and then wait

05:33.920 --> 05:40.360
for the invoice, you have a risk of not getting it at all, or getting after a

05:40.360 --> 05:48.440
long time. Last year, I have given to one of the organizations in open source,

05:48.440 --> 05:56.640
everyone here knows, and I'm not going to name because, and it took me like four

05:56.640 --> 06:01.800
or five months of email exchanges with a person who was very sorry that they

06:01.800 --> 06:05.000
cannot get to the person doing the invoices, they cannot give me an invoice,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.640
they are going to send them a message yet again, and I was a month again, I was

06:09.640 --> 06:16.400
sending the message again. Finally, got my voice like five months later. That is

06:16.400 --> 06:23.760
risky, I was already thinking how to explain that to my accountant. A company

06:23.760 --> 06:30.200
can go through a method used by big companies, purchase order that the

06:30.200 --> 06:36.280
company gives, then the recipient of the money gives the invoice, and then you

06:36.280 --> 06:41.640
pay. Problem, it's a burden, it's a burden organization you give, and it's a

06:41.640 --> 06:48.640
burden for the company giving the money. But that's the solution I use for

06:48.640 --> 06:55.480
bigger donations when I cannot risk of not getting the invoice. For individuals,

06:55.480 --> 07:04.920
they are all their ways to donate. If a company wants to give money to an

07:04.920 --> 07:13.000
individual, that's complicated. For the tax reasons, for the legal reasons, so we

07:13.000 --> 07:21.640
avoiding giving money directly to individuals. For cryptocurrencies, some

07:21.640 --> 07:33.960
projects accept cryptocurrencies. I leave you the question to ask your

07:33.960 --> 07:44.120
accountant, and then you need to be sure you can run away from the place. The

07:44.120 --> 07:49.320
reaction varies, but may be drastic when you talk to accountant about

07:49.320 --> 07:57.720
cryptocurrencies. So no, if you do not want to run into trouble, you do not run,

07:57.720 --> 08:05.640
you donate in cryptocurrencies when you are running a company. Now, typical

08:05.640 --> 08:09.720
open-source organizations supporting projects, what they offer for companies.

08:09.720 --> 08:17.080
Either yearly sponsoring, or even sponsoring. That is something that exists

08:17.080 --> 08:24.480
for most organizations. Typically, a sponsoring is from 1,000 to 25,000

08:24.480 --> 08:31.960
euros depending on the level. Even sponsoring is between 500 to around

08:31.960 --> 08:41.880
10,000 euros. Now, we compare that with what a small company can give. In a small

08:41.880 --> 08:47.200
company, I have an alternative. Either I give 1,000 euros to one project,

08:47.200 --> 08:58.120
eventually two, or I give 100 euros to way more projects. For people who live in

08:58.120 --> 09:04.240
open-source, we know that if I give to project X, someone will ask, but why you

09:04.240 --> 09:12.120
are not giving to project Y and Z, and some more, right? Because if you are

09:12.120 --> 09:19.040
going to one project, it's fair to give to all others. Opinions differ inside the

09:19.040 --> 09:28.400
company who is using which project in the products. Exactly. At the end, what

09:28.400 --> 09:36.880
happens is you want to give smaller amounts to more projects. And that is

09:36.880 --> 09:42.320
exactly not in line with what the organization supporting open source

09:42.320 --> 09:52.840
have as an offer. Our way of doing the donation is giving directly to

09:52.840 --> 10:00.880
organizations. So we establish the way of how to do the payment. So either they

10:00.880 --> 10:06.600
have an account that you can create and then donate, or you need to contact some

10:06.600 --> 10:13.960
email address and figure out the details. Things vary. And then when we have the

10:13.960 --> 10:21.160
methods set up, we have that organization now, a database, and every

10:21.160 --> 10:28.920
transaction later, it goes the same way and it works. There are other ways using

10:28.920 --> 10:36.280
aggregators, like GitHub Sponsors, Open Source Collective, or Linux Foundation

10:36.280 --> 10:42.280
crowdfunding. And there has been a talk about the subject by Wolfgang at the

10:42.280 --> 10:47.680
Open Source Summit Europe last year. He had a pretty different approach because

10:47.680 --> 10:54.480
that was from the approach of a big company with more internal difficulties

10:54.480 --> 10:59.160
of having the donations done than we have in small companies, but still his

10:59.160 --> 11:11.600
analysis of the ways you can donate is pretty interesting. Now, is it hard to

11:11.600 --> 11:19.800
donate to an open source project by a company? Financially, the amount of

11:19.800 --> 11:26.880
money, one person, if you compare it to different expenses you have in a company,

11:26.880 --> 11:36.280
accounting, rent, internet access, electricity of whatever you have, it will

11:36.280 --> 11:43.000
be in the small things that you have on the company bill. So it's not really

11:43.000 --> 11:50.520
that hard to do. What is a little bit more complicated is the organization. And

11:50.520 --> 11:57.640
what I found out is most complex is actually deciding to which project you

11:57.640 --> 12:06.800
want to give, even in a company when everyone agrees, we want to give. A lot

12:06.800 --> 12:12.800
of discussions and a decision-making on how to do that. And then important thing,

12:12.800 --> 12:17.000
collect and document the payment procedure if you're not going through an

12:17.000 --> 12:34.240
aggregator. Important thing. Now, you would ask why? Project work as they can. And when

12:34.240 --> 12:38.400
you are already doing open source, you can say that you are already contributing

12:38.400 --> 12:46.880
and there's a kind of donation you are already doing, right? I would say that

12:46.880 --> 12:51.880
this is an addition to the work you are doing because you cannot take

12:51.880 --> 12:57.600
a maintenance in every single project you are using in your product. That is just

12:57.600 --> 13:05.240
not possible. And this is the maintenance work, infrastructure, all those hard to

13:05.240 --> 13:13.160
sell us new features that need financing the most. In my opinion, that works

13:13.160 --> 13:17.480
easiest with the money because you can just pay someone spending their time on

13:17.480 --> 13:27.640
doing those tasks. And then, a subject related to the presentation before.

13:27.640 --> 13:34.760
Currently, quite many organizations I was involved with, they in reality

13:34.760 --> 13:42.280
depend on donation from a small number of big companies with a part of

13:42.280 --> 13:48.920
individual donations that they receive. So, if you can break that dependency and

13:48.920 --> 13:57.640
make sure that those projects have more stable and more diversified way of

13:57.640 --> 14:04.160
getting the income, that is going to improve the stability and at the end is

14:04.160 --> 14:12.520
going to improve the quality of the code we all depend on. So, are you ready to

14:12.520 --> 14:18.960
try it out with your company? Or do you have any questions, subjects for

14:18.960 --> 14:30.280
discussions? In the meantime, we try to fix the microphone and so take a bit of

14:30.280 --> 14:44.880
time to question them. Okay, there we go. What can open source projects do to make

14:44.880 --> 14:50.040
this easier? Like for example, something that I run a scientific open source

14:50.040 --> 14:53.960
project, we're looking at trying to incorporate as a non-profit because we

14:53.960 --> 14:56.760
think that will be more attractive and we're trying to figure out where to do

14:56.760 --> 15:00.440
that and deal with all of the international stuff and it's a whole thing.

15:00.440 --> 15:05.880
So, I guess, what do you see from the small business perspective as to what

15:05.880 --> 15:11.880
projects can do to make you're giving us money easier?

15:15.960 --> 15:21.120
Yeah, so hold on. Maybe we collect some questions first and then in between we

15:21.120 --> 15:26.520
can fix the mic issue. Would it be fine for you? So, that's why maybe we collect

15:26.520 --> 15:34.480
some questions or is it okay? Okay, the question the question is how the

15:34.480 --> 15:41.240
project how a project can make it easier. For me, it's very simple. Have a legal

15:41.240 --> 15:52.280
entity that can create invoices or any legal proof of payment for the

15:52.280 --> 16:01.840
amount and make this make it easy for a company to do that. So, make it easy in

16:01.840 --> 16:11.120
such a way that when you get a message that we want to give you 500 euros, we

16:11.120 --> 16:17.760
get a response rapidly that increase confidence that's going to work.

16:17.760 --> 16:31.360
And then you can, if you are ready to send an invoice just at the moment of

16:31.360 --> 16:39.120
payment, that helps. If you have a system that generates invoices, it's even

16:39.120 --> 16:45.280
better. You can use online invoice generation systems that exist. If you can

16:45.280 --> 16:50.440
use it, it's even easier for everyone. But it's a really, really simple fast

16:50.440 --> 16:58.000
reaction time and getting the invoice easily. If I have those two, I will be

16:58.000 --> 17:06.440
willing to donate again. Okay, so we have another question over here, two

17:06.440 --> 17:16.840
ones. So, mainly the perspective on us was by a company's perspective. And this

17:16.840 --> 17:20.960
topic has been discussed by the Node.js technical theory committee just

17:20.960 --> 17:26.840
recently as I'm part of that. And Node.js is a part of the OpenJS foundation

17:26.840 --> 17:31.960
and money is actually not an issue. That's not the main problem. What we need

17:31.960 --> 17:39.440
is actually people donating their time and effort into projects. And that is way

17:39.440 --> 17:45.360
more valuable as such. So, if a company, instead of investing money, because it's

17:45.360 --> 17:49.160
really difficult, even like for an organization, you know, you have to

17:49.160 --> 17:53.400
decide who's actually going to get that money. Do we pay someone? What is with the

17:53.400 --> 17:58.120
others who contributed? It's a really tough question to answer. If it's not a

17:58.120 --> 18:04.760
single contributor to this open source project, and therefore, just if you

18:04.760 --> 18:12.040
pay someone from your company to work on that project, that is mostly really,

18:12.040 --> 18:23.680
really valuable. Thank you. So, that was a pretty important subject when in a

18:23.680 --> 18:32.320
situation when the money is not really an issue, people are an issue. And my answer

18:32.320 --> 18:39.760
here will depend on the type of the development we are on. In my case, for

18:39.760 --> 18:48.400
most of the projects, we donate small amounts like 100 euros per year, 200

18:48.400 --> 18:52.800
euros per year. That amount of money doesn't allow you to hire anyone to work

18:52.800 --> 19:00.520
on the project. What would be possible would be to donate to an organization

19:00.520 --> 19:06.960
that will hire that person, and have multiple companies donate to that person

19:06.960 --> 19:14.800
and then hire. Also, hiring someone for a small company, it's an important risk if

19:14.800 --> 19:22.000
you do not have funding. Hiring someone for me is more of an approach. Either you

19:22.000 --> 19:27.280
have a business model closely related with the project, if you are really doing

19:27.280 --> 19:32.840
money with that specific project, then it makes sense. Or if you are a company of

19:32.840 --> 19:39.640
like 50, then you can probably allow that. For small companies, I think it's a

19:39.640 --> 19:45.600
little bit more complicated, unfortunately. Also try to...

19:45.600 --> 19:52.120
We have another question over there. I'd like to highlight a service by a small

19:52.120 --> 19:56.720
NGO from Berlin. It's called the Center for Cultivation of Technology, which is

19:56.720 --> 20:03.000
like a back-end to open-source projects. They're registered non-profits in Berlin,

20:03.000 --> 20:09.040
and if you are a small open-source project which doesn't have a company

20:09.040 --> 20:14.680
somewhere or a legal name to it yourself, you can go there and say,

20:14.680 --> 20:19.960
hey, I'm an open-source project, and they could act as a trustee. They

20:19.960 --> 20:26.320
receive donations and they can hold that for your project, so companies can get

20:26.320 --> 20:32.560
invoices or checks that the money has been sent there, and the software

20:32.560 --> 20:37.520
devs don't have to care about all the financial stuff for that. There is

20:37.520 --> 20:41.720
a back-end to support open-source projects and to make invoicing more

20:41.720 --> 20:51.760
easier and at no cost. You want to respond to that? A small comment for that. Thank you

20:51.760 --> 20:56.840
for doing this, and if you could send me the test of the foundation, I would be

20:56.840 --> 21:03.320
interested in all initiatives that allow that aggregating payments for

21:03.320 --> 21:14.480
different projects. My question is, well, I thank you for mentioning fiscal

21:14.480 --> 21:17.440
sponsorship organizations, and I want to give a yes, software freedom

21:17.440 --> 21:20.400
conservancy is a fiscal sponsor organization as well as there are many

21:20.400 --> 21:26.400
others, and I know that several of us are very interested in making sure that the

21:26.400 --> 21:31.800
projects we accept and therefore take donations for are have great governance,

21:31.800 --> 21:36.360
and so there can be trust as far as making sure that funds they're donated

21:36.360 --> 21:42.240
or used for the project and are used wisely. How do you evaluate governance for

21:42.240 --> 21:48.720
these donations, or do you not because there's smaller donations? I think we

21:48.720 --> 21:54.440
are trying to test. It's working. Okay, the question was how we evaluate that the

21:54.440 --> 22:01.680
money is going to be well spent. I'm taking a shortcut. We are donating to the

22:01.680 --> 22:08.560
projects we know very well. So that's easy. We know the governance. We know how

22:08.560 --> 22:19.880
they work. So the check is easy. Donating to projects that we know less, I would

22:19.880 --> 22:25.720
definitely agree that getting to a project that is in some aggregator that

22:25.720 --> 22:35.800
has policies on the governments, that's an additional plus something point for

22:35.800 --> 22:41.200
this project to actually donate it. Then to a project that we just absolutely

22:41.200 --> 22:46.680
do not know how they work, what's going to happen, the answer to an email after a

22:46.680 --> 22:51.440
month, and things like that. That's definitely a bonus point for that

22:51.440 --> 22:57.440
project to getting a donation. Absolutely. Okay, so we have another question over

22:57.440 --> 23:10.320
here. So coming back to what you said earlier, like at least when you're a

23:10.320 --> 23:15.320
computer company, then you can definitely let someone work at least part

23:15.320 --> 23:19.520
time on open source. That would be something really valuable again. I

23:19.520 --> 23:24.880
encourage people in my company that are working to work on open source and we

23:24.880 --> 23:30.160
have dedicated time that they may invest into that. Even as a small

23:30.160 --> 23:37.280
company, I was able to work on open source because we used open source and we

23:37.280 --> 23:42.400
ran into bugs, for example, while developing things. Then I discussed

23:42.400 --> 23:47.360
that with the leadership at that point of time. Instead of having a workaround

23:47.360 --> 23:51.320
built into the application that we are currently building as a closed source,

23:51.320 --> 23:56.120
hey, why am I not going to fix that bug in that open source library that we are

23:56.120 --> 24:00.000
currently using, and that's what I did.

24:03.440 --> 24:10.840
You want to write? Yeah, very good. I think you have my mic. I have my mic.

24:10.840 --> 24:18.040
Sure. I completely agree. The money part for me is an addition to all the

24:18.040 --> 24:25.160
other open source work you do. We as an open source company, we propose to our

24:25.160 --> 24:31.480
customers to upstream the code. We tell them we can upstream the patches

24:31.480 --> 24:37.280
that you have, the fixes that you have. We can help you with working with

24:37.280 --> 24:45.280
the open source work for your project. The money part is an addition to that.

24:45.280 --> 24:53.360
If you are already open source citizen, that's already great. But what I

24:53.360 --> 25:01.280
found out is that quite many projects I'm involved in Yocto. I have a

25:01.280 --> 25:06.160
lot of experience in that. That's the maintenance part that requires time and

25:06.160 --> 25:13.520
convincing customers to have people working and maintain us. It's even a

25:13.520 --> 25:19.760
problem for the Linux kernel. Yeah, so it's a bigger problem and I think that

25:19.760 --> 25:26.400
without financing people separately from that, I'm not really going to happen. It

25:26.400 --> 25:30.360
already happened with different funding for different open source projects for

25:30.360 --> 25:36.720
the maintenance part. If you can go forward with that, that's going to

25:36.720 --> 26:01.720
help. Time's up. But we're happy to discuss with all of you in the corridors.
