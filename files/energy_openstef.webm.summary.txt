In this talk, Frederik Stool from Alliander discussed OpenStaff, a machine learning pipeline for short-term energy forecasting, and how it is being used to enable smart solutions such as flexible energy consumption and grid insight. OpenStaff can give grid operators the ability to better plan for energy production and consumption, improve grid safety, and enable smarter solutions in the energy sector.
