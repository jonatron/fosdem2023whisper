At this year's FOSDEM, attendees experienced the event both online and in person. Attendees had access to 35 rooms, the network had 53,000 IPv6 addresses allocated, and could access a peak of 1.5 gigabits of concurrent stream. There were 400 hours of scheduled video, and Schwag was sold out. Matrix was available for participation, and the FOSDEM dance finished the event.
