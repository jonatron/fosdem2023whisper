The talk is about the current state of Linux on mobile devices and the need for better coordination and collaboration among distributions. The speaker highlights the progress that has been made in terms of running Linux on phones, but also points out the challenges and the lack of coordination between distributions targeting the same hardware and use cases. They propose the formation of a committee or a central place for communication where distributions and projects can collaborate, share feedback, and work together to address common problems. They also emphasize the importance of public representation and clear communication about the goals and benefits of Linux on mobile. The speaker invites everyone to join a working group or matrix room to discuss and find ways to become more organized as a community.
