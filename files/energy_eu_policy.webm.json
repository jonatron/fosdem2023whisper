{"text": " Ladies and gentlemen, members of the open-source community at the FOSDAM event, I am very happy to speak to you about the EU's energy policy and I would like to ask you for your help. But first of all, I would like to pay tribute to Shuli Goodman, the energy and drive that she brought to the global open-source community. To use it to fight climate change will really be greatly missed and my thoughts go out to her wife, her son, her family and friends. Now, to the topic of today, of course, the Green Deal is nothing new to you. We have targets for 2030 and 2050 in terms of becoming climate neutral in Europe, in terms of renewables, in terms of energy efficiency that are very, very ambitious. But as if that was not difficult and ambitious enough already, since Russia has invaded Ukraine, we have agreed to step up our ambition even further through the repower EU plan. So we visited the targets and we are changing the pace, not the direction. So we are still going in the same direction. We want to become climate neutral, but everything has to be faster. And becoming climate neutral depends, first of all, on bringing more renewables into the system. Indeed, this is a system challenge. It's about more electricity, but also backup and storage in other forms of energy. It's about more flexible, a smarter and a more digital energy system. And this is a system challenge that not one party can solve on its own. We need to work together to change it from production to consumption and everything in between, the grids, the networks, the transport. So this means that we need to share solutions and sharing solutions in the time like this, when it needs to be smarter and more digital, is all about sharing data so that together we can optimize the system based on good information, models, automated systems that know when to use what energy so that the use of renewables can be optimized into the system. And of course, when we talk about sharing data and when we talk about sharing solutions, open source is the excellent way to go. And in the Commission, we know that this is important, so we want to support it. And we do this in energy, in particular through the Horizon Europe work program, where you may have seen that several calls in the area of wind, solar, energy sharing, smart grids are all referring to the use of open source as a way to support solutions. And of course, open source starts with people talking to each other and understanding each other's problems and realizing that by working together, they can find better, more sustainable solutions that have a better chance of scale up. And that is also why we support this through Horizon Europe and through the digitalization of energy action plan that has come out in October of last year. So that's why I would like to ask for your help and keep the open source community vibrant, not just discuss it today at the FOSM event, but work together beyond this event, work together beyond individual products and beyond individual business cases, because after all, open source is a state of mind and a state of mind that we are going to need for the energy transition, and it translates beyond software and beyond solutions. It is needed for a system change that we are looking for. So I wish you a very successful event today, a very successful session, and I'll be very curious to hear what comes out and I hope that we will stay in touch. Thank you very much for your attention.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.72, "text": " Ladies and gentlemen, members of the open-source community at the FOSDAM event, I am very happy", "tokens": [50364, 17084, 293, 11669, 11, 2679, 295, 264, 1269, 12, 41676, 1768, 412, 264, 479, 4367, 35, 2865, 2280, 11, 286, 669, 588, 2055, 51100], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.18503455857972842, "compression_ratio": 1.421875, "no_speech_prob": 0.43289971351623535}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 14.72, "end": 21.12, "text": " to speak to you about the EU's energy policy and I would like to ask you for your help.", "tokens": [51100, 281, 1710, 281, 291, 466, 264, 10887, 311, 2281, 3897, 293, 286, 576, 411, 281, 1029, 291, 337, 428, 854, 13, 51420], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.18503455857972842, "compression_ratio": 1.421875, "no_speech_prob": 0.43289971351623535}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 21.12, "end": 26.64, "text": " But first of all, I would like to pay tribute to Shuli Goodman, the energy and drive that", "tokens": [51420, 583, 700, 295, 439, 11, 286, 576, 411, 281, 1689, 24722, 281, 1160, 25484, 2205, 1601, 11, 264, 2281, 293, 3332, 300, 51696], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.18503455857972842, "compression_ratio": 1.421875, "no_speech_prob": 0.43289971351623535}, {"id": 3, "seek": 2664, "start": 26.64, "end": 33.6, "text": " she brought to the global open-source community.
