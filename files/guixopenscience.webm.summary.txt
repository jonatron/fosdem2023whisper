The talk discusses the challenge of reproducible research in science, and how Geeks, a package manager, is helping with this issue. Geeks is able to control the source of variations in computational environments, and provides a way for researchers to reproduce experiments across different machines and time. Geeks uses a fixed version graph to ensure consistency and reproducibility, and allows for the production of Docker images and other container formats. The talk also touches on Software Heritage, a long-term source code archive, which Geeks uses to save package definitions and ensure their availability even if the original source disappears. Although the speaker acknowledges that Geeks alone cannot solve all reproducibility issues in science, it is a helpful tool for managing computational environments and ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different machines and time.
