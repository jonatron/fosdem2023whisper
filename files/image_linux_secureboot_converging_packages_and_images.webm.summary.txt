In this talk, Ludwig from SUSE discussed a proof-of-concept for a package-based system as an alternative to image-based systems. He proposed leveraging ButterFS for image-like functionality and discussed applications for verification technologies such as dm-variety and a FA policy daemon. The idea is to use packages as a base, but with the flexibility of being able to change them on the client side.
