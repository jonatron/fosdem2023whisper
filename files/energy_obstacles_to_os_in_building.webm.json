{"text": " Hello everyone at the energy left room at FOSDEM. My name is Felix Riemann and I'm happy to be here and present you some insights from projects at Einstein Center for the Future and Theo Berlin, both located in the heart of Berlin. And today I'm focusing on some technologies and some obstacles we find dealing with energy technologies and related open source software in the German research landscape. To give you a slight introduction, I'm going today to talk about why do we need open source software for buildings and energy, how do buildings impact climate, how can open source reduce that impact and what is the current state of open source. I'm going to give you a short brief review of funded project. I'm going to give you some major obstacles we identified with the usage of open source and how researchers are applying it currently and then last but not least, I'm going to give you an outlook where we will be in five years. But let's start with a short introduction of our job and our goal and why we think FOSDEM is the ideal place to be here. So we are doing, we are the accompanying research. So what we are doing is we are supporting more than 300 research projects and survive them merely through different means and our focus on different aspects of digitalization. So for example, we look at data governance, we look at which tools they apply, for what reasons do they apply these tools and we try to support and connect projects and this is especially why we're happy to be here at FOSDEM because we are coming from an energy perspective and we would like to get to know more people in open source community and get feedback from you and foster the exchange between the national research community and the international open source community to learn and foster the exchange. Our goal is supporting standardization and integration of software and standards so that other people can apply the solutions, we help our researchers that we support and reuse. And why do we think residential or buildings in general and neighborhoods are especially relevant for that case? So if we look in Germany around 35% of the end energy usage are related to buildings and around two thirds of that are related to residential buildings and the majority of that is for heating and as you can see here on the left there's some empirical data from buildings, energy usage, a lot of that energy usage is actually used in old buildings. And what we can see from that, that older buildings use more energy than new buildings because of variety of reasons e.g. different installation standards but also we can see that we need to focus on a specialty of buildings especially older buildings and keep in mind that with the long lifespan of buildings around 30 plus years as you can see here that tomorrow is building a built today so if we want to be climate neutral by 2045 we need to build climate neutral buildings now. And open source technology can help with that for variety of reasons especially in three strategies. They can help reduce the demand through installation of better insulation so if you for example have open planning tools you can choose the right approach and where to insulate, what to insulate and what is cost effective and can also replace technology you can find for example the perfect heat pump for your place which can replace the boiler you are using or you can also have better control strategies which is mostly applied in non-residential building so if you for example have a demand or crit orientated supplying approach that also reduces the total energy demand or makes it more crit friendly. So digital technologies are essential for climate friendly buildings for the three reasons and we need software to help to plan and run these buildings and our impression or our goal is to make this software open source because it can foster the transformation, it can make it cheaper, it can make it more transparent and also faster and how can they do that? For example I have five different light phases in a building this is for example the plan which we start normally and for example here we can apply open computer edit design so if we have better orientation in a building you also need less energy demand because the sun is actually helping to heat our work. If we are dealing with a build environment and we have a variety of tasks for example as build classification so we know which boiler is actually built in in the building and not only plan to build in which is huge hassle or huge hassle in a lot of actually building environments we're going to go in the usage phase monitoring can be used to deploy building control strategies we can for example see oh the heater is running while we actually also have an open window which is suboptimal so we can identify faults and if we look at the renovating phase of a building we can actually choose the right fit between technology and insulation and that's but not least if we go to more life cycle oriented approach. Material databases can improve the recycling quarter for example we need to identify which material is built where and where and how is it used or how can we reuse it and how is the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Fair helping to shape that so as you can see on the left there's roughly spend more than 100 million each year on research projects so that's quite a lot and just a short takeaway from this slide in the last few years it's been shifting from buildings to neighborhoods and to heating this networks and we say and we also can think if you look at general information that integration and linkage of different technologies is becoming more and more important and for example hence the funding for neighborhoods has been growing instead of isolated topics and what are these topics that are being developed so in 2021 we did the survey and we survived 179 projects and out of these projects around 128 said they were developing or using some kind of digital applications. If you're wondering why there's a huge gap to be honest we are also wondering but we also asked the projects to exclude the answers if they are for example using Excel as a software data developing and we see that actually quite often because if you're focused for an example on energy planners which are mostly self-employed very very tiny bureaus they actually use quite a lot of Excel so that's actually helping them but it's not the kind of software we are looking at so the software is excluded here and the kind of topics you see on the left side is mostly focused on simulation, operation optimization, monitoring, energy management, learning tools and what you also can see that none of the project is actually focused on social aspect so there's a huge gap in that on how we can include social aspects in digital aspects together in buildings and neighborhoods so if you're looking for a research project there it is and what did the project think about open source? A previous project by some colleagues of us did a survey in 2018 and they found that only minority of software or roughly 3% of Soviet projects planned for a full open source release of developed tools and software so that's not a lot isn't it and most of the software uses at least one proprietary tool so keep in mind that if they want to build software they use an average 4-5 other digital tools we call it a tool chain and I will talk later about this a bit more and the majority of these tools around 70% are not open source so there's not a lot of open source being released and there's also not a lot of open source being used what might be some reasons for that so there's a paper by some colleagues Stefan Feninger and all the papers from 2017 and they found some variety of reasons they focused on data and open source software and some reasons they find is that ag ethical and security concerns so there's sensitive and personal information might be included and through a variety of reasons everyone is afraid they might overshare personal and sensitive information unwanted exposure so if your stuff is public everyone can find the mistakes you make personally I think it's important to have stuff public because no one can find the mistakes and someone is referring to you and then they are repeating your mistakes so it's important to have stuff open so mistakes can be identified but that might also be a reason for some people not to have it because some of them might identify mistakes then we have to protection of intellectual property and I will talk about this a little bit more in the future but expertise is a business model or can be a business model and then we have institutional personal inertia so long-running practice are very hard to overcome especially for huge organizations that apply a different standard in a different methodology and let's continue with obstacles we find in our research landscape and especially related to buildings as this paper was more focused on energy systems engineering so I categorized in three categories starting with technical obstacles I will continue with cultural obstacles and finish with financial obstacles so especially in buildings and related technology we have a huge heterogeneity in data as you saw on a previous slide we have quite an age gap with a variety of energy demand variety of energy related technology and this also makes the software people deploy or develop for it quite heterogeneous because you have to for example identify different data points you have to example different ICT and so on so on the one hand some may think it's not worth publishing software anyway on the other hand some software may not be applicable at all because it's focused on a very special aspect so people think oh why make it open source but we think hey there might be at least a second person and it's public money then the two chains so if one part of the two chain is not documented at all or not open source or open science it cannot be reused and we think we need more modular and more and better documented two chains so the individual components need to be documented and well understood and then integrated in a chain instead of focusing on a complete chain and paper people should focus on the components and then we have missing open software which is especially relevant to cat and solvers and in some areas there's just like a huge gap and this leads to technical obstacles in making the complete system open source and as we can see on the right basic technical prerequisites is that the interfaces fit and we think that is relevant for all of these technical obstacles so we need to have fitting interfaces for data for the tool chains and last but not least for the missing open source software so we can have a whole ecosphere of software let's continue with the cultural obstacles we have a variety of cultural obstacles identified and one might be surprising but we actually have a lack of development skill in our understanding so software development is especially in mechanical engineering education and they're represented at least in Germany so that's our impression and also this leads to lack of common criteria for software quality so additionally in research software is often seen as a tool rather than an output so the researchers focus on publishing papers instead of publishing software and publishing the software is often overlooked or doesn't happen at all and last but not least I think this is more has more to do with the usage phase of software we did a survey in 2021 as previously said and out of the surveyed projects and only a minority said they are testing the software with their users so this in our opinion reduces the applicability and even if the software is open source no one is using it because it's not tested evaluated and the users don't understand it so we need a bigger um responsibility or bigger focus on using testing so the people that are supposed to use the software in the end actually using it last but not least we have the financial obstacles and especially the first one is relevant in our case so we quite often have enter funding so when a phd is done or project is finished and then you have to write your report but the report is just text and with that often uh no one any focus anymore on developing or publishing the software and we need to find a financial structure or funding structure that focus on also publishing all outputs in a well-documented and well-understood way then we have some business interest research is also a business having tools especially only for you can help you get new funding and can help you stand out and quite often we now see commercial alternatives with especially project partners wanting to have a long-term service agreement so they choose rather like um commercial alternative and then uh we have as they can provide a long-term service currently the maintenance the and the use of the software development of the software often ends with the project um participant of a workshop to us that we think it's important to find value behind project to have a community around open source deployed and this is why we need to focus on a value added to practice beyond your research project let me talk about the toolchain example as previous said a little bit more so quite often we have two people looking to build the software for the same solution so example you see user a up here and he wants to build um software for demonstration and user b or she wants to reuse that software but she's missing the license so she cannot reuse the tool or the software completely and she has to rebuild it so we have a lot of lost um power and we have a lot uh inefficiencies due to that and if you keep in mind that on average four or five tools are used to build software in your research project this happens actually quite often so we think partial open source is not enough we need modularized and well understood open source and only this can foster an open source culture as the software is only open source when all of the parts so to speak the complete toolchain are understood well documented and open source themselves this leads me to the recommendations i only brought six but we can discuss this later so as already said with the two chains i think modularized development is important so if you have each of the building stones of your overall software well understood documented and open source this enables maintenance and reusability of the whole software then we have user focused or more user focused software development actually the um software can be used and redeveloped and maintained after the project and we also need to focus on standardized interface interfaces especially with building technology and buildings as everyone is using some kind of object orientation but not the same so we cannot apply the same interfaces and so on and so on and so on and then we think it's important to publish this data scroll so actually we already have a lot of software and documentation and related papers but there's no general web page currently that publishes everything and collects everything that is being funded by public money so that's also an important step then also focusing on essentials crucial software e.g monitoring where which every project uses and every project or every building can use to save energy should be focused on and last but not least adapted funding because for maintaining software we often need ongoing funding structures let's come let me come to the last part of the presentation so you heard a lot about obstacles and i gave you a few brief introduction on what are missing stepping stones so far in the past but what's the current state of open source so on the left you see an argos which is a database where publicly funded projects are listed and if you look up open source you find around 446 projects at least in the beginning of January and the positive thing is there has been a sharp increase in recent years only 16 projects of these 446 projects have been started before 2010 but is quite often unclear what is considered open source and especially keep in mind the two chains is only the hardest open source everything can still be not reusable in open source way but i think there's been a sharp increase and we have a variety of open source projects listed and where we'll be in the next years so if we think about the future like for decarbonization and digitization of the energy system we need quite some building stones e.g infrastructure high quality data involvement of people as already said and if we did a server again in November 2020 and we asked around 250 researchers if there needs a promotion of open standard tools like energy plus and corresponding libraries and the majority of them agreed so with that outlook that everywhere that we think a lot of researchers and even the publicly funded structure is shifting to more open source approach and is considering the need for integration of these different opening open source approaches let me finish the presentation i'm happy to ask any questions here in the chat or per email and thank you very much for your attention and have a great day at FOSDEM", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek":
