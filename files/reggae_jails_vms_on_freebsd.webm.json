{"text": " Hello, and welcome to my talk about a tool called Reggae. It has something to do with a beehive and jail, and I'm going to explain what it actually does, why it does it that way, what are the goals and what's the initiative behind it. So the relevant thing about me is I'm a co-founder of Hacker Space in my hometown. I was lucky enough to marry this girl and she supports me in all my crazy IT endeavors. So Hacker Space was founded by us, and it's a place where I do most of my development in the open source community. I'm a free-biz user since 2016, I used it briefly before 5.0 came out, and I'm somewhat involved in free BSD, but I'm not a developer yet. I'm a CBSD contributor, and for those of you that don't know what CBSD is, it's a jail and beehive manager. It can also manage Zen and VirtualBox, but Reggae doesn't support these two. I decided to have only free BSD-native technologies supported, and obviously I'm an author of the software I'm about to talk about. So you might have seen similar tools like Vagrant and Docker Compose if you come from the Linux world, like I do. In that regard, it's not revolutionary, it's actually pretty same thing, run your development in a virtual machine or the jail, and currently jail has a really good support, beehive is worked on because it has different distributions of Linux, different operating systems, versions and so on, and it's a little bit harder to support because of those differences. And Oleg, who is a lead developer of CBSD, decided to create a CBSD file which resembles somewhat Vagrant file in ideas and not the syntax, and I decided to take a different approach. So it's kind of a silly situation currently that there are two CBSD DevOps tools, but we were trying out things and whatever works best is going to stay. I'm rooting for the reggae, of course, but so the concept is that, well, before I start with this, you would say the name of the project is reggae, I have a dreadlocks and I'm a musician, but I don't play reggae. It comes from a totally different idea. I had quite a few projects before this one that are all open source and now that, that had somehow referenced some songs or ideas from the reggae movement and music, and I said, okay, how about I name this one reggae and stop the streak of resembling something I actually don't want to resemble. So that's where the name comes from. It's me trying to come up with a name to stop the reggae streak. So the basic concept behind reggae is that it uses CBSD for all heavy lifting. All jail and beehive management is done with it. Some of the networking is done with the CBSD, some with RC.com. I'm going to get to that a bit later and reggae has two entities. One is a service, one is a project. I intentionally called it a service because it can be a virtual machine or the jail and the project is you might want to have different jails for different stuff like let's say you're working with WordPress as a hoster and you know you need the PHP with WordPress engine X on one side and MySQL on the other. You probably don't want all of that to be inside the same container so you can split those up. You can influence the order of creation and booting and everything. We still don't have dependencies between jails but we might have in the future because it's a really nice feature and you probably are not going to type all the commands to create the jail and then all the services inside of it. You're going to use some of the provisioners and I'm going to talk about that in a while. Where I come from that's basically Serbia. We don't have IPv6 and forgive me if I didn't implement IPv6 properly because I have a really limited resources in testing that. There is of course tunnels that I use and I try to combine stuff but yeah I'm basically with one hand behind the back. So I really try to support it. I just don't know if I've done it properly. Technologies, well it's a mouthful. With VNet Jails you can use DHCP and I almost insist on using VNet because for me as a system administrator it's easier than Jails. I just fire up the DHCP server, the DNS server, they are interconnected and to be specific DHCP is ICS, the DNS server is NSD and there's one more DNS caching which is unbound. There are, well all these technologies, you probably know what they are, the RTA DVD is for IPv6 as I mentioned and PF, you know what, I would love to add IPFW. This is the future so I don't cut off like I don't know what percentage of FreeBSD people but yeah we want to support everyone and everything ideally. And these to make and POSIXL are the only languages used to implement RTA. I could get away with it because the CBSD is doing the whole stuff and I just need to script a few things, right. As I said provisioners are supported, you don't have to use them, you can still just create a Jail and do your, maybe it's a lab and you're playing with it, experimenting and what not, but if you want you can run quite a few automation scripts and you can even have multiple provisioners for a single Jail. That sounds crazy but if you think about it, sorry wrong operating system, FreeBSD doesn't come with a pre-installed Python and if you want to use Ansible you are going to install Python first then the Ansible later and for situations like that it's really really nice to have shell provisioner doing like a first stage of the rocket launch and then Ansible does all the rest. I use shell and Ansible extensively and the rest of the provisioners I really try to support them, I used all of them or am using them at work or somewhere else but I'm not using them as extensively as the first two so if you find a bug please report it, I will be nice and fix it if I know how to. So Riot brings some things to the table that FreeBSD alone doesn't, I mean that's the reason it's created because it builds on top of something I personally consider a good software and what it brings is in order to run let's say re-enter Jails it will probably need a bridge and then some ePairs and so on but bridge interface has to be created or at least allowed different administrators to have their own configuration of a bridge and not actually enforce what a CBSD comes with by default and it's initializing network in such a way that PF is already configured, bridge is configured, IPv4 and 6 demons are stored at unbound and what not. So it initializes quite a lot and you might not like it and if you don't you have quite a few variables to disable stuff, for example you can disable IPv6 or have your projects resigned in a different directory not the default one and so on. So there's quite of initialization that it does because if you currently read how to start vNet Jail in FreeBSD it's not really easy, if you read it in different Jail managers it might be better, I didn't check other documentation so I don't know but currently FreeBSD documentation around Jail is kind of scarcely, not really depicting at all and one of the things that it helps you with is how do you even start with it. Because I come from a Linux world in 2016 I was like how am I doing stuff, what do I do, how do I configure it and that was actually the reason I chose CBSD. At the time it made most logical, it was the most intuitive tool for me to run my Jails. Since then I discovered it's good for other things not just intuition right but yeah I just love the software. The same is with CBSD initialization because CBSD can do quite a lot, it can track resources, it can give you the usage of network per Jail, it can do stuff and in order to do that it has to ask you things. For example, are you using IPFW or PF and things like that, are you using ZFS or UFS, what should I do, create clones or directories and so on. Ragga chose a different path or I chose it for it, you can say use ZFS, yes or no and if it's no luckily we only have two file systems so either you use ZFS or the other one UFS. So the initial configuration is quite easier with Ragga than CBSD and maybe if you're starting with a stack it's going to help you on your way from infancy to pro how to even start with CBSD and Ragga. There is one decision to, okay let me take a step back. I try to create everything as the code but some things are just not meant to be, like how do you assign addresses, CBSD has two, let's say two DHCP implementations. One is called DHCP and what it does is run through all the IP addresses and finds the first free one and assign it to Jail, only on creation so it's not going to scan every time just when the Jail is created it's going to scan them. So existing IP addresses and the configured IP addresses of Jails that are not stored it. So there is a second implementation of DHCP, it's called real DHCP. The idea is to have one master Jail that has DHCP and DNS in it, authoritative DNS in it and there is local unbound outside of Jail that says okay if you want a zone that your Jails are belonging to then look at here and it's from the Ragga and CBSD perspective. It's not so much about caching, actually it's not at all about caching although unbound is known for it and created for that purpose. It's more like how to call it a cop at the junction, you go there, you go over here and it's redirecting the queries. So the idea is that probably while developing with Ragga you're going to have a private IP address range and you want to still ask the DNS hey where is stuff because one thing that actually two things are annoying to me about Docker at least when I used it. Docker containers know by name where other Docker containers are but you don't. You have to use IP addresses or Etsy hosts, hackery or something and the second thing that really annoyed me is that I cannot have a user on this laptop with I don't know UID of thousand and one and have the same user in a Docker container and do development inside of Docker container. Just matching the ID's war was really terrible, I at least hope it was, it's not, it's not pertained but the idea behind that kind of frustration led to okay how about I have a DNS server, I mean it's what it's for to tell you where the IP address of this name is and so on. So yeah I couldn't create just the code, I still need one jail to do some maintenance stuff and some networking stuff. The nice thing about IPFW is that you can insert a rule whenever you want, if you're coming from Linux world that means it behaves like IP tables but PF doesn't and PF has a pretty static set of rules unless you're using anchors, anchors are a way to say okay this is a sub rule of the main rule and anchors can be changed and they are per jail called cbsd slash your jail name so it's easier to see which rules or for which jails and I don't want to trash Docker too much but if you've ever seen IP tables rules after the Docker mangles them it's a mess, it's a huge mess so I try to be nicer as much as technologists and freebies they allow, just don't be, sorry, don't be so negative towards developers and administrators they're going to hate you and so yeah when I say late these anchors are created after the jail is torrid so it already has an IP address and can use the port redirection whatever you need and yeah because until the jail is torrid it's already registered itself, got a lease and DHCP registered it in NSD zone so these anchors can use host names instead of IP addresses and if you're using DHCP you probably have no idea what's the IP address so the nice thing is that you can use names to really sort your networking and fire walling I would say in a proper way in a more readable way and there is a concept of in something called DevOps that I still don't know what it means they say the DevOps is IP accounting they know what not to click on AWS otherwise it's going to cost you so it's like it's like a administrator plus plus accounting right but yeah in a DevOps world you want your production to resemble development or maybe the other way around but yeah the fewer the differences between your development and your production the bigger the chances that you're gonna catch bugs in development not in production although users are the best monitoring system in the world okay so because of the vnet just the vnet implies that you're going to have to use some custom DFS rules because you want access to BPF you want access to PF so it can have its own its own firewall and naturally the FS rules are supported in reggae unfortunately by number not by name but hopefully that will change boot order is integer or should I say unsigned integer it works like nice the bigger the number the later you're going to boot so it's not a perfect solution but it's a solution to start your WordPress after the minus kill for example and it even works if you remove the reggae you create everything with reggae remove it it still works the boot order works so that I really try it to make booting really really work even if I did something naughty to my code and it breaks so I kind of have a failsafe I didn't know where majority of you are from but for some reason in Serbia package repository is extremely slow if I get two ambits that's like wow that's a light speed I don't know why it works like that maybe it's our providers because I talk to different people and they don't have that problem so I came up with solution work around what if all my jails just use proxy and first one is gonna download everything and it's gonna be painfully slow but the next one all the next ones were just gonna use the cached cached files and there is even a reggae recipe for proxy so you don't have to type in bunch of commands you just go to the repo download it type make and you're gonna have a proxy you're gonna have to change the configuration to tell it to use it but yeah it's as simple as it gets in my open source career I mostly work with audio and that's mostly graphical so I needed something like don't pollute my host and let me use jail for development but on the other hand let me click on the buttons because I need to so reggae has a really easy way of forwarding I think it's called forwarding in X open the port and all the X applications are connected to that port so X is on the X org is on host and your ex client is in inside the jail so you can interact with it and yeah it supports both but I'm gonna have to work real hard on this one as the newest addition to the source code so it it received the least amount of love and currently it only supports free bsd virtual machines what's beneath it is cbsd is using cloud in it to do your bootstrapping of a virtual machine to have the initial configuration and then your provisioner or provision nurse can kick in and do whatever you like whatever you told them to so what does development means well there is a devil mode because it's exposing so many things and doing it rather insecurely for the sake of a developer being able to do stuff I kind of think the devil mode is pretty good it's so close to the devil right so it has this development mode where you for example share your directory where the services with the with the jail I borrowed this idea from vagrant having a slash vagrant being a mount point of your project and you can interact with it either through the host or through the container so and yeah it's mountain and slash user slash source it kind of made sense because I kind of expect people not to do free bsd kernel or user space development inside a jail and you might find that an obstacle but you can still mount your own stuff on top of whatever right and see bsd do so you can add your mount points and stuff so it's not limiting if you're doing free bsd development which I expect some of you do it's not gonna be in the way this user is in is in the jail and it has the same user ID and group ID as the user host that execute it make inside of reggae service so that slash user slash source is all owner is the devil user and you can interact with it it's read write so the only difference is that the username and group name is gonna probably gonna be different why I say probably because I expect you not to name your user devil and there are well I was working in this I was pretty active for quite a few years as a web developer uh which is kind of strange for a free bsd guy free bsd contributor and what I realized is how about I have one line saying okay I'm gonna in these jails I'm gonna use like Django or something as as my framework that I'm gonna use so it does few alterations of how it does things so it lets you run your run your frameworks more easily and I shouldn't actually use plural because the only framework that's currently supported is called print it and guess who the author is but the idea is that you have a directory in your service called bin and inside of it you have a devil dot sh and reggae doesn't know what's inside of it it's just gonna run it inside the jail and usually for the web development I like to have a a tmax with a split pane back end front end and it knows how to tell front end where the back end API is if you need to integrate and you do so but basically you can create your own devil script and it's the reggae will be happy about it so it can do much more than just one framework but in the future I'm gonna add quite a few to make people know so much involved with jails easier to start using it so production does totally different thing I mean the opposite is gonna say okay this jail is gonna start with the boot of the machine it's also gonna try its best to remove everything discreet it like the user source mount the some of the some of the scripts they're installed for devil to work easily and so on so what's the idea here is that if you want to create like a build server or maybe on your machine you're using devil mode and you created it like that and then afterwards you say devil mode equals no make down make up and make up is gonna clean everything that devil created and then you can make export and create an image move it to some other server imported to there and it just means so that you can have like either your development container productionized not a good idea don't do it if you if you can avoid it but sometimes you can't and it works on my machine so ship it but the the more serious use case for it is to have your build server build the image of a jail and then you deploy it somewhere so this is an example of so up to here first recommends or creating the project and the project name is going to be as the directory you created so so the project containing multiple services well in this instance just want to make it compact so up to here is creating the project and then a project expects services directory to contain your jail or beehive definitions and the definitions are created with this you can omit this part and it's not going to create any provisioner for you or you can say here ansible shell puppet and that's the order of provisioners that are going to be run it has a few more expectations where things are going to be for a certain provisioner but it's going to create a skeleton for you so you don't have to create them by yourself and it's a well read the code if you have the skeleton it's going to be more intuitive what you should do next with your own code with your own development and it's pretty slick it can be done differently I just think to me this was most intuitive and I'm trying not to go against intuition so there is let's say all of us need something I don't know like MySQL we all here in this room are hosting WordPress and we all need MySQL WordPress and Nginx but you don't have to create it on your own there are pre-made recipes for that there are not images they are still in this instance they are all ansible but you can combine jails and beehives provision with different provisioners and in this case it's going to download these three jails configure them and interconnect them because Nginx has to know where the WordPress is and WordPress needs to know where the database is but it's not going to create a database for you it's still like okay I don't know what you want is it a single instance or you're hosting multiple WordPress instances and you need multiple databases and so on so that's left up to you but if you go to the MySQL everything is if you want to look at code of this just add jail dash MySQL and you're going to have the repository and there's a readme which tells you okay this is how you create a database in this jail so you can do it differently of course but if you're coming from a different environment I try to hold your hand as much as I can but you can't ignore it the same is for the WordPress and Nginx has a directory with quite a few examples how you create your own hosts inside the Nginx configuration but it's not going to configure it for you it's a recommendation and not not much okay you have to do it this way and this URL is probably the most complex project I did with Rage most complex in a sense that it has the biggest number of jails and services inside of it that need to talk to each other and well if you try to manage a driver and mail and do it responsibly you know that you need all the help you can get so I try to create this service that creates the mail and driver communication server it gives you the documentation on how you should configure your DNS what's what's inside of it the links towards specific services and their own configurations and examples and so on so it's my way of avoiding writing documentation I mean we all do that we have better things to do or better things to do so if you have an example it's a documentation on its own and yeah the future what can be better than documentation right but what I want to say is that Oleg who is a CBSD lead developer is Russian and I'm going to quote him my Russian is oh my English is terrible so our documentation currently is not good I'm not going to say terrible but but it's not good as it can be and that's literally our next assignment we already talked a few months before about it and the documentation is really killing us or the lack of good documentation and way of searching it and browsing it and and finding what you need there is quite a few documents there to describe how specific scenarios should be executed or specific commands what options do they have it just still needs to be worded better and more coherent and connected better so that you can say okay if I read this this and this I know where I'm where I'm going to be and then I know how to manage WordPress for example so documentation is a really big thing that maybe it's going to be only thing that we are going to work on besides the bugs so yeah sorry about not being very good with documents but we promise we will improve now these two I hope they are not mutually exclusive JillConf is a much much simpler way it's in the base it really works wonderful and it can even manage your beehive because today I don't know with which version it started but you can have a beehive inside your jail and if you have that you can only manage jail and that's kind of wonderful what we really need or at least I would like to have is a JailConf D working really great currently it doesn't one of the obstacles well two of the obstacles for you can in JailConf you can define dependencies between jails and that's how it's going to boot it's going to create a tree and then go from the leaves to the root but you can do that with JailConf D and there is a patch coming from a developer I know from Jerevan called Entranning and he promised he's going to upstream that patch this weekend so we are watching you but yeah it's almost it's almost there the second obstacle with JailConf D is that you cannot have common configuration like you can in a JailConf because JailConf is one file with multiple jails JailConf D is multiple jails oh sorry multiple files one jail per file you can probably have multiple jails per file but that kind of kills the idea so the idea is to have better service jail start or stop or whatever and then probably most of us jail managers developers are going to unite in it and say okay this is how we use it now you can criticize us and why didn't you do that in the first place right but I guess we need it to experiment and learn and see what what works and what not so that we know once we upstream it to JailConf it's going to be what we expect it to be and Kubernetes all jokes aside I don't know if you're following but there is more and more Kubernetes support in Potspree and there is I hope I'm going to pronounce the name properly Doug Robson is working on Kubernetes support Podman is already there and Doug has pretty initial version of Kubernetes working on FreeBSD with VNet and Jails why I'm hoping for this to happen is so that we can have easier transition from Linux to FreeBSD and honestly there's a friend of mine who promised me that we are going to try mixed Kubernetes data centers is a Linux freak I'm a FreeBSD freak so let's try to create one domain that is going to be mixed operating systems in Kubernetes who knows where it leads us maybe we just lose our hair but if we do succeed it's a really easy way to switch to migrate from one operating system to the other because realistically maybe you want to switch from FreeBSD to Linux please don't but yeah who knows what's your what's your use case and maybe your workplace is such that it simply has to be like that so yeah well I'm hoping this will not live because it leaves more space for this and so I'm kind of like a split brain person I really don't know what I want with Kubernetes it's it's probably here to stay so we need to support it in order to be kinder towards other developers and system administrators maybe DevOps so I would like to thank a few communities and persons till the center for supporting my crazy ideas and testing everything I do at least few of the people are testing my crazy ideas and reporting back and sometimes even doing slight development and I'm really grateful to be physically in an environment that is supporting me in such a way because usually I don't know about you but I suspect we are the crazy ones why don't you use why don't you use drugs like all normal kits or the docker or whatever right so yeah it's really nice to be supported the FreeBSD community I don't know how to say this enough they've been supportive and helpful and I didn't encounter a question that somebody didn't answer if I was persistent enough and CBSD community all again particular he created CBSD by himself and it's enormous task it even have and curses commands to make it easier for you so it's enormous task that well started 10 years ago 2013 and so it's our big anniversary this year I think it's somewhere during the summer but I will have to have to check that recently we announced that on CBSD site and I'm afraid I didn't remember it yeah it was few days before the FOSDM and I was doing bunch of things to to basically prepare so these are if you want to ask something contribute whatever is on your mind around regular CBSD or whatever music maybe these are my contacts and now is the right time to ask questions thank you oh he's gonna die he's gonna die you would for example my secular before workplace or there is also a mechanism that allows you like a reading a scroll to check if the database is ready to serve okay so the question was if I understood correctly if boot order can also check if the database started a bit before it stores the WordPress did I get it right no it cannot do that but it will at some point because the jail comf can have dependencies and at some point I'm really hoping to switch to dependencies instead of boot order because who likes boot order I mean if you have like 200 jails who knows what stores when but with dependencies it's much easier any more questions yes mostly for CBSD but you can find one for the reggae that depicts mostly how to initialize it and start the really dumb project that almost has nothing in it yeah sorry the question was I didn't catch that second one yes so the question was order any demos and they're on youtube some of them are on Russian and some of them are on how it's called askinema yeah so you can even from the demo you can copy paste the the text and do it yourself or commands or whatever okay anyone else okay then I'm gonna have to say goodbye with the famous words no docker no cry thank you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.68, "text": " Hello, and welcome to my talk
