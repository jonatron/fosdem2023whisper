The speaker, Conrad, talks about how the I2P network (an overlay network providing anonymity) has a DNS problem, as it does not have DNS itself. He tells of how he had a million other problems, unlike Geron who had performance issues while trying to parse DNS zone files. Conrad talks about how students from the University of Applied Science were given the task of looking into the DNS problem.
