The talk was given by Sairper Akdemir from Colobro Productivity at the FOSDEM conference in 2023. Akdemir discussed an interoperability improvement in LibreOffice Impress tables, focusing on a bug report that showed row heights being shrunk when a PPTX file exported by PowerPoint was opened in Impress. The problem was that PowerPoint exports row heights but doesn't define a total table height, making it difficult to layout a table correctly. To correct this, Akdemir implemented pre-layouting before importing the row sizes, and pushed the text properties from the n-paragraph run properties into the cells' properties. These fixes allowed for the removal of problematic regression causing code and the addition of unit tests.
