{"text": " Hi everyone, my name is Yaquo and today I'll be presenting your topic Linux on risk 5. I'll try to speak up so if you have any problems hearing me just let me know so I'll try to be louder. So what are we going to talk about? What? Louder, okay. So what are we going to talk about today? The topic is titled Linux on risk 5 but I'm actually going to talk mostly about gento support for risk 5 but we're also going to mention other Linux distributions how they handle risk 5 how other mainstream Linux applications are also supporting risk 5 and what what you can actually you know do using Linux systems on risk 5. So a little bit about myself I'm yeah my name is Yaquo coming from Croatia I work as a firmware engineer in Croatia most of my work is done revolving around better Linux development and integration however for my main job I do not work with risk 5 but I've been I had a privilege to contribute to open source as a gento Linux developer since 2021 and actually gento is where I've been able to get in touch with or get contact with risk 5 so I've been involved in a gento risk 5 team. Yeah I'll try to. So I'll try not to repeat too many details I'm sure most of you are familiar with with the architecture itself. So what is risk 5? So it's an open source instruction set architecture it was designed at Berkeley University in USA it was their fifth architecture which was designed hence the name risk 5. So how is it actually designed? It is designed to be a stable and modular architecture so we actually have a base base integer instruction sets that provide like stable base on top of you can up top of which additional instruction extensions can be built on. Nowadays it's led by risk 5 foundation which is organization which was founded to you know maintain intellectual property legal stuff related with risk 5 and so on. Speaking about risk 5 instruction set architecture so we have a three main base base instruction sets which is 32, 64 and 128 bits. All of them are designed so that they work or they are independent of each other so you cannot run there's no running 32 bit binaries on 64 bit systems. There's also 128 bit architecture but it's currently not frozen yet so it's still in for us the most important one is going to be risk 5 64 bit because that's the one that actually most most of the linear distributions are going to target. Now we mentioned some of the extensions so how they are designed? They're designed so they actually they can coexist with each other. They do not conflict with each other and they can be built on top of any of the previous base instructions we've mentioned. So we got some extensions listed here such as M for integer multiplication and division. We got A for atomic operations and we have a single double quad precision floating point. So how is actually naming convention works for risk 5? So first part of the name is actually base integer instruction so if you have risk 5 64 it's going to be usually rv64i and then we have additional extensions that are built on top of the base instruction so for example you could have MAFD or any extension that is built comes after the base integer. Nowadays we just to avoid having to write so many letters we're using a letter G which stands for general purpose instruction is just a combination of IMAFD because usually chips are designed to support all these extensions and then we have C which stands for compressed instructions. So now when we combine all this GNC we get RA64 GC to avoid having to write so many letters because it can expand to RA64 IMAFD which then expands to more letters depending on you know the version of extension that's implemented. Most most linear distributions will target RA64 GC instruction. So now let's talk a little bit about support in Gentoo. We have any Gentoo users in here? Alright okay. So I'm sure you know you've heard about Gentoo links so what is it? It's a source-based distribution and well this is actually the you know key feature that separates Gentoo from most of other mainstream distributions where usually you know when you want to download install package on your system your package manager downloads a binary pre-compiled package extracts it and installs it onto your system. While in Gentoo we you know we decided we're not gonna do any of this we're just gonna you know download and do compilation everything ourselves. So the main the core feature or the heart of Gentoo is its package manager called Portage. Portage is actually what allows you to have you know this really fine grained control over your system so you can choose many many different components when you build your system like you can choose a toolchain components you can choose your in-it system you can even change libc if you want it and so on. So it's actually designed to be like when you want to download Gentoo you just download a minimal set of it's called a stage three archive so it's just a minimal set of programs and tools that you can use to you know later customize to your own to your own needs. I've mentioned profiles and use flex is just some features of Portage that allow you to to maybe more easily you know customize and configure your system so profiles are basically set of configuration files that typically you select a profile when you do Gentoo installation so profile will you know it will determine what packages you will want to you want to install and what features you will have in your system. Use flags maybe the name is not so intuitive we can think of it as a feature flags or just configuration flags it's just a flag that package manager uses to determine whether you want to you know for example build one package with certain feature or not so let's say you want to install Gentoo on a system that doesn't have you know you're installing it on a server or a headless system so obviously you're not going to need support for graphics interface so what you can do you can just look up these use flags that are available in Gentoo and then you can just you know oh I'll find the use flag that controls whether my packages are built with or without no support for graphical interface you're simply going to turn this flag off and you're not even going to pull any of this stuff like X11 or Wayland whatever so you're going to have to you're going to be able to have you know system that is completely you know I'm not going to say bloat free but it's going to be very you know you're not going to have to you can customize it to your own needs that's the point. What architectures does Gentoo support so I've listed probably about 15 if I counted correctly so we actually have three levels let's say levels of support of architectures in Gentoo we have stable unstable and experimental as we can see risk 5 is currently in the unstable category well what's the difference between stable and unstable well the difference main difference is the architecture that are stable are going to receive much more testing you know continuous testing and unstable may have you know more bugs is not going to receive so much testing why why why risk 5 is still unstable well primarily because of there's no powerful hardware to enable us to you know compile these packages quickly enough so probably if we would try to turn risk 5 into stable architecture we would just would be too much you know time consuming and it would fail for some point but generally nowadays risk 5 support is quite good there's no you know pretty much is polished and you can you know mostly bug free experience in Gentoo okay so let's talk a little bit about history of risk 5 port so I joined Gentoo in 2021 but this this boarding was done before my time so it was around 2019 by our colleague Andras not sure maybe he's here today with us so he was he was the one that added the initial profiles for risk 5 so two targets two main targets that Gentoo supported and still supports are RA64 GC and RA64 IMAC but actually the RA64 GC is going to be the main one which we are going to focus on gets that it will get the you know the most the biggest level of support in Gentoo yeah yeah no they're just for comparison so 8000 packages supported on risk 5 yeah just to compare numbers with arm 64 so yeah when we do testing of our packages we you know always make sure that we run tests and we want to make sure that you know tests are all tests are pressing or as much as you know it's possible in reasonable extent so probably not every package will be able to pass test but we do our best to you know either the package is working correctly tests are passing or if we you know find an issue we're gonna try to fix it or at least report upstream if we're unable to fix so yeah in these few years we've been able to you know almost get to the same level as arm 64 support in Gentoo which I believe is quite good for such a new architecture so maybe you're asking yourself why would you choose Gentoo so you have a risk 5 system you have a you know small board or you bought yourself a first let's say toy risk 5 toy why would you want to use Gentoo so may not be like the first obvious choice but Gentoo gives you high degree of freedom of flexibility so you have control over pretty much any any component of your system you will also have a latest software available if you use Gentoo so we try to you know stay on top of most recent you know software versions packages compilers etc so you're going to be able to have a latest and greatest let's say of what's available in the you know software just distribution packages so it can be a really good platform for developing you can develop either natively or you can develop also on your you know your laptop which is going to be much much quicker if you don't want to spend money buying a board you can just you know you can set up a cross compilation build environment also with Gentoo we have a tool that's called cross dev which is just a wrapper scripts that enable you to set up cross completion environment for you know you can do for any architecture you want so then after you build your you know cross tool chain you can then compile all other components that you need that you want to you know like libraries binaries whatever you need and then you can even you can either boot this image in QEMU and then work work over there or you can just like create your own bootable image and then put it on on your sd card and then if you have a board boot that so stage archive so I think I mentioned stage is basically just a simple it's a terrible that when you extract you get a minimal minimal Gentoo system which you know it will contain like libc tool chains tools you need to download and build your own programs or other packages so I've listed here well if you go to gentoo.org slash downloads you're going to have a an overview of you know every architecture and every stage you can download for every architecture I've listed some of the available archives for for risk 5 here so we got lp64d and lp64 abi images but the main ones are the main ones are the most stable ones are going to be lp64d so we have a you have variants with using system d or open rc depending on which in the system you want to use then we also have a glibc and muscle images so if you don't if you want to try out you know something other than glibc we also you know we allow you to do this or we try to you know offer you the choice um yeah we also got lp64 images there is also uh well let's say multi-lib image but it's more like things are not likely or things are more likely to break if you use the other the other ones but it's still available if you want to you know try it think around or just you know boot it up in a in a qem or something so risk 5 actually gentoo had a well we attempted to have a multi-lib support but when we say multi-lib it's we don't mean like running uh 32 bit binaries on 64 because we cannot do that they're independent 32 and 64 bit but we tried to have a these two abis working together lp64d and lp64 so how how this was attempted was we had a separate libdir for each for each abi so lp64 would be in lib64 slash lp64d while other one would be in lp64 but well naturally this did not go without issues of course so some problems that this actually introduced was uh well we sometimes we would have you know partially broken build systems like for example cmake so what would happen is cmake would would look for some files and it looks um it searches these files in slash let's say slash usr lib64 but then on your system you don't have this you have slash usr lib64 lp64d so then of course the whole the whole thing will crash and you're unhappy because your package doesn't build so another thing that was uh well caused problems for us was uh some important packages were only supporting uh targeting ra64 gc or lp64d abi like rust and well nowadays rust is very important if you want to have a complete complete linux distribution um so yeah just over time this this caused a lot of headaches for developers um a lot of headaches for developers which just uh you know led us to to change this and drop drop this uh drop this from our support um so nowadays so actually what this uh file what this file determines is or it sets like it sets your chost abi um your compilation flags so things that are necessary for your compiler to be able to you know correctly compile packages for your architecture and abi you are using well this is the the old profile 17.0 well this is the latest one 20.0 i'm not sure about the naming maybe it's 17.0 maybe it's related to the year that these profiles were were made because i know that we're going to have a 23.0 profiles so probably it's related with the year that they they're written but um so these are the this is what we had before when i was talking about the old profiles so we had a lp64 live there was lib64 slash lp64d so we tried to have both of these abis coexist at the same time but um it proved to be just a little too too difficult to maintain i think we're still we're still building stages with with this configuration but it's not i'm not really tested or supported so you can try it out but probably going to run into some issues what everything except gcc and glc built properly and it's a little bit different yeah yeah by the way this is Andres so i was talking about him he's the he's the main guy behind the risk five port in gen 2 yeah feel free to if i do something you miss feel free to interrupt me and add something thank you all right so repository so the main repository contains about 19 000 packages we said we we support risk five around 8 000 which doesn't mean that the other 11 000 don't build it just means that they're not you know officially tested because we try to minimize the number of packages we just because it creates additional burden for developers we have to maintain constantly these you know packages as soon as you know if there's a new version of package which pulls in different dependencies we have to you know also test you know many many dependencies which can create like a huge amount of work so that's why we try to let's say minimize for now the amount of packages we are supporting we also have a risk five overlay which is just let's say it's less official repository or more experimental which contains just some packages that are not yet ready to be in the main tree or just our working progress porting upstream like valgrind qt web engine thunderbird and so on we also have something well unofficial binary repository that is based on calculate linux so calculate is a it's a gen 2 base distribution is designed to be backwards compatible with with gen 2 and with portage so essentially it offers you just the repositories of binary packages which you can well you'll skip you'll skip the longest part of installing gen 2 so we have unofficial repository for rix five packages and there's also an image for sci-fi one matched board the last one I think was in May last year so it's not official but if you know if you're interested in using this or if you need a if you need a newer build or something you can just let us know it will be we'll try to do our best to update or whatever so yeah now what is there to be done in the future so we said that we currently support risk five as a unstable architecture we'd like to support it as a stable architecture but we'll see it depends mostly of if there will be powerful enough hardware I mean there will be at some point we just we're going to have to wait for more powerful hardware to you know to be available to us we've also thought about providing bootable images so far we do not have official bootable images we just have this minimal set of like stage three which you use to install your your distribution but if you need or if you would like to have some if you're using gen two and risk five if you want to have something like this done you can you know feel free to let us know or just your comments and thoughts what you want to have what you would like to have implemented and we'll try to do it risk 532 support so it's well risk 532 not really across linux distributions not really supported maybe debian has something but maybe more mostly usable for right now for booting in qamu but actually it took it took a bit of a time to for upstream two components to gain support for risk five so for example glibc gained support for 32b risk five in around 2021 but I believe nowadays distributions are you know busy with other problems and probably adding support for risk five and the distribution is not on their high priority and speaking of 32 bit systems there's an interesting topic theme going around now it's the infamous year 2038 problem in across 32 bit systems so there's going to be there's going to be actually talk about this today at distributions their room to 3 p.m. so anybody who's interested yet you can come and check out I think one developer from debian is going to present it's supposed to be like a discussion session between distribution developers to see how this is yeah how this should be so our team in gen 2 has been toolchain team has been working hard to you know to develop the best solution for this so yeah we'll see we'll see what other distributions have and how we can how we can maybe work together to to fix this painlessly let's say or in the least painful way what are the supported platforms or what where can you run gen 2 if you're using risk five so I've mentioned just few boards here probably the most you most mostly familiar with sci-fi boards sci-fi line matches maybe the most commonly used so far but I believe both of these sci-fi boards have been discontinued but from what I've read a couple of weeks ago they announced they announced a new board which should be should be released this summer so yeah we're going to be excited to try gen 2 on that board when it comes out what do you think is the future are there any new asics coming up that are more performant and on par with say yeah well yeah I've heard that there there have been some companies in China that are developing for more like a server grade equipment so I believe there's also a risk five laptop that's supposed to come sometime maybe this year but yeah we'll see I mean I have hopes that we're going to have a powerful hardware yeah it's just matter of time I think at this point but maybe the problem will be when it comes out probably is going to be a bit pricier so I've read some information a lot like about these laptops is going to be priced around $1500 or something so maybe not the most accessible for you know your regular Linux users but I believe yeah as the market develops we should have we should have these boards priced more reasonably or more accessible to broader audience so now we talked about supporting gen 2 we can we can see what other distributions have done in the past few years so Debian right now offers a yeah offers a full support for risk fire architecture really really good fascinating fascinating thing is that Debian actually supports yeah 95 almost 100% of packages are you're able to to install on risk five using Debian so as most other distributions they are targeting rv64 gc instruction set I believe they offer few images bootable images for some of the boards I mentioned here there was also a very good talk four years ago at Fosdam by Karsten Merker he his topic was named porting Debian to risk five and it's really a great great talk which tells the story about how what it actually takes to port one distribution or to add support for one architecture across you know Linux different toolchain components gcc glibc and so on and then ported to actual architecture so anybody who wants to know more I highly recommend you to check out check out his talk Fedora is also another another distribution that has extensive support for risk five so there have been numerous they had numerous bootstrap bootstrap phases I believe last one was in 2018 so they they officially support since 2018 they got a built a build a build a build they have a build system designed to you know produce images for risk five they they offer previewed images for virtual for booting in QEMU QEMU and then for your for physical targets there was also a talk in 2019 by David Abdu Rahmanov titled Fedora on risk five so yeah spoke about more in more details about how Fedora was bootstrapped how what it's doing right now to for support for supporting risk five well free bsd not actually Linux but it's still still good to mention because they well from what I've read there actually they released their first had their first let's say working port in January 2016 which is probably the first the first operating system that had you know bootable support for for risk five nowadays they offer they offer support for risk five as a two two architecturally support many either virtual targets or physical physical devices yeah open susan Ubuntu another another two distros which offer support for for risk five so see we have you know if you want to use Linux on risk five you really have a lot of choice depending on what what you want to do if you want to use ubuntu debby and gentoo fedora or something else desktop environments so I've just basically dumped a list of desktop environments that are all available on risk five by the way all of these are available on gentoo as well and you can also use them on risk five so whether you want whether it's GNOME KDE X FCE enlightenment whatever it's there for you to use some images of gentoo in action so yeah this is a gentoo system running with KDE desktop environment now we got also with oh this is GNOME yeah from what I see in picture GNOME enlightenment now speaking about other other mainstream applications well in the recent few years there has been really you know big progress in terms of porting these let's say widely used applications for risk five so I've just mentioned a few of these here firefox open gdk and so on LibreOffice was also also got support for risk five I believe a couple of months ago speaking of gentoo we I believe open gdk no js yes we do have with risk five support LibreOffice not yet because we are I believe there's gonna be we're waiting for next release when next release happens we're gonna we're gonna package including with the risk five support um so some projects that are still you know that are yet to be ported was actually quite difficult to find I was looking for some software that's still you know ongoing or you know work in progress it was difficult to find some because most of the stuff has already been ported but there are some some interesting projects left so like luajit, valgrind or mono I'm interestingly luajit and valgrind I believe they've also been covered and forced them maybe 2020 or 2019 so and their port is still ongoing so yeah sometimes it takes even a couple of years to to to port some some project to risk five so it's really a great success how risk five has been able to grow you know from in just a few years to to achieve the level of support that we have nowadays so that will be pretty much what I wanted to tell you I hope I've got you interested maybe in trying out gentle on risk five if you got any questions any suggestions that biggest challenges well biggest challenge is probably would be this working with these this multi-lib concept which we tried to which we tried to support for some time then we just as I explained didn't really work so we had to just drop this and focus on just supporting rv64 gc yeah this single avi which is what other distributions are also doing so we decided to do the same yeah what are your experiences with supporting GPUs on risk five some of them I believe have PCI express like the star 64 that the one 64 demo did you get any 3d acceleration to work in combination with the risk with any risk five platform already well I'm not sure I haven't tried actually don't have a physical device with PCI or with the graphics card at home so I yeah I haven't tried myself but yeah if you want I can let you know yeah give me a content yeah I have what doesn't work is anything there the navy so they've gone to you write that patch mode okay I think someone hacked it it's important for both the video on the reddit or youtube but I don't think there is the missing patch on the kernel main limit and what so she's uh are those that work with it or is it just one so she that works or is it multiple I don't know yeah that was the question in the back yeah okay there are some of these really there yeah why do you think it's worth supporting I am seeing because it doesn't it doesn't necessarily support memory protections so it's essentially I'm completely on top of the charge which one I am risk 5 64 I am seeing mostly I believe we mostly targeted to support this for mostly for you know experimentation like booting in a virtual machine but now we focus more on focus more on GC um yeah I've mentioned I've left some notes here like there's a there's our project page and gen 2 wiki pages you also have a my email or risk 5 project email so if you need anything you can just let us know if you want something something done you need a package or whatever do you need help do you have a call for action uh well yeah we always need we always need help to you know fight with various and not not only the risk 5 but in general to fight with various build issues you know patching upstreaming upstreaming patches writing documentation yeah I mentioned some stuff like bootable images so yeah we also we're always welcome to you know help if anybody's interested in contributing to either risk 5 or in general gen 2 you can just let us know and we'll be able do our best to you know help you to try to you know experience what it is to be able to contribute actively to ah yeah that one as well hangs you know we did recently found another futex issue in rb32 it may it may it may be connected to the bottom of it soon so 72 is still broken so yeah it's still everything's still rugged right now just don't know how to fix it yeah help is always welcome on all fronts yeah anybody in the room actually I know there is in the arm space there are two projects I forgot the name that are really working on optimized x86 emulation which is achieved quite impressive as results you can actually play some recent games on 64 arm and those project don't seem to show any interest in reporting this to risk 5 because a lot of would have to be done at a low level I was wondering is there any similar project ongoing right now to have like a high performance x68 x86 emulation on top of risk 5 going on because as we actually migrate to the architecture might be that would be a compelling I think maybe that has to wait when we have high performance risk 5 processes yeah we want to start early right yeah there is a higher dependency because the memory model in risk 5 is weaker in order to emulate x86 we need this PSO extension it's the same thing that apple implemented in their work right for risk 5 we're emulating x86 we need this well then I believe that that is working on that we have this extension so once we have the hardware that is capable of emulating the memory model of x86 I guess it will start out a little bit easier and do you know if that will be an official extension or just appropriate thank you I believe we have maybe one more minute thank you you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 18.36, "text": " Hi everyone, my
