{"text": " And it fails them, so everybody will be tired and wasted and then I'm here with talk, with sheets, with full of text and some really interesting policy stuff combined with some technical questions. So that's a nice way to get you all asleep and not leaving for them anymore. I'm Winfrey Tilanus, I'm privacy consultant, I'm also a member of the XMPB Standard Foundation and I'm long term and more and more also at the brink between technology and policy. So I tend to look at acts from the European Union and things like that and this act caught my eye, you may have heard about it because it also got some more news, it's a digital market act. And it has some interesting things because the European Commission can designate big companies as gatekeeper and you have to think about Meta with WhatsApp and Facebook chat, you can think about Apple's chat, about Google's chat, Instagram, maybe perhaps Telegram because it has also quite big user base with companies like that might be designated as gatekeepers. And when you're designated as gatekeeper, there's a process that will be in the second half, started in the second half of this year. After you've been designated, you have to open up your chat within three months. Two years later, you must also open up your group chat and four years later, you also must have your video and voice calling opened. And right now in the start, it's okay to open it by just publishing an API. But the European Commission in all its wisdom may decide to draft a standard for interoperability and if they do so, then all these, the own API won't suffice anymore, then you have to follow that standard. And they also said that standard has to be drafted by European standards organization, so it has to be the Zen or the Etsy. Also interesting, there's some more nice things about it because that API or that standard has missed have the same security features as the own product of the company and it must be neutral, so it must not be crippled in such a way that nobody wants to use it or that I have some conditions to it that really puts it backwards compared to the own product. Well, I read this and I had a deja vu. Because some years ago, the Dutch Ministry of Health had a problem with interoperable and secure chat. So they asked for a standard about chat to make it interoperable and secure. And they gave the assignment to the NEN that's the Standardization Institute and I happened to be chairing the working group drafting that standard. So I went in all kind of things and questions and things that happened there. So I thought why not combine my two experiences of this experience with what the European Commission is aiming at and let's have a look on what we're dealing with. Now, when I think about the European Commission, it's about the question, what do you mean by secure? Fender A says we are secure because we offer the best end-to-end encryption in the world. Nobody can eavesdrop. This is the most secure solution you have. Fender B says, nah, we monitor all communications and filter all harm for content. Well everybody is safe on this platform. This, well, tell me, well, let's put your hands, would you think A is the most secure one? We think B is the most secure one? Nobody. But this, even the European Commission is sometimes aiming at security like B. So there's a big misunderstanding about what do you mean by secure. And it's kind of difficult to add A to B, isn't it? And end-to-end encryption does have its drawbacks because both clients must support the same end-to-end protocol. So you can't have one do end-to-end encryption based on the matrix or open PGP and the other one an open WISP or something like that. It must be the same and there's all the key exchange and everything. And spam detection, harmful content detection, we may like it or we may not like it. It is a thing and it is an important part of the security model of some platforms. And there's also one interesting thing that I saw about, well, nice end-to-end encrypted platform opens up with a nice API. So I can connect to that API. That API is also end-to-end encrypted. Before it was open, they had their own clients that sent and received the message. So they knew what was injected into the network. And it was in such a way that nothing went wrong when it was received by the client. But now I can write my own client, maybe even a first-in-client or something like that, and inject whatever I want into the network. So they may even get a security risk because they can't monitor, can't filter out all the nice attacks I inject into the network. So that might be quite interesting. And end-to-end encrypted may also have intellectual property issues. When there's some propriety encryption protocol that a vendor boards a nice license to, like what's apt-it, then they may say, well, here's the API. This is the protocol. And if you want to use it by your own license, well, that's an interesting business case for Maximali Spike. So there's quite a bit of issues of already one's being secure. Oh, that was going too fast. What's really important here to understand, this is a political decision. The European Commission must say what they mean with secure and how end-to-end encryption would fit in that picture. If they don't and try to push it to a standardization organization, then it will be mayhem. And I can tell from my own experience, I can also reveal the standardization project in the Netherlands failed because they didn't define what they meant by secure. So, but if it did come up with a standard in the Netherlands, it was for health care. So it is quite a specific use case. We standardized to secured servers. So the premise was that when a health care organization sets up a certain server or buys a certain sales server offer, that server was meant for this job and secured in a proper level. No end-to-end encryption because some of them had a security model that relied on securing the data on the server and not keeping anything on the client. And the whole network between the whole health care providers would be authorized, it won't be an open network. And exactly that last point was where the project was killed because some vendors wanted to have another direction there. And then the next question is, when you say interoperable, interoperable with who? When you publish an API, is it sufficient to publish an API so a client can connect? You said, nobody knows, European Commission didn't say anything here. Maybe when you read the law quite close, this is maybe not exactly what they meant, but they're not really clear about it. It would also mean that when you write a chat client, it would be interoperable with all vendors that it needs to implement all those APIs. Or is it, like we did in health care, is this a server-to-server with limited parties? So a walled garden of some systems that are interoperable with each other, or is it really open federation, server-to-server for whoever sets up a server and connects to it? No idea. But it's quite hard to start standardization process if you don't have any idea about what's happening here. And, oh, I'm good in time. Then there are the big question about functionalities because chat isn't just chat. You know, when you look at whatever chat clients you use, you have all nifty features starting with slash me and then repeating your, this is your own nickname, up to all kinds of fancy stickers being sent around of emoji you can add to message and things like that, there are lots of functionalities that a chat can have. And certainly when you enter into encryption, they can't have the server in between translated or say, well, I handle this and this way, that must then all be done by the clients. And that means that for all of these functionalities, you must make a choice about how you're going to handle it. Is this an obligatory functionality that must be part of the protocol that must be implemented then by all the clients or is it optional and making a functionality optional means that you need to have something like service discovery or do you say, no, this is not part of the standard and you don't have to be interoperable for this functionality. Well, we're talking about, about what kind of functionality it is. Almost, I did, I did leave things out mainly because for example, like service discovery, certain ways of connecting, how you standardize exactly the connection. I guess that's in the upper layer and not on the functionality layer you have to choose. But this is the kind of things you're talking about when you start standardizing this. And I have nice time to discuss some of them. When you look at attaching an emoji to a message, well, you think emoji, that's part of the UTF-8 character set, so you can just say, this is the message and then put this emoji to it. But some clients don't, just don't support all kind of emojis, either in sending or receiving. They have only limited set of emoji you can attach to a message. And also, to get something like that done, you maybe need some services discovery to check what emoji are available at the other client and then you can tell your client these are the emoji you can send. Or maybe you just sent an emoji and notice it doesn't work. Not really the best way of interoperability. And then there's also something like, oh, no, that was the wrong one. I need to tap another one, so you need to correct that one or delete it from this. It was inappropriate to do this, so let's get it out. So when you start looking at attaching an emoji to a message, it just looks like a quite straightforward functionality. When you start thinking through an interoperability context, then it might be quite interesting, quite a nice thing. I also like to move notification when you send a message to somebody on platform A, that you can get a response back, no, I'm now somewhere else on a different account on the same platform or maybe on a different account on a totally different platform. It's a nice one to standardize, maybe. I don't know if all platforms would like that and if they'd like to cripple that one or not. Well, I'll just, one minute. Yeah, it's great, is there one other one maybe I should talk about or should we just go straight on to the questions. So thank you. So, first in the back, that was the first and that was it. The question is when is a party designated as gatekeeper and there's a whole set of rules and it mainly means that you have a big market share, a big turnover on it one way or the other, either on advertising or on this paying customers and it looks really like the list I mentioned at the beginning will be the list that will be designated and others not. But you really have to be very large and be one of the biggest players in the fields to get that nice status. You mentioned that the Dutch initiative failed because what was meant with security was not defined, but why didn't somebody in the group say, okay, we're going to define security like this and go ahead? Well, I did. Oh, yeah, I should repeat. So the question is why didn't somebody in the Dutch group define security and just go ahead? Well, I did. And that was exactly the moment that it failed. Yeah, that is a lesson indeed. The issue was really from a commercial perspective, there were some vendors on the table that had different reasons to say, well, I don't want this definition of security. And they made a big mess. I wasn't really prepared for that meeting that I really was totally furthered by one vendor. There was all kind of confusion raised in the group. And then we needed to do some new cycles about how to get out of this. And that was the moment that the government said, well, this takes too long, we're gone. Well, the start of the problem was they didn't define what security is. So lesson learned. And I think it's a very good question because we should do the same trick of be careful for the same issue and maybe be clear to the European Commission, tell us what you mean by secure. We can't standardize if you don't tell us. Yeah, I saw two fingers there were probably basically saying, so my question was, did somebody ask and he said, the problem with asking is that they might actually tell you and they might actually tell you at least if they don't tell you, we can dream a little bit that it might be a. The point is, in most standardization situations, you have a bunch of vendors who are intrinsically motivated to cooperate and to work together. And then they can discuss nicely about the good questions. Standardization like this is with vendors we don't want to. And that's a big, also a big issue when you push this to a standardization organization because they're not up to it. But if you're sitting there with vendors we don't want to, they will blow up the process. So the only way to avoid that is to make sure that somebody sets the limits, makes clear you have to do it this way and otherwise you can leave the table but you will still have a stump that you have to adhere to.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 12.24, "text": " And it fails them, so everybody will be tired and wasted and then I'm here with talk, with", "tokens": [50364,
