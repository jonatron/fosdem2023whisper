00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
I'm going to talk today about MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.10.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.840
Original talk says 10.11,

00:12.840 --> 00:14.880
but I wanted to make sure we're sticking to

00:14.880 --> 00:17.920
the latest GA or stable version,

00:17.920 --> 00:22.000
so it had to go down a bit.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.780
Let me start by congratulating

00:26.780 --> 00:31.720
MariaDB team with MariaDB Corporation going public.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.500
In particular, Monty,

00:33.500 --> 00:39.320
congrats to driving two very impactful open-source database

00:39.320 --> 00:43.680
companies to exit that's quite an achievement.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.280
I think you people in the universe have that.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.520
Just one step and you're done.

00:51.400 --> 00:56.280
Yeah. Well, so what are we going to talk about?

00:56.280 --> 00:58.980
First, I think which we need to recognize,

00:58.980 --> 01:05.120
where MariaDB and MySQL started from the same roots,

01:05.120 --> 01:09.240
we have diverged substantially.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.720
So I think it was interesting when on the previous talk,

01:12.720 --> 01:15.240
Jean-FranÃ§ois was talking about upstream,

01:15.240 --> 01:16.680
I was thinking, hey, you know what,

01:16.680 --> 01:21.360
does MariaDB really considers MySQL upstream at this point?

01:21.360 --> 01:25.680
Or not quite, right in this case.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.880
I think there is enough diversity right,

01:28.880 --> 01:32.000
what this is our ancestors,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
maybe like monkeys for humans,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.800
something of this regard.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.440
Now, in this case,

01:40.440 --> 01:46.880
I am trying to be fair the best way I can,

01:46.880 --> 01:51.840
which for me always means offense everybody equally.

01:51.840 --> 01:56.280
So if Monty is not screaming at me saying,

01:56.280 --> 01:58.080
you are fucking moron, Peter,

01:58.080 --> 01:59.480
that is not how it is,

01:59.480 --> 02:02.280
then probably I'm not doing my job properly.

02:02.280 --> 02:05.360
No, no, no.

02:05.360 --> 02:11.280
Oh, you see? Yes, yes, yes.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.400
Of course, of course.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.680
You always do everything with loving your heart,

02:15.680 --> 02:19.200
and you don't use bad words as I do.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.880
That is wonderful.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.480
So let's talk about development model first.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.800
Obviously, MySQL is developed by the Oracle corporations.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.040
We can see what the contributions are accepted,

02:31.040 --> 02:34.000
but I wouldn't say they're encouraged in the same way

02:34.000 --> 02:35.760
as MariaDB does,

02:35.760 --> 02:37.960
and we also have open source,

02:37.960 --> 02:40.200
as I would say, like a drop ship open source, right?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.440
We have those release coming,

02:41.440 --> 02:43.800
but we do not really have a tree there,

02:43.800 --> 02:49.120
all their developers changes right happen as we can see.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.080
That are the things that can be particularly problematic,

02:51.080 --> 02:53.320
for example, for security bugs,

02:53.320 --> 02:55.320
where it can be hard to track,

02:55.320 --> 03:01.440
like what exactly change fixes that particular issue, right?

03:01.440 --> 03:03.720
Which is different from MariaDB,

03:03.720 --> 03:08.760
which has a server released by MariaDB Foundation,

03:08.760 --> 03:11.720
though there is a lot of work, right,

03:11.720 --> 03:16.920
for actual new features done by MariaDB corporations.

03:16.920 --> 03:21.240
Though foundations ensure what the contributions are encouraged

03:21.240 --> 03:24.560
and developers really done in the public, right,

03:24.560 --> 03:29.360
as I would say, true open source project.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.720
One thing I wanted to point out,

03:31.720 --> 03:33.320
which I think is interesting,

03:33.320 --> 03:36.600
is also changes from the Oracle side, right?

03:36.600 --> 03:42.200
For years, I've been actually defender of Oracle

03:42.200 --> 03:43.480
in regards to, hey, you know,

03:43.480 --> 03:45.000
besides all this kind of stuff

03:45.000 --> 03:47.600
that Oracle is looking to kill MySQL,

03:47.600 --> 03:50.400
they have actually been doing a pretty good job

03:50.400 --> 03:53.800
in releasing majority features of the open source

03:53.800 --> 03:55.840
and their proprietary enterprise features

03:55.840 --> 03:59.720
have been kind of well-isolated, abstracted through API,

03:59.720 --> 04:02.800
and it was relatively easy for companies as well,

04:02.800 --> 04:06.760
especially, like, per corner, to implement the equivalent.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.200
Now things have been changing in the last couple of years, right?

04:09.200 --> 04:12.400
We can see what, everybody knows this guy?

04:12.400 --> 04:17.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, like,

04:17.600 --> 04:21.400
we can see what Larry actually discovered,

04:21.400 --> 04:27.400
what the MySQL exists in the last couple of years, right?

04:27.400 --> 04:32.000
And he only seems to care about MySQL as a heat wave,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.360
because we all know heat wave

04:33.360 --> 04:36.920
supports the melt zone of lake, right?

04:36.920 --> 04:40.800
And we can see a lot of focus getting on this

04:40.800 --> 04:44.560
snowflake development, which is sort of a cloud-only,

04:44.560 --> 04:45.920
and of course, you know,

04:45.920 --> 04:48.560
proprietary version of MySQL.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.080
So far, it is only analytic extension, right?

04:52.080 --> 04:53.680
But I think it's all questions to us,

04:53.680 --> 04:56.560
hey, could there be some other critical features

04:56.560 --> 04:58.120
which will be only property, right?

04:58.120 --> 05:01.000
Maybe Oracle somewhere in the bellies

05:01.000 --> 05:03.560
developing something like transparent sharding for MySQL,

05:03.560 --> 05:06.080
maybe that is going to be proprietary first, right?

05:06.080 --> 05:07.320
So that is, I think, a question

05:07.320 --> 05:13.440
that's what a lot of people in MySQL community are asking.

05:13.440 --> 05:17.240
Now, with MySQL, with MariaDB,

05:17.240 --> 05:21.280
I think what is interesting compared to, like,

05:21.280 --> 05:23.840
MySQL, there are actually two companies,

05:23.840 --> 05:27.880
MyDB, well, two entities, probably better word,

05:27.880 --> 05:32.960
MariaDB Foundation and MariaDB Corporation, right?

05:32.960 --> 05:35.320
That is the latest mission,

05:35.320 --> 05:37.080
which I just grabbed a couple of days ago

05:37.080 --> 05:43.160
from MariaDB Foundation side, right?

05:43.160 --> 05:46.720
And I think that is very good to understand relationship

05:46.720 --> 05:52.920
with those companies to understand this, right?

05:52.920 --> 05:55.280
Now, if you think in this case is what MariaDBation

05:55.280 --> 05:57.320
is really, at large,

05:57.320 --> 06:01.360
focusing on serving MariaDB community,

06:01.360 --> 06:03.200
MariaDB ecosystem, right?

06:03.200 --> 06:06.840
It develops open source software around MySQL.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.200
MariaDB Corporation, that is now public company, right?

06:10.200 --> 06:13.400
Which is providing the proprietary solutions

06:13.400 --> 06:16.480
and commercializing MariaDB software, right?

06:16.480 --> 06:21.000
That is, I think, is the interest, right?

06:21.000 --> 06:25.160
Now, relationship sometimes can be a little bit complicated,

06:25.160 --> 06:27.240
though I would say there have been

06:27.240 --> 06:29.640
some more complicated entitlements,

06:29.640 --> 06:31.960
in which I mentioned in my previous talks, right?

06:31.960 --> 06:36.000
And some of them have been made more clear,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.080
which I think is a great progress.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.280
So, if you think about this, what is interesting

06:41.280 --> 06:44.480
is MariaDB Foundation has responsibility,

06:44.480 --> 06:48.160
kind of, relatively narrow to the MariaDB server, right?

06:48.160 --> 06:50.120
And we can see what number of other components,

06:50.120 --> 06:54.480
which are very valuable in MySQL ecosystem,

06:54.480 --> 06:57.840
are owned by MariaDB Corporation, right?

06:57.840 --> 07:03.360
Not by the foundation and also a lot of development.

07:03.360 --> 07:08.080
Roadmap is driven by the corporation.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.400
I also find it interesting what we see in MySQL,

07:10.400 --> 07:13.720
Knowledgebase, which is kind of built by a community,

07:13.720 --> 07:17.600
but is hosted by MariaDB Corporation.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.600
I find, not in a very good sense, for like an open source,

07:21.600 --> 07:25.880
a software is also entanglement on a website level, right?

07:25.880 --> 07:30.880
So, if I am downloading MariaDB software from.org,

07:30.880 --> 07:34.880
then I am kind of redirected next

07:34.880 --> 07:38.880
to the MariaDB Corporation Knowledgebase, right?

07:38.880 --> 07:41.880
And encouraged to fill out the lead,

07:41.880 --> 07:44.880
which will go to the MariaDB Corporation,

07:44.880 --> 07:46.880
which is not totally transparent, right?

07:46.880 --> 07:49.880
I think that's kind of, I may be still looking like,

07:49.880 --> 07:52.880
oh, I am engaging with a non-profit while actually

07:52.880 --> 07:59.880
I am giving my connections to somewhere else.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.880
Now, I wouldn't say, though, that that is completely unfair

08:03.880 --> 08:07.880
in this case, because MariaDB does carry the largest,

08:07.880 --> 08:10.880
well, way to development and promote in MariaDB, right?

08:10.880 --> 08:14.880
And they do also get the largest rewards

08:14.880 --> 08:19.880
compared to the other sponsors of MariaDB Foundation.

08:21.880 --> 08:25.880
Now, let's look quickly at what is really open source

08:25.880 --> 08:27.880
between those versions.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.880
Right now, in MySQL, what we can see,

08:30.880 --> 08:34.880
it's a very clear open core platform,

08:34.880 --> 08:39.880
and we have Maria MySQL community, right?

08:39.880 --> 08:44.880
And, you know, router, cluster, wherever all that comes,

08:44.880 --> 08:47.880
which comes in open source edition,

08:47.880 --> 08:50.880
and there is also enterprise version.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.880
Plus, as I mentioned, additionally,

08:52.880 --> 08:55.880
we have increasing focus on the cloud-only solution

08:55.880 --> 09:00.880
as a heat wave.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.880
In terms of MariaDB, there are, you know,

09:04.880 --> 09:07.880
a lot more nuance in this case, right?

09:07.880 --> 09:12.880
Because there are certain things coming from MariaDB Foundation,

09:12.880 --> 09:15.880
which are completely open source right now.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.880
The things in MariaDB Corporation space

09:18.880 --> 09:25.880
they can be with a variety of licenses.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.880
Now, if you look at the...

09:27.880 --> 09:30.880
Peter, let's correct your mistakes.

09:33.880 --> 09:34.880
Okay.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.880
Max-K, all the versions are open source.

09:36.880 --> 09:37.880
What say?

09:37.880 --> 09:41.880
You need to say that all the versions of Max-K are open source.

09:41.880 --> 09:42.880
Yes, yeah.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.880
The latest is BSL.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.880
Well, okay, yes.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.880
So, the latest version of Max-K is BSL.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.880
All the versions are open source, buggy, insecure,

09:54.880 --> 09:56.880
and unsupported, right?

09:56.880 --> 10:00.880
What?

10:00.880 --> 10:03.880
Let me just...

10:03.880 --> 10:04.880
What say?

10:04.880 --> 10:06.880
You need to say bugs and you support them.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.880
You can get support contracts with them

10:08.880 --> 10:11.880
as you can get for all the things in Python.

10:11.880 --> 10:12.880
No difference.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.880
Well, okay, well, you see...

10:16.880 --> 10:17.880
What do you think it's like?

10:17.880 --> 10:18.880
No, no.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.880
I miss hot backup.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.880
What say?

10:20.880 --> 10:23.880
I miss hot backup in the...

10:23.880 --> 10:26.880
Maria backup versus MySQL, whatever.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.880
Okay.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.880
Not open source at all.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.880
Okay.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.880
That's...

10:33.880 --> 10:36.880
Yeah, that's fair.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.880
Okay.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.880
Let's move on, right?

10:41.880 --> 10:46.880
But I would actually check on the Max scale

10:46.880 --> 10:48.880
in terms of how much changes there are.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.880
I did check a couple of years ago, right,

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
to be honest, right?

10:51.880 --> 10:53.880
And the old versions at that time,

10:53.880 --> 10:55.880
they really converted to abandoned there.

10:55.880 --> 10:56.880
Maybe that changed, right?

10:56.880 --> 11:00.880
And there is actually, you know,

11:00.880 --> 11:03.880
they are being maintained beyond the BSL cutoff.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.880
Maybe not.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.880
Okay.

11:07.880 --> 11:08.880
The next thing, right?

11:08.880 --> 11:11.880
If you look at the MySQL enterprise,

11:11.880 --> 11:14.880
it's a superset of community, right?

11:14.880 --> 11:16.880
And I think in this case, you have everything

11:16.880 --> 11:19.880
that runs in community, runs on enterprise.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.880
With MariaDB, you can see MariaDB Enterprise

11:23.880 --> 11:26.880
is an extended subset of community,

11:26.880 --> 11:28.880
meaning there are some things in...

11:28.880 --> 11:29.880
which exist in community,

11:29.880 --> 11:32.880
which has not been included.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.880
Everything we do for enterprise is part of the community.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.880
There are only two small features that this enterprise

11:38.880 --> 11:39.880
we don't know.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.880
Well, I mean, so all the storage engines

11:42.880 --> 11:44.880
which exist in community are also supported

11:44.880 --> 11:46.880
under enterprise agreements?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.880
Well, that's what I'm saying, right?

11:48.880 --> 11:49.880
I'm saying the first sentence.

11:49.880 --> 11:50.880
What?

11:50.880 --> 11:52.880
This is not a really extended subset.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.880
It has two features.

11:54.880 --> 12:00.880
Well, what about expand?

12:00.880 --> 12:04.880
It's not part of MariaDB Enterprise anymore.

12:04.880 --> 12:05.880
It's a different project.

12:05.880 --> 12:06.880
Oh, okay.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.880
Okay, okay, let me correct.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.880
So there is a cool feature available

12:12.880 --> 12:15.880
from MariaDB Corporation,

12:15.880 --> 12:18.880
but it's not part of MariaDB Enterprise product anymore.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.880
Okay, good.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.880
Okay, sounds good.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.880
Okay, let me move faster,

12:27.880 --> 12:30.880
or we will need much more time

12:30.880 --> 12:33.880
if you have a wonderful and productive discussion with Monty.

12:33.880 --> 12:40.880
Okay, so now in terms of cloud native,

12:40.880 --> 12:42.880
we have a finding new MySQL operator

12:42.880 --> 12:45.880
available from Oracle and both for MySQL

12:45.880 --> 12:47.880
and MariaDB, there is also a bunch of third-party

12:47.880 --> 12:50.880
operators available, including one for MySQL

12:50.880 --> 12:53.880
from per corner.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.880
If you look at from MariaDB Corporation,

12:55.880 --> 12:57.880
there is a lot of focus on SkySQL as a way

12:57.880 --> 13:01.880
to run MariaDB in the clouds, right?

13:01.880 --> 13:05.880
Like there was MariaDB Corporation operator ones, right?

13:05.880 --> 13:09.880
But that is nowhere to be found,

13:09.880 --> 13:11.880
but there is an effort for MariaDB Foundation

13:11.880 --> 13:18.880
to have their operator created

13:18.880 --> 13:22.880
though I couldn't find what if that's GA yet.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.880
Database as a service, right?

13:24.880 --> 13:26.880
Obviously, there is a lot of databases

13:26.880 --> 13:34.880
as a service available for both databases standpoint, right?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.880
In this case, I think what is also interesting

13:36.880 --> 13:38.880
is what a lot of folks rely on

13:38.880 --> 13:41.880
with sort of community versions right there.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.880
You would say Oracle has MySQL Enterprise

13:45.880 --> 13:48.880
with HitWave available on Oracle Cloud

13:48.880 --> 13:50.880
and now increasingly some other clouds

13:50.880 --> 13:53.880
and also MariaDB has partnerships

13:53.880 --> 13:57.880
with other set of folks.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.880
In terms of analytics, we have a column store, right?

14:01.880 --> 14:04.880
In MariaDB ecosystem, right?

14:04.880 --> 14:07.880
In MySQL ecosystem, right?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.880
There is no really integrated open-source solution.

14:10.880 --> 14:18.880
We have only cloud, only HitWave as I mentioned.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.880
I also think there is a significantly different focus

14:20.880 --> 14:27.880
between MariaDB and MySQL, right?

14:27.880 --> 14:31.880
I'm not going to read through all of that,

14:31.880 --> 14:33.880
but I think it's also interesting

14:33.880 --> 14:38.880
what the architecture approach has been substantially different, right?

14:38.880 --> 14:40.880
If you look at MariaDB,

14:40.880 --> 14:44.880
it has been really having much more incremental

14:44.880 --> 14:46.880
iterative approach, right?

14:46.880 --> 14:51.880
In terms of MySQL, you can say a very big change

14:51.880 --> 14:57.880
if MySQL 8, where a lot of things has been written,

14:57.880 --> 15:01.880
made not quite comparable,

15:01.880 --> 15:03.880
and also there is also a lot of focus in MySQL,

15:03.880 --> 15:07.880
making it work better in the cloud, right,

15:07.880 --> 15:11.880
in how Oracle sees operating database in their cloud.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.880
Release frequency, that is something

15:13.880 --> 15:16.880
which I think is very interesting, which changed

15:16.880 --> 15:19.880
from the last year, right?

15:19.880 --> 15:23.880
Where we can see MariaDB recently moved

15:23.880 --> 15:26.880
to even more frequent releases, right?

15:26.880 --> 15:30.880
Well, which are with shorter maintenance cycle, right,

15:30.880 --> 15:33.880
as well as LTS releases every two years, right?

15:33.880 --> 15:37.880
So we can see what's starting with the February last year,

15:37.880 --> 15:42.880
the major MariaDB releases are coming out as quickly

15:42.880 --> 15:47.880
as minor MySQL releases, right?

15:47.880 --> 15:52.880
So I think that is a very interesting difference

15:52.880 --> 15:55.880
in this case, right?

15:55.880 --> 16:02.880
And as I mentioned, there are quite a few differences

16:02.880 --> 16:04.880
in this case, right?

16:04.880 --> 16:08.880
With MySQL 8, it kind of has this evergreen release, right,

16:08.880 --> 16:10.880
where you have a lot of features introduced

16:10.880 --> 16:14.880
in Maria releases, also a lot of bugs, right?

16:14.880 --> 16:16.880
In particular, I think in the last few releases

16:16.880 --> 16:20.880
there have been some, you know, pretty nasty corruption bugs,

16:20.880 --> 16:22.880
which people did not appreciate.

16:22.880 --> 16:28.880
And also this concept of now it's only forward compatibility,

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
right?

16:29.880 --> 16:32.880
Once you move to the new MySQL 8 release, right,

16:32.880 --> 16:37.880
you are not going to be able to run a previous version, right?

16:37.880 --> 16:40.880
So if you really want a safe rollback,

16:40.880 --> 16:44.880
you need to dump and restore, which is not appreciated by many.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.880
You missed the major point from MariaDB,

16:46.880 --> 16:49.880
upgrade from any new version to any newer version.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.880
You don't need to go between intermediate version.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.880
That's a big change to compare to MySQL.

16:54.880 --> 16:59.880
So what you can do from, let's say, 10.5 to 10.10, right?

16:59.880 --> 17:02.880
You can go from 5.2 to 11.

17:02.880 --> 17:03.880
I see.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.880
So you can upgrade.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.880
That is a good thing to make sure that you have clean setup.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.880
That's the only thing that matters.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.880
I just made 5.7 MySQL to MariaDB 10.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.880
I think 10.10 also in one step.

17:20.880 --> 17:21.880
OK.

17:21.880 --> 17:28.880
Well, yeah, let's move quickly, right?

17:28.880 --> 17:32.880
So some of the changes in MariaDB in MySQL,

17:32.880 --> 17:34.880
which I think is worth it.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.880
One is like a protocol.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.880
MySQL hasn't pushing a lot on their new X protocol,

17:40.880 --> 17:46.880
while MariaDB has been making classical protocol better.

17:46.880 --> 17:51.880
We also have different interfaces support right there.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.880
Well, something else, Manchi?

17:53.880 --> 17:56.880
I just want to know how much do you see uses of X protocol?

17:56.880 --> 17:59.880
Personally, I would say almost non-users.

17:59.880 --> 18:00.880
Well, yeah.

18:00.880 --> 18:05.880
It's used for group replication configuration.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.880
If you manage group replication configuration, you use it.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.880
Interesting.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.880
Everything else?

18:13.880 --> 18:14.880
Sorry, I have to restart the focus.

18:14.880 --> 18:15.880
Sorry.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.880
You're going to lose slides for a minute.

18:17.880 --> 18:18.880
Oh, OK.

18:18.880 --> 18:19.880
OK.

18:19.880 --> 18:20.880
Yes.

18:20.880 --> 18:35.880
The box needs to be ready.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.880
Yeah.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.880
Well, anyway, do you guys have a good generation?

18:40.880 --> 18:43.880
Yes, OK.

18:43.880 --> 18:47.880
So, Jason, imagine Jason.

18:47.880 --> 18:53.880
Can you all imagine Jason?

18:53.880 --> 18:54.880
Yeah.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.880
So, that is very significant difference.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.880
It also exists in MySQL.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.880
They designed native JSON data type, right,

19:03.880 --> 19:08.880
and have some pretty cool things like a partial updates,

19:08.880 --> 19:10.880
and also, I think, from usability standpoint,

19:10.880 --> 19:17.880
Jason shortcuts, which makes things nicer and cleaner.

19:17.880 --> 19:24.880
With MariaDB, the JSON is really stored as a text,

19:24.880 --> 19:30.880
where it has improved the JSON partial speed significantly.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.880
And what is cool in the latest MySQL versions,

19:33.880 --> 19:36.880
it cut up a lot in JSON features in MySQL.

19:36.880 --> 19:40.880
Like, I think, like two years ago, I could say, hey,

19:40.880 --> 19:43.880
MySQL is a lot further in terms of what it can do with JSON.

19:43.880 --> 19:47.880
Most of that gap has been covered.

19:47.880 --> 19:53.880
Now, imagine replication.

19:53.880 --> 20:01.880
Well, that is also, there are things substantially different.

20:01.880 --> 20:06.880
MySQL has built out a group replication,

20:06.880 --> 20:11.880
which gets a lot of focus in MySQL 8,

20:11.880 --> 20:15.880
specifically with MySQL in a DB cluster.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.880
You now have a kind of cluster set,

20:17.880 --> 20:20.880
like how you can replicate between two clusters,

20:20.880 --> 20:22.880
a lot of focus on that.

20:22.880 --> 20:29.880
MariaDB has been focusing on both supporting classical replication

20:29.880 --> 20:33.880
as well as Galera replication.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.880
And also, even if you look at classical replication,

20:36.880 --> 20:42.880
MariaDB GTID and MySQL GTIDs are conceptually different, right?

20:42.880 --> 20:47.880
They are both moved to that versus binary logs alone.

20:47.880 --> 20:53.880
Okay, well, you want me to try?

20:53.880 --> 20:59.880
One minute.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.880
One minute, yeah.

21:02.880 --> 21:03.880
One minute.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.880
Minus one minute, right now, okay.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.880
What? You broke it.

21:07.880 --> 21:11.880
Now, it doesn't work at all.

21:11.880 --> 21:15.880
You see, you see.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.880
I think it's seen something, but it doesn't see.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.880
Okay.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.880
The good news is you can't tell me.

21:21.880 --> 21:22.880
What?

21:22.880 --> 21:25.880
Good news, you can't blame me.

21:25.880 --> 21:31.880
Four change for once in a lifetime.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.880
Can you see the external display?

21:33.880 --> 21:34.880
Well, yeah, I mean, I think as you see,

21:34.880 --> 21:35.880
it's kind of blinks, right?

21:35.880 --> 21:39.880
What it gets, the external display, right?

21:39.880 --> 21:43.880
Like, hello, you see, it gets.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.880
Yeah, that's what it says it's seeing external display.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.880
That's lovely.

21:49.880 --> 21:53.880
Well, look, I mean, I have a couple of slides in minus two minutes,

21:53.880 --> 21:55.880
so let me just finish.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.880
And then you can, you know,

21:57.880 --> 22:00.880
troubleshoot during the lunch, right?

22:00.880 --> 22:05.880
Yeah, so, okay, let's see what else.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.880
A couple of things which are different, right, significantly.

22:08.880 --> 22:14.880
I would say is, A, security is very different, right?

22:14.880 --> 22:18.880
There have been a lot of approach to making security better,

22:18.880 --> 22:20.880
both in my school and MariaDB,

22:20.880 --> 22:21.880
but approaches are essentially different.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.880
So if that is area you focus on

22:23.880 --> 22:25.880
and you're migrating one way on the river,

22:25.880 --> 22:28.880
make sure you give it separate special attention.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.880
Optimizer is another area, right,

22:30.880 --> 22:33.880
which things diverted specifically, right?

22:33.880 --> 22:37.880
So, again, make sure to check a query plan,

22:37.880 --> 22:39.880
especially for complicated queries,

22:39.880 --> 22:45.880
go in one way or another, right?

22:45.880 --> 22:49.880
Now, I wanted to also pick up in the latest release

22:49.880 --> 22:52.880
a couple of unique MariaDB goodness,

22:52.880 --> 22:54.880
which speak to me in particular, right?

22:54.880 --> 22:58.880
One is, I like your ID data type, right?

22:58.880 --> 23:01.880
Because all that kind of from my school, post,

23:01.880 --> 23:03.880
well, you know what, you can actually do this

23:03.880 --> 23:06.880
and then you're going to store your ID efficiently.

23:06.880 --> 23:07.880
That is not a good way.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.880
You know, just provide the user convenient

23:09.880 --> 23:11.880
your ID data type and functions, right?

23:11.880 --> 23:15.880
And so we don't have to deal with that shit.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.880
Log-free Altitable for replication,

23:17.880 --> 23:19.880
I think it's also very cool, right?

23:19.880 --> 23:24.880
Paying double for essentially time for Altitable.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.880
That is, I think was long problem in iSchool.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.880
Great, that's fixed.

23:30.880 --> 23:34.880
And I also like this concept of grant to public concept,

23:34.880 --> 23:39.880
which is being added in 10.11.

23:39.880 --> 23:44.880
Okay, and now, I want you to imagine mountains.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.880
Well, because this slide was supposed to show

23:48.880 --> 23:50.880
what there's a nice conference

23:50.880 --> 23:52.880
covering a whole bunch of databases

23:52.880 --> 23:55.880
called Percona Live coming in May.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.880
It will be in Denver, right?

23:58.880 --> 24:01.880
So, and call for papers is open.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.880
We want, you know, if you have something to talk,

24:04.880 --> 24:06.880
please submit.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.880
Also, some other unique opportunity, right?

24:09.880 --> 24:12.880
Some of you are probably running MariaDB, right?

24:12.880 --> 24:14.880
Anyone? Anyone? Okay, well,

24:14.880 --> 24:17.880
this is your opportunity not to just run MariaDB,

24:17.880 --> 24:19.880
but run for MariaDB.

24:19.880 --> 24:23.880
We will put together like relay team for the Denver Marathon,

24:23.880 --> 24:27.880
right, which will take place one day before,

24:27.880 --> 24:29.880
before Percona Live, right?

24:29.880 --> 24:32.880
And so if you guys want to attend

24:32.880 --> 24:35.880
and run about 8K as a part of MariaDB team,

24:35.880 --> 24:37.880
let me know.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.880
That's all I have to say,

24:39.880 --> 24:41.880
and you should imagine this slide,

24:41.880 --> 24:43.880
which says thanks to all of you

24:43.880 --> 24:45.880
for being such a wonderful audience

24:45.880 --> 24:47.880
and coming to listen to my talk.

24:47.880 --> 25:06.880
Thank you.
