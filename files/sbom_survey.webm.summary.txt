The talk presented at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 focused on software bill of materials (S-BOMs) and their importance in open source dependency management security. The speakers conducted a case study using different S-BOM generators on an open source solution to examine their agreement, comparability, and changes over time. They found that tools integrated into the dependency manager worked better than generic tools, and highlighted the need for S-BOMs to include more contextual information such as call graphs and code-level details. The speakers concluded by advocating for a standardized S-BOM format and the creation of an independent S-BOM benchmark to assess the accuracy of generated S-BOMs.
