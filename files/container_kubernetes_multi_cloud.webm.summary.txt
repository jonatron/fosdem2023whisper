The speaker, Marco Mancini of OpenNebula, presented a talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 about deploying Kubernetes clusters on hybrid and multi-cloud environments using their open-source solution. OpenNebula was created as a solution for private cloud computing, but has evolved to help manage different types of workloads, from virtual machines to Kubernetes clusters. Their open-source solution allows for automatic provisioning of resources across multiple cloud providers and includes a tool called One Provision for creating edge clusters, a marketplace for deploying appliances and Docker images, and an appliance called One Key for deploying Kubernetes clusters. The speaker demonstrated how to use One Provision to create clusters on AWS and Equinix, and how to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters using OpenNebula's solution.
