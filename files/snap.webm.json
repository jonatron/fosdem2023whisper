{"text": " Okay, so hi everyone. Awesome that you're all here. I'm Jadka, this is Jens and we will now present SNAP, a programming language that we work on together with Bernat and a few other people that I'll mention in a second. And what we want to do with you today, or what you have to listen to, is first I'll explain shortly what SNAP is and why we care about it. Then we'll show our three guiding principles and if we have time in the end, Jens will show what's under the hood of SNAP as well. Okay, so SNAP is a visual block space programming language and I'll show you that to you in a second. It's also like MicroBlocks Live and Parallel and we develop it together with people at UC Berkeley in California. So we have three people, us three working together with three people from UC Berkeley, developing this thing together. SNAP is a block space programming language but it's aimed at high school and college students but as you will see in a second, you can basically start whenever you want with it. Okay, our three guiding principles, let's start with the first one, is low floor. So this means that we really want to have engaging activities for entry level programmers so you don't get scared away and that we really want to have fun activities that they can do. To show you that, I've built a super simple what we call a micro world. So this is an extension of SNAP that I customized myself and this only has these three blocks here and as you can see you don't even have to read to use them. We can just try them out and see what happens. So let me increase the stage size a bit so I can click on that. As you can see it's live so I'm clicking on it while it's in the palette and it's still doing things. I can click on that, nothing happens. I see oh wow there's an input slot here, maybe I could type a number in here. Let's see what happens now. Okay, it's doing something. This is stamping a flower and this one is supposed to be a sponge. It's clearing the stage again. So since we're working with flowers let me draw a beautiful petal real quick using the costume editor. Let's do a yellow one. Oh that's brown. Okay and then let me draw something. And let me even fill it maybe. Yeah wow this is very beautiful and then let's make this even more beautiful and let's also, that's important, move the rotation center. And let's try the same thing again. Ah okay this is pretty cool. So now if I want more flowers I can build a larger script so I can use the central area of snap to build more complex programs. So I could go to a random position and draw another flower there and go to a random position and draw another flower there and so I could click on that forever. But it would also be cool to just have a forever loop that does that. So computers are really good at doing things automatically very often so why don't I make a loop. So I already prepared this page here and let's use for the look for the infinity sign because what I want to build is an infinite loop and let's just copy that and then let's build our own control structure by just hiding it in the actual, I don't know we don't hide it, let's just do it. So this is going to be a control block and I'm calling it infinity. And this is going to have two inputs, one is going to be, no it's only having one input, it's going to be the action. So let me build this block, I already have it here. So okay no let's do that again. Sorry I'll just delete that and start over again. Okay I want to make a control structure, it's called infinity. I want to add a parameter to that and this is the action that I'm going to run. I can even decide what I want this to look like. So as you might know from scratch our loops have the C shaped or from snap our loops have the C shaped command structure. So I can click on that and when I apply that you see that I have the C shaped block with this infinity sign on it and now I need to decide what I want to do with this block. So first I want to run the action, I don't have a run block here so let me just open the hide blocks section and because I hit all the actual blocks from snap and I'll show you how to do that in a second and let me drag out one of the run blocks. And what I want to do is I want to run the action and then I want to repeat the same thing and I want to run the action again. So I think that's correct. Let's try it. So I made myself a forever loop and let's clear the stage so we can actually see what's happening and let me drag this around here and I can run my program and I built myself my own control structure and it still looks very simple for kids but all of you obviously could do that. So this is one thing that we really care about. We want really simple entry level engaging activities and this is one of my favorite starter projects but we also want teachers to be able, educators to be able to build these microverts very easily and we want them to be able to customize snap in a way that they can use it for their needs. What I also wanted to show you in this project, let me make the stage a bit smaller again, you can have several what we call scenes in a project so this is basically a project in another project. So I can now switch to that scene and here I already prepared a petal and you see that I have more blocks than I had before. I also have a separate stage so I can switch between scenes and we can use that idea to build something like language levels. So in the first, in the first micro world I used I just had that block that draws a flower. In the second micro world I want learners to be able to build this flower block themselves. So we gave them all the tools that they need for that. So here for example we only have this block that stamps a leaf, so one of the petals. So what else do I need to build the flower? I want to do that several times so I might need a loop and this one as you can see has a number as an input so I can specify the number of repeats and of course I need a turn in between. So what we want to do is we want to stamp, let's do a flower with six petals and then I need a turn in between and also I build this block myself and I want to turn 60 degrees each time so let's clear before we draw a flower. And then let's do one. So this is how the flower block was actually built in the first thing. So we can help learners to gradually get new ideas. And then which is, which I find pretty cool, it's also super simple in Snap to prepare your own libraries. So I made one if you have a kid in class that is just faster than the other kids. You can export a library and just let them add more blocks. So here I added a few more blocks. For example these ones let me change the appearance of the petal that I have. So this one for example changes the size of it. Let's set this to 100 and then you see the petal becomes super huge. I can set that to 10. Let's clear again. Then it becomes super small so maybe we want to pick something in between and we could even do that randomly. So for example I could add this here and I want the size to be between 20 and 40 and then I get differently sized petals each time I do that. So if I do it like this you see that this changes and I really like that about Snap that you can easily expand projects with fun ideas so they look differently and are more engaging but you only need like one or two more ideas. This one for example switches to the next costume so if I wanted to add another petal let's draw one. Let's do the one that I did before but in blue this time. Let's fill it with something. Okay and then again let's move the rotation center to one of the tips and we can now use that and each time we draw something we draw a different flower. So the next one in line and then again we can combine that with what we had before and just create a beautiful flower field with the blocks that we made. How do you do that if you want to create a micro world? Let me go to the third one I prepared so this is not actually a micro world this is regular Snap with all the blocks that you have so as in other block space programming languages we have different categories here we have the palette on the left where you find all the blocks for a specific category as I mentioned before it's a live programming language so you can just click them and something happens immediately and what I also added here or what I thought I added here but didn't oh that's unfortunate is the so let's just build it is the project so again we want to have all the blocks that we used last time so what we had was the next costume block we had the set size tool block we had the pig random block we also need a division block we had a repeat block we had a forever block we had a stamp block and we had a turn block and what was the last one oh the second to last one was clear and what was the last one go to random position awesome and we need to go to random position and let's assemble these so that we actually can make sure that our script is working so for a flower we want to repeat a specific number of times let's do six times then we want to stamp then we want to turn the number of degrees that's three that's 360 divided by the number of petals that I want so six in this case and before we wanted to do that we wanted to go to a random position so let's check that that seems to work awesome we wanted to do that forever and so that all flowers don't look the same we wanted to set the size to a random position a random size random number let's do twenty to thirty maybe and we need a second costume so let's just duplicate that one and let's change the color a bit yeah this is very different awesome this is exactly what I oh wow okay okay and so we have two costumes so we can actually also use the next costume block and so we start with a clear stage let's add that at the beginning and let's see whether this works okay awesome and now if you want to build your own micro world you can just go to the file menu and select hide blocks and then that's the awesome thing that we added in the second last like the previous release and you can hide all the unused blocks and if I do that I only have the blocks left in the palette that I used for my project and they are in these categories here and I can even make the single palette that I had before by clicking on the settings menu and then selecting the single palette and now you have all the blocks in like one palette and you can make your own micro worlds that have all the blocks that you need for your project that you want to do in class or with your kids or with some other people who want to learn programming and then you can delete that and then you have your perfect passance puzzle generator and so this is again the low floor idea that I mentioned we really want to have engaging activities that have a cool artifact that looks beautiful or is fun to do but we also want to help teachers and educators to create these fun and engaging activities in a simple way okay the second idea that I wanted to present or that we think is or that we care about is white walls so we want to allow for a huge variety of projects and the ones that we care most about media projects so we love this idea of media computation meaning you learn general purpose programming by playing with sounds images texts and one exemplary project for that is for example from snap you can access the microphone of your computer so in this case if it's running it should be and this for example is a visualization of the frequency spectrum of my voice that's just picked up through the microphone so this looks beautiful at the same time as it's interesting because you can talk about sounds from a physical and computational perspective and we love to do stuff with the camera so this is another project that I like very much this is pasting the webcam of my computer to the stage right now I set the transparency to 50% let's make it fully transparent so the video is still there but you can't see it anymore because all the pixels are transparent and then I am sending a message to the other sprite and what's that doing is it's drawing dots on the stage which size corresponds to the brightness that it's measuring in the image that it picks up from the camera and this is actually a pretty cool technique it's called dithering and this is how images were made in newspapers back in the days when you didn't weren't able to print different colors so you just did differently sized dots to get like a more deep color space so this is what we mean with white walls allow a variety of projects that are engaging and fun and that also kids who don't necessarily like Fibonacci might find interesting and the last idea for that I will hand over to Jens is no ceiling so as I said snap is a programming language that's aimed for high schoolers and early college students so it's scratch but with all the awesome ideas that make programming fun and Jens is going to show you this now. Thank you Jadka so we're having kind of a conflict here because we want to have this low floor and the wide walls for the kids but we're also having this idealist notion of blow off the ceiling like we don't want to constrain kids we don't want to dumb down the language so it's okay for kids and this is kind of coming from the sixties when you know some of you might remember logo had the idea that you know you don't you don't make stuff easy for kids but you make it welcoming for kids but you don't constrain it you let kids express everything they can and this is only one part of the pedagogy the other part of the pedagogy is geared as Mark said towards teachers towards educators because if you look at these micro worlds that Jadka has shown let me again go to oh yeah this is mine already so here is a bunch of blocks like these aren't the regular blocks these are the ones that we made okay I need to stay more in the center of so y'all at home can see me we want teachers to be able to build these exercises to build these micro worlds for their kids so it's not just us you know building something here's an exercise you can do with their kids but there's a teacher there's an educator wants to teach something as Yadka did about what was then called you remember the total turtle trip theorem that was kind of what Yadka showed you about so we built a micro world to that which language are they going to build this sub language in are they going to have to learn another language to build these little domain specific languages no you saw Yadka build these blocks in snap itself and so we want to take this even further and find out whether we can maybe even invent a language that lets us build a block space language inside the block space language and for this we really kind of want to do things that we can do in the UI we want to be able to do it in the language so in this palette here I made a little block and it shows me some tools so if I click on this I'm getting some more blocks and I can again hide these it's a very simple block I can build myself that just shows and hides me some blocks and now I can kind of explore some of these things so I can for example look at this block that the flower block and I can see how it is defined and see it is defined with its own blocks so I can open this and edit it but I can also get the definition of this in a program so now I'm getting the definition of this block and I can see that it's a function I can take this out and I can do some other interesting things with that so here is our split block for example I can split hello world by the space and I get hello and world I can split it by letters and I get each letter so what happens if I split a script by blocks let's make this even smaller if I split a script by blocks I'm getting a syntax tree a table of the syntax elements in there so I can do this with you know the definition of my flower block and oh wow so I can so this is a table so I can also flatten this so I'm not saying I don't want the length of this I want it flattened so now I'm getting a list of all the syntax elements that make up the definition of this flower block and that's kind of interesting because now I can find out for example so here I can take out the turn block and I can say you know do all of these um is this list contain this turn block and says yes the turn block is part of the definition of this list so but what about for example the clear block is that also in there no it's not present in there so this is interesting I could maybe discover something else so what I can I can look at all the blocks that I have in this micro world this is a list of all the blocks in this micro world so I'd like to find out which blocks contain this turn block so I could say you know I want to keep I want to filter from my blocks those that contain this block let's see whether that works yeah so I'm getting a list of two blocks that all use this block now I can turn this into its own block I make a block that says this is the colors of a block block and the block should be an input so I'm saying this is a block and in order to define this well I just did define this I just dragged this in and I say okay this should should work for any block so not not just this block but for any block and um so now I have this block that gives me the colors of for example this block let me see whether it works so this block is used by two other blocks and this block isn't used by any other block and huh let me see maybe I can get a whole report by looking at all the blocks and by mapping overall the blocks and I want to see the block and I want to see its colors right so what we're now doing is really an introspection of the system of the block system in itself so if I map this I'm sort of getting this interesting structure it's a data structure it's a table and it's a graph really a reverse dependency graph of all the blocks and the blocks it uses and I get a report of the overall structure of my micro world and folks this is something interesting if you think about this so we're starting with this easy simple thing that we can build worlds for kids and we want to build these little domain specific languages but we want to have a language that actually lets us build these things in itself and this is why we build introspection and kind of all the goodies of functional programming into this language but we didn't want to make it so that you kind of have to go down to memory addresses but we want to represent everything in blocks and this is kind of the idea of no ceiling because at one point you know we start doing this with kids but we actually build it for the University of California at Berkeley and they're using it for the introductory course of computer science for non majors and you know this goes up quite a long way so we actually want to be able to do scheme in this and to really teach abstraction so at one point we really want to blow off the ceiling and we don't want to do just only this imperative style programming where you know one follows the other and you've got the puzzle pieces but we actually do a higher order function you do kind of recursive you build your own control structures you build your own language it's a little stiff and it's challenging to try to accommodate you know the let's draw a flower with a bunch of three blocks to let's invent our own programming language in the same environment and in order to build such an environment the whole thing that you see here at your nerds I can show you right the whole thing you see here isn't using Blockly or a library but what you're seeing here is actually an operating system that runs inside a single canvas element in the browser and there's sort of a pill you can take to switch to dev mode and you're sort of inside this environment that some of you might recognize looks a lot like Squeak so if anybody you know Squeak and so it's kind of the same morphing environment where you could just get you know any things you can directly manipulate them for example you can make this bold but you can also use this to you know let's make a slider I can attach the slider set the target to the string morph to the font size I can change it I can make it horizontal and now my slider governs for example the size the font size of this I can make other elements like for example color palette and I could set the target of the color palette also to the string and now I can change the color and the size I can still edit it so this is basically our own system that is kind of self sustained in the browser and everything that you see in snap is sort of an application inside this really OS inside the browser and comes with its own green threading model which is how we do parallelism so in order to go up on the ladder of abstraction on the back end side we have to go kind of down to not the metal but to kind of a metal of sorts of the browser okay this was kind of our ideas if you'd like to check it out it runs on snap.berkeley.edu give it a try yourself you'll find lots of material there is it's open source by the way it's free and open source is an AGPL license so if you want to know so it's copy lefted so you know everything is open source about it we write the front end the back end the community side it's not as big as some other languages but we've got a vibrant community it's all hosted on github please do contribute please do fork it many people have forked it please let us know what you think and thanks for coming. So I found that really fascinating and as a list programmer I couldn't help but think about macros when you were showing the exploding of blocks so would it be possible once you get the abstract syntax tree to annotate it let's say add a sound between each step and then recreate a new block from an existing block? Yes if we had more time I could show you this we do have macros. So I showed you the split block which takes apart the stuff we have a joint block that you could pass on the syntax tree. Well this is running in the web in a browser so your phone can run the thing in a browser what you get here is you can publish it as a URL and yes and then you can run it on the phone and it's something I like to do with kids a lot it's also interesting if you do stuff on touch devices like on tablets or stuff like that you kind of need to be considerate of which gestures to use because you don't have mouse over or you know so yeah it's fun. That's a good question I really have this dream that I think block space programming if we take away the kitty stigma of it and if we dare move on from this sometimes horrible imperative paradigm to the beauty and joy of functional programming that you know we get these expressions that actually make things easier to understand that make things more accessible and that this is a great way to be to actually you know express many things inside professional development so we write the software in a way that we like to use it ourselves and we hope that it might convince others to actually build and embed this into enterprise applications because often enough if you think about these low code no code things you know you moved you click together some preconfigured stuff but then you need to write some glue code and the glue code often enough is terrible and awful and this is where I would love to see a block space environment that has no ceiling yes it is less it is skiing in the browser yes exactly and we do have stickers and buttons here take all you want yeah yeah thank you very much again.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.200000000000001, "text": " Okay, so hi everyone.
