WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.200
Okay. So, I'm working on a project called the Open Source Observatory, which is managed

00:15.200 --> 00:29.480
by the European Commission, and it is... that should not be blue. Oh well. So, I'm working

00:29.480 --> 00:35.120
on OZOR. The general goals of OZOR are to help the free software community, in particular

00:35.120 --> 00:40.680
in public administrations, for them to use free software. So, we have a bunch of projects

00:40.680 --> 00:44.920
going at the same time. We have a website, the Open Source Observatory, OZOR, where we

00:44.920 --> 00:49.120
publish free software and open source news. We have a knowledge centre where we're gathering

00:49.120 --> 00:55.280
information on case studies of countries that are using free software. We have intelligence

00:55.280 --> 01:00.040
reports on who in each country is involved in different parts of free software, and we

01:00.040 --> 01:06.320
have summaries of all the policies that they have in place. We organise community events,

01:06.320 --> 01:12.440
so this year we will organise three workshops and three webinars, and from each of these

01:12.440 --> 01:16.880
workshops and webinars we will be producing a report, and then the latest project we've

01:16.880 --> 01:20.320
taken on is that we're going to compile these reports together into a handbook at the end

01:20.320 --> 01:26.440
of the year, and this is going to be the best practices on how to use free software in public

01:26.440 --> 01:30.720
administration. So, we'll be looking at different policies that people have in place, do they

01:30.720 --> 01:36.120
work. The folks will be on finding experts that have already gotten free software into

01:36.120 --> 01:40.040
use on desktops and servers and services in public administration. We're going to look

01:40.040 --> 01:44.000
at all the projects, the problems that they've encountered, and we're going to try and find

01:44.000 --> 01:51.280
the solutions that they've found for all these different problems. But, as part of the OZOR

01:51.280 --> 01:58.720
work, we also try and get information out to the free software community to help people

01:58.720 --> 02:03.960
interact with how the European Commission is working on all these regulations that are

02:03.960 --> 02:10.400
going to affect the free software community. So, this is part of the, there is a procedure

02:10.400 --> 02:16.240
for gathering input and doing calls for evidence, but the Commission also works through people

02:16.240 --> 02:22.080
like myself to find the free software community where you are, and then bring the information,

02:22.080 --> 02:29.120
collect feedback, and try and get people to contribute into the process of making these

02:29.120 --> 02:35.160
new regulations. So, in particular, today I'm going to talk about Interactive Europe Act.

02:35.160 --> 02:39.480
Now, because we had a change in the schedule, I've got a bit of extra time, so what I want

02:39.480 --> 02:43.600
to do is I want to make this more of an interactive session. Not the first half, the first half

02:43.600 --> 02:47.360
is going to be me reading slides, but the second half is where I would like to get input

02:47.360 --> 02:52.040
from everyone here. And so, what we're doing is, I'm going to present the Interoperable

02:52.040 --> 02:57.600
Europe Act, and we're going to, I'd like to discuss then how something like an Interoperable

02:57.600 --> 03:03.600
Europe Act can help the free software open source community, and then in what way can

03:03.600 --> 03:07.440
the community and the Commission and the various bodies that are created by this Act, how can

03:07.440 --> 03:16.200
they all collaborate to work together? So, in general, interoperability. The idea is

03:16.200 --> 03:22.240
to help governments and computer systems to interoperate and share data. This often happens

03:22.240 --> 03:27.600
at a national level already. It's already difficult at that stage, but the Interoperable

03:27.600 --> 03:32.320
Europe Act is going to work on this at the European level. And so, the type of problems

03:32.320 --> 03:38.360
it's trying to solve are, for example, very simple problems like reserving a parking space

03:38.360 --> 03:42.160
for your car once you travel into the next country across the border, and you have to

03:42.160 --> 03:46.680
type in the registration plate of your car. If the registration plate isn't in the standard

03:46.680 --> 03:52.240
format, then that system may not allow you to reserve a parking space. A little bit more

03:52.240 --> 03:57.560
complicated is something like hospital beds. So, the idea is that if a Belgian hospital

03:57.560 --> 04:02.600
phones a French hospital and asks, do you have a bed free? And France says, yes, we have

04:02.600 --> 04:07.160
one bed. Then a Dutch hospital phones the same French hospital, and they say, do you

04:07.160 --> 04:11.600
have a bed free? Well, what is the answer? Is it one or a zero, or is it somewhere between

04:11.600 --> 04:16.160
the two? And so, the whole idea is that the idea of data sharing and trying to get all

04:16.160 --> 04:19.960
these hospital systems to work together is generally more complicated than expected.

04:19.960 --> 04:25.360
You have to have either a reservation system or a priority system, which is understandable

04:25.360 --> 04:31.200
to all the other 27 member states. So, these things get pretty complicated. The member

04:31.200 --> 04:35.960
states generally manage to get this to work on their own systems because there's a government

04:35.960 --> 04:40.520
at the top that can tell the hospitals, you know, please have a system that works with

04:40.520 --> 04:44.320
all these other systems or, you know, make sure that you can interoperate. The European

04:44.320 --> 04:48.360
Union can't do that because the European Union doesn't have authority over the hospitals

04:48.360 --> 04:51.400
of Belgium and the hospitals of France and the hospitals of the Netherlands. So, the

04:51.400 --> 04:56.120
European Union can't tell the hospitals what to do. So, the Interoperable Europe Act is

04:56.120 --> 05:02.520
about setting a standard that will apply to the member states for how they will interact

05:02.520 --> 05:08.680
with their hospitals and systems for reserving car parking spaces and other things to make

05:08.680 --> 05:14.120
all these systems work across borders as well as they are working within the borders already.

05:14.120 --> 05:18.400
So, that's an interoperability. And then there's also the idea of data sharing. And so, this

05:18.400 --> 05:22.680
is the third example of when a city wants to introduce some kind of traffic management

05:22.680 --> 05:27.560
system. They may find that other cities across Europe have already done something similar

05:27.560 --> 05:32.680
and they might find a good example. But will that data be available to them or will the

05:32.680 --> 05:36.760
system that has been created by that other member state, will that be available to this

05:36.760 --> 05:41.520
city so they can use the same framework and so they can learn from the same information

05:41.520 --> 05:51.240
that the successful city learned from. So, the current situation is that we have the

05:51.240 --> 05:56.880
European Interoperability Framework. This is the main piece of legislation. This has

05:56.880 --> 06:01.600
been updated a few times. The most recent version was updated in 2017. The main difference

06:01.600 --> 06:07.080
between this and what is being proposed for the moment is that the 2017 text is done-minding.

06:07.080 --> 06:15.400
So, this works on the goodwill and cooperation between member states, but no member states

06:15.400 --> 06:22.600
are not required to do anything by this system. So, then there are also other informal ways

06:22.600 --> 06:27.640
that cooperation has been helped. There is the Digital Europe programme and the join-up

06:27.640 --> 06:32.920
platform. So, the join-up platform is a website where, for example, the open source observatory

06:32.920 --> 06:38.760
is situated. And this is a place where a lot of different projects from the European Commission

06:38.760 --> 06:45.720
are available online and they can share solutions and code repositories and general information

06:45.720 --> 06:51.880
or articles. And this is another way that interoperability has been helped. But again,

06:51.880 --> 06:55.680
it is a voluntary idea because it is making information available in the hope that people

06:55.680 --> 07:00.880
will use it if they would like to use it. And then the third way that interoperability

07:00.880 --> 07:05.640
has been worked on already is through this informal network of CIOs from the member

07:05.640 --> 07:11.120
states and the expert group on interoperability of European public services. So, this is

07:11.120 --> 07:16.440
the human side getting individuals to talk to each other and trying to get interoperability

07:16.440 --> 07:25.840
to happen that way. So, this is useful, but it could be a lot more useful in terms of

07:25.840 --> 07:31.400
making the cooperation between all these cities and member states more efficient. It could

07:31.400 --> 07:38.600
be good to lay down a set of minimum interoperability specifications, ways of sharing data, not

07:38.600 --> 07:45.960
just formats, but the technical specifications for how data will be shared and communicated.

07:45.960 --> 07:52.880
And then the third option in the part is the idea of a binding requirement to have interoperability

07:52.880 --> 08:00.560
by default as an approach when designing new systems and also to promote designing systems

08:00.560 --> 08:06.720
that are interoperable. So, the European Commission has been gathering information and this is

08:06.720 --> 08:11.480
the standard procedure when making a new regulation. They do a call for evidence, a call for input.

08:11.480 --> 08:16.880
They work on impact assessments. They talk to their own research centres, which is the

08:16.880 --> 08:20.960
JRC, the Joint Research Centre, and part of that is the CPS, the Centre for European

08:20.960 --> 08:26.760
Policy Studies. They've gone through these systems. They put together, they did online

08:26.760 --> 08:31.680
consultations and they've got 134 for the impact assessment, 112 replies for the European

08:31.680 --> 08:37.160
Interoperability Framework. They also perform then interviews with specialists or stakeholders

08:37.160 --> 08:44.800
in all these domains. And then presentations like this are the little annex on this because

08:44.800 --> 08:49.480
from all this, they've talked to a load of experts, but has anyone in the room been involved

08:49.480 --> 08:57.360
in any of these procedures? One, okay, that's two, fantastic. So, for everyone else in the

08:57.360 --> 09:01.280
room, this is a way that the European Commission, this presentation is a way that the European

09:01.280 --> 09:05.680
Commission is trying to get information to the public and to the free software community

09:05.680 --> 09:11.080
in particular so that people can participate when and be aware of what can be participated

09:11.080 --> 09:17.640
in. So, the interoperability impact is not the only piece of legislation that is currently

09:17.640 --> 09:23.560
enforced or being worked on. We already have the single digital gateway where Member States

09:23.560 --> 09:29.240
have an automated cross-border exchange of documents. There is the Open Data Directive,

09:29.240 --> 09:33.440
which is for the European Interoperability Framework for designing technical solutions

09:33.440 --> 09:39.000
for the reuse of documents. The European Strategy for Data, which is about interoperability

09:39.000 --> 09:46.680
of data. The Data Governance Act, which is cross-sector data supporting the interoperability

09:46.680 --> 09:52.920
of interoperable Europe framework principles and the core vocabularies of these. The Digitalization

09:52.920 --> 09:58.640
of Justice, which is a general trend, which is to make the IT tools used by the justice

09:58.640 --> 10:03.000
systems interoperable with each other. And then there are two pieces of legislation that

10:03.000 --> 10:06.760
are currently still going through the legislative process. So, these are things that you can

10:06.760 --> 10:12.840
still get involved in. And one is the Data Act, which is on interoperability of data

10:12.840 --> 10:17.320
through among different sectors within Europe. And then we also have the regulation on digital

10:17.320 --> 10:22.760
identity. And this is where Member States have to have digital identity wallets. And

10:22.760 --> 10:27.360
this is to create a standard so that this can interoperate between the different Member

10:27.360 --> 10:37.360
States. So, the European Interoperability Act will be beside or in some cases on top

10:37.360 --> 10:46.840
of these existing pieces of legislation. So, the general goals are to create a consistent

10:46.840 --> 10:53.400
approach to Europe interoperability and to policy making across the Member States to

10:53.400 --> 10:58.360
establish an interoperability governance structure. So, this I'll discuss a little bit later how

10:58.360 --> 11:03.720
exactly that will work and how people here can be involved in that. But this is the second

11:03.720 --> 11:09.120
thing. Besides the technical issues of how technically interoperability should happen,

11:09.120 --> 11:13.080
there's also the governance of all these different structures that will be created and how that

11:13.080 --> 11:20.080
governance should interact with users and experts. Then the last part is the idea of

11:20.080 --> 11:25.680
creating an ecosystem, a general environment for the EU's public sector so that people

11:25.680 --> 11:31.040
can contribute to interoperable solutions and people are aware of what interoperable

11:31.040 --> 11:37.520
solutions exist already and so that this innovation can happen in a collaborative way so that

11:37.520 --> 11:45.400
there is more reuse of code. Because we've seen quite a lot of countries now have gotten

11:45.400 --> 11:49.280
to the stage of accepting free software as a good idea and they publish a lot of source

11:49.280 --> 11:53.520
code for the things they're doing. But we don't yet see a lot of instances where a city

11:53.520 --> 11:58.400
from one Member State will copy a solution from another Member State and start even contributing

11:58.400 --> 12:04.320
back to that solution. So this is the next step in terms of collaboration and making

12:04.320 --> 12:10.200
a good use of free software is the idea of an ecosystem and getting the collaborative

12:10.200 --> 12:19.920
innovation to happen. So inside the Interoperable Europe Act there are these six chapters. I'm

12:19.920 --> 12:28.440
going to focus on three of them. The general idea is that it is a mandatory interoperable

12:28.440 --> 12:34.720
ability that comes with assessments and support and solutions that already exist and encouraging

12:34.720 --> 12:41.720
people to create new solutions. But these pieces of text are from the actual Interoperable

12:41.720 --> 12:45.760
Europe Act. So at the moment what we have is the European Commission has published their

12:45.760 --> 12:53.440
proposal. This then gets handed to the European Parliament which are the directly elected

12:53.440 --> 13:00.280
members of the Parliament there. So these are often the easiest to interact with for

13:00.280 --> 13:06.520
people who are not too involved in the legislative process. It is also handed to the European

13:06.520 --> 13:12.880
Council which is the ministers or the governments of the Member States. So this is a second

13:12.880 --> 13:17.200
group that will be looking at the text from the Commission and they will think about whether

13:17.200 --> 13:22.920
to accept it as is or whether they should propose amendments. So this means the legislative

13:22.920 --> 13:26.840
proposal for creating the Interoperable Europe Act is still ongoing. It's still something

13:26.840 --> 13:31.280
that it's actually in the fairly early stages even and it's still something where people

13:31.280 --> 13:37.080
can get involved and that's what I'm hoping to facilitate here. So this is one piece of

13:37.080 --> 13:45.000
text from the current proposal for an Interoperable Europe Act. This is the share and reuse requirement

13:45.000 --> 13:50.560
and it is one of the parts that definitely directly will affect the free and open source

13:50.560 --> 14:00.560
software community. So what is probably interesting in this is the idea that they've created

14:00.560 --> 14:08.680
a piece of text to encourage the sharing of solutions and so this is what we are quite

14:08.680 --> 14:13.560
used to in the free software community but their definition or the way they describe

14:13.560 --> 14:20.240
this is that if the solutions and which solutions will generally mean software, solutions shall

14:20.240 --> 14:25.840
be made available to any such entity that requests it and shall include documented source

14:25.840 --> 14:33.320
code. So that's their current definition of what it should look like to have Member States

14:33.320 --> 14:39.520
working together on solutions such as software. So this is what the Parliament will now look

14:39.520 --> 14:45.280
at and the Council and for we can interact with the Parliament and the Council to decide

14:45.280 --> 14:52.720
can this be improved, should this be adopted as is or if other people want to change it,

14:52.720 --> 14:56.280
we can give our opinion on whether it should be kept or whether it should be, whether other

14:56.280 --> 15:01.960
changes should be included. So this is one part that I'd like to get some input on at

15:01.960 --> 15:06.400
the end of this session so if you have any comments on how that, whether this definition

15:06.400 --> 15:14.160
is ideal or not that would be interesting. The second part is in chapter two which is

15:14.160 --> 15:20.960
quite a long chapter but I've only included a small amount here. Maybe the most interesting

15:20.960 --> 15:25.080
points are that there will be the creation of the Interoperable Europe portal which

15:25.080 --> 15:31.320
is a place where it will be possible to share solutions and data and to create some kind

15:31.320 --> 15:35.800
of interaction between people who are interested in this topic and to increase transparency

15:35.800 --> 15:43.720
of how work is being done on this. One interesting part of article eight is that there is somewhat

15:43.720 --> 15:51.120
a definition of what free software such open source is. So it says here, I'll highlight

15:51.120 --> 15:55.760
some bits, an open source license means a license whereby the re-use of software is

15:55.760 --> 16:01.720
permitted for all specified uses in a unilateral declaration by the right holder and where

16:01.720 --> 16:09.120
the source codes of the software are made available for users. So this is the first

16:09.120 --> 16:16.560
time I've seen free software or open source license being defined in a European regulation.

16:16.560 --> 16:20.560
Once again this is something that we will have to think about and accept input on and

16:20.560 --> 16:26.440
decide whether this is the way it should be defined or are there improvements that could

16:26.440 --> 16:33.560
be made. The second most interesting part in article three is that the EUPL, the European

16:33.560 --> 16:40.360
Union public license, is suggested as the default license for public administration's

16:40.360 --> 16:49.240
publishing source code solutions. The EUPL for, I'll just present briefly, is a valid

16:49.240 --> 16:53.760
free software license. It's approved by free software foundation and open source initiative

16:53.760 --> 17:03.200
as well. It is a somewhat copy left license. So the EUPL itself includes a copy left clause

17:03.200 --> 17:10.120
so if you're using the EUPL and you publish software and somebody else modifies it, they

17:10.120 --> 17:14.080
also have to publish their source code so it's quite a traditional copy left in that

17:14.080 --> 17:20.080
sense but it has a compatibility clause and the compatibility clause says if you're merging

17:20.080 --> 17:26.680
EUPL source code with another project under a license that's listed in the annex you can

17:26.680 --> 17:33.360
change the EUPL license to the license of that project. So this means, for example, the

17:33.360 --> 17:38.000
GPL v3 is one of the licenses in the annex so if you have a GPL v3 project and an EUPL

17:38.000 --> 17:46.520
project you can merge the two and distribute the whole thing under GPL v3. This is one

17:46.520 --> 17:53.800
way, a very positive, a very useful clause that they've inserted to work on license compatibility

17:53.800 --> 17:59.320
which between copy left licenses is always difficult. On the other hand there are also

17:59.320 --> 18:04.040
licenses in the annex of the EUPL which are not copy left licenses or not strong copy

18:04.040 --> 18:09.760
left licenses and so it's possible that the EUPL software would be merged with a software

18:09.760 --> 18:14.640
project which is under a non-strong copy left license and then the whole would be distributed

18:14.640 --> 18:20.400
without being under strong copy left. So in one sense it's copy left license but also

18:20.400 --> 18:27.440
the there's no guarantee that downstream uses of that code will remain copy left. So that

18:27.440 --> 18:38.960
is the most the most unique part of the EUPL I believe and a second aspect that is quite

18:38.960 --> 18:43.160
interesting of the EUPL is that it has been translated into all the official languages

18:43.160 --> 18:48.160
of the European Union which is quite useful because some member states or cities have

18:48.160 --> 18:52.160
requirements in their law saying that they can only sign contracts that are under their

18:52.160 --> 18:58.160
own official languages. So if there's any difficulty with getting software put under

18:58.160 --> 19:03.760
for example GPL v3 because the GPL v3 is in English there's always the option of getting

19:03.760 --> 19:08.400
the software published under EUPL and it can be kept under EUPL or can be later converted

19:08.400 --> 19:17.720
into GPL v3. So that is the EUPL it's getting more and more used at the moment. So here's

19:17.720 --> 19:24.560
just a map with a few examples of member states that are currently using the EUPL but once

19:24.560 --> 19:31.560
the Interoperable Europe Act comes into force if the current wording is kept the EUPL will

19:31.560 --> 19:36.240
presumably be used by a lot more member states and local governments and so it is a license

19:36.240 --> 19:45.120
that we're going to be seeing more and more use of. So those the chapter one and chapter

19:45.120 --> 19:52.800
two are the technical aspects of the EUPL then chapter four contains the governance structure.

19:52.800 --> 20:00.560
So this part is how interaction is going to be done with experts and with member states

20:00.560 --> 20:06.280
and so the Interoperable Europe Act proposes making an Interoperable Europe Board and then

20:06.280 --> 20:10.600
an Interoperable Europe Community. So these two will work together the Board having a more

20:10.600 --> 20:17.040
executive function the community having more of an input role. They will both interact

20:17.040 --> 20:23.240
with national authorities and national authorities will be required to create national assessment

20:23.240 --> 20:28.040
bodies and there will be interoperability coordinators. The details of how all this

20:28.040 --> 20:35.760
will work might look a little complicated might be a bit complicated as well but is

20:35.760 --> 20:42.920
also not completely defined at the moment. So there have been statements at conferences

20:42.920 --> 20:48.760
to say that the free software community will be included in the Interoperable Europe Community

20:48.760 --> 20:54.240
and the fact that this has been explicitly mentioned by high ranking people in the commission

20:54.240 --> 21:02.240
means that it should be quite a real role which means as a community we now have to

21:02.240 --> 21:08.240
think about how do we want to be involved in an Interoperable Europe Community. If we

21:08.240 --> 21:14.440
are to have representatives how do we choose these. If we are to work with the Interoperable

21:14.440 --> 21:22.200
Europe Board how do what exactly would we be requesting or what would we be suggesting.

21:22.200 --> 21:28.040
And so this is where I will soon come to the interactive part because this will be up to

21:28.040 --> 21:35.000
us to think about how can an Interoperable Europe Interoperable Europe framework help

21:35.000 --> 21:40.600
the free and open source software community. How can it help the software itself in terms

21:40.600 --> 21:48.040
of data formats. What can we do to make sure the data formats and the systems that use

21:48.040 --> 21:54.640
them are systems that can be used by existing free software solutions or if we are developing

21:54.640 --> 22:01.000
new solutions what do we need to make sure that these things are all can all be made

22:01.000 --> 22:10.800
use of by the free software and open source community. So that is the general idea of

22:10.800 --> 22:18.040
the Interoperable Europe Act. It will have all these positive outcomes legal certainty

22:18.040 --> 22:22.160
of course more innovation more agility for public administrations and connected digital

22:22.160 --> 22:29.960
public services. But the reason I am giving this talk here today is because I would like

22:29.960 --> 22:37.560
to have your suggestions. Possibly I was about to suggest possibly from the people who have

22:37.560 --> 22:42.640
already been involved in these various procedures but do you have a microphone for questions

22:42.640 --> 22:46.560
or how do we do. So you could repeat any questions you get so that they are audible on the live

22:46.560 --> 22:49.360
stream because you have the only mic on your shirt. Yeah and people aren't going to come

22:49.360 --> 22:56.360
over here and start. Okay first question. Yes. Yes sir the definition of the definition

22:56.360 --> 23:08.560
of the definition of open standards or the definition of the open knowledge condition.

23:08.560 --> 23:14.800
I am not sure because a lot of the questions. So the question was has there been work while

23:14.800 --> 23:18.680
drafting the text of the Interoperable Europe has there been work to coordinate with the

23:18.680 --> 23:24.080
definition of open standards and the open knowledge centres work on defining open standards.

23:24.080 --> 23:33.360
That correct yes. So when the European Commission is writing their initial proposal for legislation

23:33.360 --> 23:39.280
it is a lot of it is behind the actual drafting it happens internally in the Commission. So

23:39.280 --> 23:45.240
they will have consulted with certain experts and when they did the call for input it would

23:45.240 --> 23:49.800
have been possible for open knowledge centre or any of these organisations to participate

23:49.800 --> 23:55.000
during that stage. A lot of the time these things get missed by people who should be

23:55.000 --> 24:00.120
interested in these topics and that is partly just because there are so many different pieces

24:00.120 --> 24:05.440
of regulation going through the systems that we can't be aware of everything that is happening.

24:05.440 --> 24:09.120
So it is possible that they have not been involved during the elaboration of the text

24:09.120 --> 24:13.600
up until now but this stage of the legislative process where the text then gets handed over

24:13.600 --> 24:18.520
to the Parliament and to the Council and is visible to the general public this is where

24:18.520 --> 24:26.560
there is now a chance for everyone involved to comment on the text and that's what I'm

24:26.560 --> 24:31.480
here today to make sure the people who weren't aware of it until now are aware and can start

24:31.480 --> 24:56.200
participating. We had one other person. It is a regulation. I didn't have the word on

24:56.200 --> 25:04.520
the slide but the text is publicly available. As far as I remember it is a regulation and

25:04.520 --> 25:08.720
so it would be directly enforceable rather than a directive has to be implemented by

25:08.720 --> 25:15.680
the member state so there is one step of implementation there but it will be a regulation

25:15.680 --> 25:26.680
so it will be binding to all the member states. Yes, sorry I forgot to repeat the question.

25:26.680 --> 25:52.800
So the question is what the general feeling is on whether the text will be changed now

25:52.800 --> 25:57.480
or what the member states and the Parliament think about and what their capacity is or

25:57.480 --> 26:05.000
the capability is for dealing with topics such as this. So we have not yet gotten much

26:05.000 --> 26:10.800
feedback from the member states. There are a lot of pieces of legislation going through

26:10.800 --> 26:16.800
the system at the moment partly because there will be a new set of policy makers elected

26:16.800 --> 26:23.800
next year and so there is somewhat of a rush to get some piece of legislation through.

26:23.800 --> 26:30.920
Technical topics like this are always a little bit difficult for policy makers to work on

26:30.920 --> 26:36.600
and there is always the worry that will our issue get the attention it deserves but what

26:36.600 --> 26:41.480
I have generally found is there are always a few people in the Parliament who do understand

26:41.480 --> 26:47.880
this topic they understand whatever topic is given to them. There are also in the Council

26:47.880 --> 26:54.280
each member state has their own set of experts and they will have somebody who is an expert

26:54.280 --> 26:58.720
on it could be standard setting or it could be digital solutions but they will have people

26:58.720 --> 27:03.960
who do understand these topics so it is not so much that the MEPs don't work directly

27:03.960 --> 27:08.800
on this themselves but each MEP in the Parliament they will have a team of assistants and each

27:08.800 --> 27:15.600
group in the Parliament will also have an external team of policy experts and so if

27:15.600 --> 27:19.920
you are looking at the MEPs and you are wondering will this person really understand the text

27:19.920 --> 27:25.280
you have to take into account that it is not the MEP on their own who works on the text

27:25.280 --> 27:31.080
it is their office who will work on the text and so within each MEP's office there will

27:31.080 --> 27:35.480
be well each MEP that is going to work on this directly there should be somebody who

27:35.480 --> 27:40.040
is who understands this and that is part of the job of anyone who wants to get involved

27:40.040 --> 27:45.000
in it is to identify the people in the Parliament in the Council who are the experts and who

27:45.000 --> 27:49.720
do understand this and then try and work with them to improve the text and then within their

27:49.720 --> 27:53.640
groups and within the Parliament they will generally be seen as an expert and then they

27:53.640 --> 28:06.280
would have a larger influence on how the text should be changed.

28:06.280 --> 28:24.240
I think it is something that is shared when I hear the questions and I think it is really

28:24.240 --> 28:37.800
a big political game to get on the table and get the right people on the table but for

28:37.800 --> 28:41.800
example on the member of the extendence foundation it is all about the infallible chat I just

28:41.800 --> 28:53.800
made the budget what it would cost our foundation to probably react to the digital market sex

28:53.800 --> 29:07.800
And to participate also in a community input would be really a big stress for our organization.

29:07.800 --> 29:13.800
So I think we could have lots to contribute there.

29:13.800 --> 29:22.800
Lots of useful input because I think that digital marketing could have been much better if they would have conserved the place.

29:22.800 --> 29:33.800
But they're out of resources to do it and still it's a big game who's there and who should be there.

29:33.800 --> 29:59.800
The comment is that it is very important who is at the table and who will be involved in these negotiations and in giving input and it's always a difficult decision to make on how many resources we can put in a community organization or even a company can put into participating in this particular legislative procedure when there are also so many other that are also very important to work on.

29:59.800 --> 30:06.800
And yeah, it's a devalued comment and that's like we're trying to make it through this presentation through coming to FOSTA.

30:06.800 --> 30:11.800
I'm trying to be part of making it easier to participate in this. At least people will be aware of it.

30:11.800 --> 30:17.800
And then yeah, it's always, you know, whatever can be put into it, it will hopefully be beneficial.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.800
But people will, everyone does their best.

30:21.800 --> 30:31.800
I'm wondering how do you think that this will benefit the general open source community?

30:31.800 --> 30:39.800
These acts, they say that agencies must publish as open source but it doesn't say they will use it.

30:39.800 --> 30:55.800
What they often see is that they just hire a bunch of consultants from ATOS or whatever, Gemini, but they don't hire actual open source developers. They just hire a bunch of people using a consulting framework.

30:55.800 --> 31:09.800
Then they just download the free software for free and they say, oh look how much open source we need, but that doesn't benefit us as a community. I do think this will improve that.

31:09.800 --> 31:13.800
Because I don't see any things that like what the previous commenter said about funding of the community and supporting the community really.

31:13.800 --> 31:18.800
It just says you must make open source but it doesn't say support the real makers.

31:18.800 --> 31:37.800
So the question is how will this really benefit free software open source developers if we already have a lot of government agencies who already download free and open source software and they use it but this doesn't actually lead to contributions to the software or it doesn't help other people who are writing projects.

31:37.800 --> 31:53.800
And so I would say the way this could benefit free software developers is by making public how interoperability will happen, it will make it easier for a project to develop the software necessary to interact with these services in that way.

31:53.800 --> 32:06.800
Because at the moment if we have 27 different ways of reserving a hospital bed somewhere and if all these, if the specifications are not public, well then it's very difficult for a free software developer to come along and say well I'm going to write a hospital bed reservation system.

32:06.800 --> 32:17.800
But if the specifications and the data formats and the procedures for performing these tasks were transparent and public and then that's already one step that would be useful.

32:17.800 --> 32:30.800
And then if France develops a system and they publish the source code for theirs and Belgium develops a system and they publish the source code for theirs then this also gives us reference implementations for how to interact within these frameworks.

32:30.800 --> 32:37.800
And so I think I would have thought that was the problem you asked but would you like to do a follow up comment?

32:37.800 --> 32:51.800
Yeah, I don't think that that's because I think then it's just the consultancy firms that develop these open source services and I mean as an open source developer you probably don't invest up front a lot of money and time to do something.

32:51.800 --> 32:57.800
I don't know how you see that. I couldn't then still be developed by big companies.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.800
Okay, is this the same comment?

33:00.800 --> 33:07.800
Yeah, actually the add-on to this. The thing that I see happening is of course I'm from the States so I have a whole different environment I have to deal with.

33:07.800 --> 33:16.800
But they sat there and go oh here's billions of dollars for open source. Okay, great. What's the procurement path into that money being distributed?

33:16.800 --> 33:20.800
Because all that's going to happen is you're going to have these huge consultancy firms come in.

33:20.800 --> 33:29.800
If we're lucky they dump 8,000 lines of code on us which doesn't go through our process, doesn't go through any of those things properly, they don't behave correctly.

33:29.800 --> 33:38.800
There's all of these different problems that happen and there's nothing to actually address that piece of the fact that there's not a good procurement process.

33:38.800 --> 33:44.800
I know in the States it's horrible. There's no way an individual developer could ever go through the process to ever see any of that money.

33:44.800 --> 33:50.800
You know, it's impossible. I don't know what the processes are like here in the different countries either.

33:50.800 --> 33:59.800
But I know that that procurement pathway ends up being the thing that's really devastating to actually helping the open source structures that exist.

33:59.800 --> 34:08.800
Because most of them actually are non-profits too. I mean how many of them are set up as actual non-profit structures and do we have a clean way to get that government money?

34:08.800 --> 34:13.800
No, you have to go through. You have to be a business. You have to be a business of a certain size.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.800
Okay, so the question then is...

34:19.800 --> 34:25.800
The question is how do free software developers get access to the funding for developing free software in public administrations

34:25.800 --> 34:32.800
and how do you avoid that all this money gets given to big consultancy firms who dump code without participating in community procedures

34:32.800 --> 34:42.800
and the procurement rules will not be of any use to free software companies who would be able to do proper collaboration with the community.

34:42.800 --> 34:52.800
Procurement is a national level competence so the European Commission is not going to be telling Member States how to work on procurement.

34:52.800 --> 35:01.800
What will happen with interoperability is that the formats and the procedures and the frameworks will become transparent

35:01.800 --> 35:05.800
and there will be reference implementations at least available.

35:05.800 --> 35:12.800
So in that sense where it was very difficult to interoperate with all these public administrations

35:12.800 --> 35:20.800
it should be with open specifications and with source code and implementations. It should be a lot easier at the very least.

35:20.800 --> 35:27.800
Who ends up getting paid to develop the software? That is something that will be dealt with outside of this legislation

35:27.800 --> 35:37.800
and it will have to be worked on in some other texts, probably at the national level.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.800
Two for you.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.800
Quickly.

35:42.800 --> 35:49.800
The willingness in the commission or recognition that maybe we should just dump all this on GitHub

35:49.800 --> 35:56.800
and have a platform within the European Union that is used to host this code.

35:56.800 --> 36:02.800
The follow up on that is are there any AI training clauses in this license?

36:02.800 --> 36:10.800
So the two questions are should the European Commission have their own code hosting website instead of using GitHub and are there any AI clauses?

36:10.800 --> 36:15.800
AI is not in this but there is also an AI Act which is currently going through the legislative process

36:15.800 --> 36:21.800
and so that's something where it's still halfway through the legislative process.

36:21.800 --> 36:26.800
If people want to get involved in that that would be very useful.

36:26.800 --> 36:37.800
GitHub, the European Commission's code sharing site is code.europa.info.

36:37.800 --> 36:47.800
So this is something they put online I think last October and so they have their own code hosting site

36:47.800 --> 36:54.800
and this is one of the ways they hope to encourage people, projects from the European Union to collaborate and work together

36:54.800 --> 36:58.800
and so yes it won't be on GitHub.

36:58.800 --> 37:02.800
This is only for European institutions and not for local governments?

37:02.800 --> 37:06.800
At the moment I believe the projects that are there are only European institutions

37:06.800 --> 37:15.800
but it is also the goal is for it to be broadened out and I expect that it will also be for local governments

37:15.800 --> 37:20.800
but it is only online the last three or four months so that's the start.

37:20.800 --> 37:25.800
Sorry the question there was what goes on the code.europa.info portal.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.800
Do you have one more question?

37:27.800 --> 37:28.800
We have time for two questions.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.800
Two, okay.

37:29.800 --> 37:46.800
I have a question, is there a consideration how much complexity exists within the member states?

37:46.800 --> 38:00.800
We build a group of concepts and it kind of died in the draw because there was no confidence in getting consensus among the 16 member states of Germany

38:00.800 --> 38:13.800
so the standards within each member state of the European Union are also really different and getting consensus there is hard.

38:13.800 --> 38:25.800
The question is is there any consideration for the complexity within a member state in terms of implementing all these different IT systems?

38:25.800 --> 38:32.800
The Interoperable Europe Act will focus on making sure that interoperability is possible.

38:32.800 --> 38:45.800
How complex it is for a country which has 60 regions or in Belgium where you've got seven governments, how difficult it is for these things to work together is still something that the member states have to work on themselves.

38:45.800 --> 38:53.800
Each member state can define their own number of regions and provinces and communes and communities and that is something they all have to deal with.

38:53.800 --> 39:08.800
So those technical solutions won't be solved by Interoperable Europe Act but by making specifications, file formats and procedures transparent it might have the knock-on effect of also making it easier to work on those problems.

39:08.800 --> 39:23.800
To mention the European Commission doesn't want to interrupt into the procurement practices in national states, why not? It could be harmonized in all of you.

39:23.800 --> 39:37.800
So the question is why the European Commission wouldn't get involved in procurement policies in member states?

39:37.800 --> 39:55.800
The answer is mostly that for certain member states certain things are very sensitive and there are some things that some people wish was at a European level and for other people it is completely unacceptable that this would be at the European level.

39:55.800 --> 40:09.800
And so even within public procurement if you're going to have a national policy then you also have to think about regional governments and local governments and communities. So it would be very difficult to get agreement across all these different institutions.

40:09.800 --> 40:22.800
For everyone to say yes the European Commission is the person who should define how the region of south-west Dublin should procure software. So it's just part of the complexity of the European situation.

40:22.800 --> 40:29.800
There was one question over here and I'll give a chance to people who haven't spoken yet.

40:29.800 --> 40:56.800
Thank you. I see that the legislation is a good step forward but on the other hand open source success depends on the right mindset on community building and exchange. Is there any initiative ongoing to spread the mindset for using and reusing

40:56.800 --> 41:05.800
the particular open stuff like that? I mean it's not done by just publishing and there must be a mindset to take that out like we use it.

41:05.800 --> 41:16.800
So the question is is there any philosophy or mindset or strategy within the European Commission to encourage participation in open source development and collaboration with the community.

My time is up so I have to thank you for the input. I'm going to hang around if people have more questions I will be available so thank you all very much.
