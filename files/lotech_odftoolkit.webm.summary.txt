 

In this talk, Svante Schubert discussed the ODF Toolkit, an open source Java-based implementation of the ODF standard which is used for exchanging documents between different applications such as LibreOffice and Microsoft Office. He discussed the importance of high-level APIs such as the DOM tree and the online validator, as well as the need for semantic layers for file formats like ODF. He concluded by highlighting their recent work on the ODF Toolkit and the need for further discussion on feature level abstractions to facilitate document exchange.
