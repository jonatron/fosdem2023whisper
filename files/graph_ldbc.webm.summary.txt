The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about the LDBC social network benchmark, which is a non-profit company founded in 2012 that aims to accelerate progress in graph data management. The benchmark consists of multiple workloads, including an interactive workload and a business intelligence workload. The benchmarks test the performance of graph database management systems and aim to push the state of the art in the field. The talk also mentioned the development of new standard graph query languages, such as SQL PGQ and GQL. Additionally, the talk mentioned the Graphalytics benchmark, which focuses on analyzing large graphs using various graph algorithms. The LDBC encourages companies to join and participate in the benchmark design process, and also offers auditing services for benchmark results. The talk concluded by mentioning that there are future benchmark ideas in the works, including graph neural network mining and streaming benchmarks.
