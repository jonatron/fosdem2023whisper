The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 focused on achieving sustainability in computing through energy-efficient placement of Kubernetes workloads. The speakers discussed the carbon emissions of the technology industry and introduced a cloud-native sustainability stack consisting of two projects: Kepler and the Kepler Model Server. Kepler measures power consumption by hardware resources and exports them as Prometheus metrics, while the Kepler Model Server provides trained models to predict energy metrics when a power meter is not available. The talk also covered carbon intensity-aware scheduling and demonstrated how it can be implemented. The speakers shared their roadmap for future enhancements to the sustainability stack and addressed questions about energy consumption attribution and the credibility of carbon intensity data.
