The talk highlighted a challenge of deploying, orchestrating, and managing confidential applications in a scalable and cloud-native way using a tool called Marble Run. The speaker provided a use case with Bosch to demonstrate the challenge and then went on to explain the challenges that arise when deploying such technology. Marble Run, the control plane for scalable confidential apps, addresses these challenges by providing an orchestratable and manageable deployment that can be used in Kubernetes and cloud environments. The speaker explained the key features of Marble Run, including a manifest that defines packages, models, and roles, and how the control plane component works to provide credentials, secrets, and configurations to the services. The demo showed how a user can interact with Marble Run CLI, install Marble Run, set the manifest, and deploy an application. The talk concluded with a few self-advertisements, including the Open Confidential Computing Conference coming up in March.
