The talk is about eBPF loaders, which are programs that interact with the kernel via syscalls. The speaker explains that loaders are necessary because eBPF programs cannot be executed directly like regular C programs, and they need to be loaded and assembled by a loader. The speaker discusses the structure of eBPF programs and demonstrates how loaders put the pieces of the program together and provide the necessary information to the kernel. The speaker also highlights the importance of BTF (BPF Type Format) which provides type information to the kernel and allows for compile-once-run-everywhere functionality. The talk concludes with a question about the possibility of creating a loader that can directly execute eBPF binaries or using the kernel's bnfmt_misc feature to load eBPF ELF files.
