The speaker, Philip Holmberg, discusses a project funded by NLNetLabs to create a library function that can handle DNS name resolution and cryptography. The function utilizes LibEvent to make it non-blocking and can handle multiple addresses, TLS, and DNS policy configurations. Holmberg also talks about a new ETNS zero option that can be used to control a local proxy to reduce the step resolver footprint. The talk also briefly touches on the use of Rust in the project, and there is a suggestion to consider integrating with an existing project called LibVerde to simplify some of the complexity.
