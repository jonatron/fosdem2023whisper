{"text": " Okay, please welcome our next speaker, Ivan, to talk about contracts for free. Hi everyone. It's a really quick talk about the Akitoi project and some unpopular opinion about using runtime types. So the thing is, there is an old issue, maybe you know it, in NICS, which was closed since because it will never be implemented, which is a bit embarrassing about the fact that NICS have no any static type system, and the thing is, I changed my mindset relatively recently about that, but I will talk about it later, because what's the issue about the type system? It's the lack of a static type system, it's the error you'll get, you'll get them at the last moment. It's really inconsistent regarding where the mistakes were made, and when you read your stack trace, you get out time to find what was the actual error, and that is really not helpless for, for example, beginners trying to work on NICS expression or people trying to debug NICS expression right then by other person. So I changed my mindset because NICS is a really simple language, and it should be a simple language, and it invites us to build construct in library space, and if you look at NICS built-ins, for example, it's really few built-ins, and a lot of things that could be built-ins are actually implemented as NICS by Quage, LibSync, and there is a NICS by Quage, LibTypes, maybe without NNES, which is what you use when you define NICS option to say the option could be that or that and everything, and so I changed my mindset because NICS is made in two steps, you know, so it's the first step that you evaluate the language and produce things in NICS to review, symbols in NICS store, and after you build, you made your Quage, but the instantiate part is guaranteed to terminate, you know, you will, the computation will always terminate, which is what you expect for a type system actually, and which is not the case of some type system or most of macro systems that are not expected to terminate, so actually it's a good guarantee, and that's why we could do a lot of things in NICS, you can see it as, I changed my mind because I see that NICS is not really about the runtime and programming language, so we could do a check at runtime, and I wrote a thing while a vacation and realized later that other folks already did it, which is Tajjin, maybe you know him, he works on Twix, Twix right now, and he also writes NICS OnePager, one of the best NICS starting guide at some point, and the thing is, it's really simple, you define the data you want, just validate your function, so you say, I want something like that, and you check at this point of your NICS expression what it evaluates, that's its respect to a contract, a validator function, and that's help actually there to fail early where you want it to fail, there is differences in implementation, I will not talk really about, but I really simply didn't rely on NICS package, and it's fully compatible with NICS exception, so you can define a thing, and the last thing is, those composes, I go back inside, you can define types, you can define validator, instruct, that became validator, and you can compose really complex things, because it's really expressive, and also the nice things with runtime types is you can produce recoverable error, which is the case for types errors that exist in NICS itself, so for example, this will be unrecoverable, but if you use the runtime type, you would recover this situation. Last thing is, I try to advertise this kind of technique, because it helps a lot to debugs your application and to have assertion about this, respect that and everything, it doesn't really solve the problem, because it's not a real type system actually, but if you're not starting something from scratch, if you actually working on an existing NICS expression, NICS expression could be actually really large, I think personally it helps, if you're starting a new thing from scratch, there's really cool things like Q, dial, NICL, generate JSON, and you use that live in NICS package, so you can use it really easily, and there is also, I like personally plural NICS, because it generates NICS output results and JSON, okay, I think I said most of what I would say, so don't hesitate if you have a question or want to share it with you. You don't have time? Thank you, it was really good presentation.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 16.76, "text": " Okay, please welcome our next speaker, Ivan, to talk about contracts for free.",
