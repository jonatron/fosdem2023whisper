 

In his talk, Tim Tobake, a staff software engineer at Moderna, introduced Open Rewrite, a tool that can make light work of migrations. It makes use of a parser that reads and modifies Java to produce lossless semantic trees which can be modified to move from one language version or framework to another. It can be used to migrate between various versions of Java, Spring and other libraries, frameworks and platforms, such as switching from JUnit to AssertJ. He also discussed how Custom migration recipes can be created for open source projects and showcased what improvements are happening and what is still to come.
