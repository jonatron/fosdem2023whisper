{"text": " I'll start, hopefully. 30 slides and 10 minutes. Excellent. So, there's a next button here. I eventually will get there. Good. So, a good number of things changed over lock down and perhaps you're interested in that. So, Caliber Online is an amazing piece of software and it built on LibreOffice technology. And one of the things that we really, really you'd have noticed changed, I guess, in lock down was that we bend this dialogue saying this is an unsupported version of whatever. Yeah, we thought this was a good way to encourage people to consider supporting the project and getting something, you know, supported and contributing back, but it turned out everyone hated it. Even I hated it. So, there you go. Even though it did a good thing. So, we got rid of that and after a large discussion which doesn't bear repeating, yeah, we then decided to use the Collaborate brand to make people aware that you could get something. So, one of the biggest and most significant changes, I guess, was removing that and providing then a free version that anyone could deploy at scale without asking anyone, which is kind of cool if you're like that sort of thing. And yeah, so there's a bit of a catch-22 there and we are around it. So, the things that changed, I guess, is now public unlimited online binaries and we also published all of our SDK documentation, Docker image build instructions and just got a lot more open. And Italo, wherever he has came up with this inspired umbrella brand for LibreOffice technology, I guess, that's, yeah, this platform for personal productivity. So, quite a lot of sort of end-user facing change there. And obviously, making those two things work together nicely and be friendly is important. So, we spent lots of time putting, you know, LibreOffice technology logos into the here and there. Those are such, and the next cloud office as well. I guess I got these two the wrong way around, but anyway. And everything was beautiful except no one could see it at TDF. Oh, I need to move this way, right, out of the frame. Sorry. Because Guillem is a genius and the cleverly locked down the CSP rule so you couldn't actually fetch the logo from your client because it was forbidden. So, we then had to implement a whole load of work to get the server to download and then re-serve the image. There's some kind of funky HTML proxy built into CloudBronline for this image. So, anyway, it gets out there now. And so, when you click on it, you get these nice credits that tell about all the good work that everybody has done. So, hopefully, there's even pictures you might feature if you're careful. And there's some more branding there planned. So, we have a welcome screen that comes up now and shows you the differences and we'd love to get this accelerated. Sadly, we're a bit busy at the moment, which is good, all good, for LibreOffice. So, I just wanted to talk quickly about some of the things that we've done because that's quite fun in the technology underneath. So, there you go. Look at this lovely logo. So, one of the things then is to make the blockchain useful and which means providing money to us to do LibreOffice hacking, obviously. And so, we got rid of this really deeply annoying dialogue which was triggered by all those clever people that accidentally had typed in the far right corner of their spreadsheet once and made the size apparently larger, which was really good. Hopefully, lots of people enjoy that. Content control. So, this is just Microsoft has many strata of content controls. You know, every idea has been tried many times. And these, I guess, the latest one, and say, McClosh has done a fantastic job. I think had a talk really on this to implement those so that we can do all sorts of forms and things and then starting to add things on top. Press color theming. Lots of beautiful interruptions. Chart data tables. Everyone likes, you know, pictures. Well, some people like pictures. Others like numbers. So, well, you can have both on the same screen and hopefully see it in your slides, which is kind of cool. Yeah, deep hole. Yes, built in language translation. Just sort of you need to get your German into English or vice versa. And yeah, that's all good fun. And hopefully then with formatting of some degree as well. You can imagine perhaps the problems of turning this into HTML, translating it and then trying to get your styles back at the other end. And anyone that wants to help improve that, I'm sure will be thrilled to have some help making it better. So, that's all good fun. What else? I missed the button? No? Good. And then there's whole loads of things we've done in Collaboration Online. So, one of the things I'm excited about is language tool. So, people ask me, what about your artificial intelligence story? And of course, you know, we need some intelligence around. That's for sure. If only we had some, you know. And a robot seems like a good way of providing it, you know, reproducible, repeatable. Anyway, the wonderful people at Language Tool have managed to build an open source business sort of off the back of Grammarly's market positioning and price setting skills. And so, they're making money selling open source things here are built around the open source language tool and contributing loads of good code. And yeah, they're based in Potsdam. So, it's thrilling to be able to integrate with them and to get much better grammar checking. And of course, you can run Language Tool on your premise. So, you're not sending it all to some random other server. You're sending it to your own random other server, which is good. So, that's all fun. And then of course, the Duden corrector has been integrated with people like this, you know. Actually, these are both German companies, I believe. So, you know, your genitives are safe with us, you know. But anyway, so, a similar web service there and that can be integrated. How really flowing your text positioning beautiful boats for core, you know, in just the right place, you know. It's very, very important to get your images nice. Yeah, you can see the anchor. Yeah, it's one of those metaphors that's probably not used. It's like the floppy disk anchor, you know. I don't know how many people sail. But anyway, sailors get their images in good places. And putting that into the web UI. There's some chunk of accessibility work and just ease of use stuff around the formula entry building on Quailon's work to make formula entries. JS Dialogable, which is all good. That came for our mobile thing. The accessibility checker, I guess we brought that to the online suite so that you can see all of the many failings that you have in your accessibility and then maybe fix them, which would be good. And then lots of work from, I guess, Shimon primarily, but Pedro and others on bringing JS Dialogs, more JS Dialogs. So, having the dialogues, again using Quailon's WX widgets like welding framework, we can move these and run them then on the client, which brings whole loads of prettiness and performance and accessibility improvements. What else? Delta's. So, we also, the way Clabber Online works is it has tiles. It splits your documents into 256 pixel square tiles, which at least in the past I was told is optimal for some GPUs on mobile phones. And it seems like a good size. So, we do that, but we now use Delta's for that as well. So, as you type your hello or H something, it will find just the H and then it will compress that. And previously we did this PNGs. And PNGs, well, they use deflate and deflate is, well, as you can see, really bad. Not only is it slow, it also produces big compressed data. So, Z standard is much better and we do that now. And yeah, thanks to Facebook for their contribution to digital sovereignty and control of your data. That's fantastic. So, what else? Ah, various new exciting dialogues, property things, innumerable PDF options built in. So, new export stuff, some great things there from the team. What else? Online embedded video playback. If you have embedded videos, you can drop them in and get them. Of course, codecs are the hidden nightmare of any kind of video. It's a disaster area. But we just use what your browser has. So, let's hope your browser is doing well. And luckily, browsers seem to have reasonably good codec supports. Somehow, what else can I say? Come heck with us. It's cool. Talk to us. Get involved. And the cool kids are all using LibreOffice technology. So, you should be too, if you're not. There's a LibreOffice hackfest this Monday and Tuesday. So, that's not tomorrow, but the day is after. At the business and technology incubator. So, if you want to be incubating, you know, technology, you can go, beta code working. It's a great place and you can take a photograph and then you'll have all the details you need. And in March, we're having something in Clare College, Cambridge. Again, you're welcome. There'll be a LibreOffice hackfest there. Come make us open source rock with us. And that's about it. Thank you. Any questions? Oh, God. Forty-seven seconds for questions. I lie. Forty-two. You know. Never mind. Well, thank you very much. Grab me over a beer afterwards. Thank you.
