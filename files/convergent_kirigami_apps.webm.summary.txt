This talk was about Kegami, a framework for developing mobile, desktop, and convergence applications, first announced in 2015. Developed to help with the issue of duplication of efforts when working on both mobile and desktop applications, Kegami is written in Qt's QML language, and offers a single codebase for developing for both platforms. The talk discussed Kegami's recent introductions, partnerships, and long term goals moving forward. It concluded with a discussion of the porting of Plasma desktop applications to Kirigami and how that goal is striving for consistent interactions across both QT widget and Kirigami applications.
