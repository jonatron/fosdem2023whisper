The project also explores potential partnerships and revenue sources, including managed instances for enterprises, nonprofits, and educational institutions. David mentions the importance of feedback and encourages users to visit the Crip Pad forum. In the Q&A session, he addresses questions about verifying server code, advising activists to use Crip Pad, monitoring for criminal uses, and adoption in France.
