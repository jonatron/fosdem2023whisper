The talk presented by Frédéric Danisse at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 covered the Bluetooth test in WirePlumber and PipeWire, which are designed for desktop and intended to replace PulseAudio and JACK Audio systems. Danisse discussed the Bluetooth classic audio profiles, which are divided into two categories, mono and stereo, and the A2DP codec, which aims to manage audio streaming between media player and headset or speakers. He also explained the HFP profile, which is used for communication usage and defines the commands to interact with telephony. Finally, he gave a quick overview of the new low-energy audio specifications, which unify stereo and mono audio profiles and replace A2DP and HFP with a better sound quality and new codec.
