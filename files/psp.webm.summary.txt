In this talk, the speaker discusses their work on writing two emulators for the PSP, focusing on Dreamcast and DS emulation. They explain that the earlier attempts at emulating these consoles on the PSP were proof of concepts, but with better tools and understanding, they hope to achieve better results. They discuss the challenges of emulating the DS on the PSP, such as the lack of touchscreen and the unique graphics architecture. They also explore different DS emulator options and their pros and cons. They then move on to the Dreamcast emulation, which they explain is a bigger challenge due to the PSP's lower specs compared to the Dreamcast. They discuss the progress and milestones they have achieved in Dreamcast emulation, including full-speed gameplay in some games. They also mention potential optimizations and improvements that can be made in the future. Overall, they express optimism about the future of PSP emulation and the progress they have made so far.
