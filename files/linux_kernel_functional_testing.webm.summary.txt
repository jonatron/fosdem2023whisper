The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about LKFT, the Linux Kernel Functional Testing Project. The speaker, RÃ©mi Duraffort, explained that LKFT aims to improve the Linux kernel quality on the ARM architecture by performing regression testing and reporting in real time. He described the architecture of LKFT and the various tools they have created and maintained, including Textmake for building, Textrun for testing on virtual devices, Lava for testing on physical devices, Keyscache for caching artifacts, and Squad for storing and reporting test results. The speaker also mentioned their collaboration with the kernel developers and their efforts to report and fix bugs.
