The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about a project called LeapPoke, which consists of several components, including an incremental compiler for the Poke programming language, a Poke virtual machine, and an abstraction layer to address bits from iOS devices. The speaker also discussed the Poke CLI application and PokeD, which they described as a demon or server for the project. They then introduced PacMe, an interface inspired by ACME that combines Pokelets with T-Max to create a dynamic and interactive terminal user interface. The speaker demonstrated various features of PacMe, such as executing Poke code, manipulating windows, and interacting with binary data using Pokelets and T-Max. They also mentioned that PacMe can be used with other interfaces, such as Emacs and WebSocket, and has support for future integration with Screen.
