The speaker introduces the C-PASS project, which aims to create a software-centric power grid control architecture. They explain that the project is inspired by the North American model of transitioning from a hardware-centric to a software-centric approach. The C-PASS project focuses on using open-source software to achieve flexibility, scalability, and adaptability in the power grid. They discuss the need for real-time and high-latency capabilities, as well as the importance of security and patchability. The speaker also describes the testing process for the project, using tools like the Linux firmware validation framework. They highlight the use of the Yocto project for creating a custom Linux distribution and the challenges of implementing the CI for the Yocto version. The speaker concludes by mentioning future work, such as running longer tests and implementing an update mechanism for flashing machines.
