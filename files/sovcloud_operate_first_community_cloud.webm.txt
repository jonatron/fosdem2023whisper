[00:00.000 --> 00:16.560]  Okay, thank you for showing up in person and so many people, so it's actually my first
[00:16.560 --> 00:24.120]  time at FOSSTEM and I think it's super excited to see so many people and coming back to conferences
[00:24.120 --> 00:32.200]  but also such a crowded conference so I mean the talks previously were super full now it's
[00:32.200 --> 00:39.520]  almost half full or half empty depending on how you look at it and even for such supposedly
[00:39.520 --> 00:47.960]  boring topics like a sovereign cloud I mean that's immediately sparked associations with
[00:47.960 --> 00:55.120]  state and GDPR I mean all the cookies that you have to click away so sounds boring at first
[00:55.120 --> 01:01.560]  but I think there's also some value in it and I think there's a journey where open source can
[01:01.560 --> 01:09.320]  help to make a sovereign clouds come to life or like look at some aspects of it this is me I go
[01:09.320 --> 01:16.840]  by the name due random on GitHub and on social media three days ago I changed roads so now I'm
[01:16.840 --> 01:23.680]  in sales again yikes for as a managed open shift black belt so I'm still looking at a little bit
[01:23.680 --> 01:34.120]  at the cloud topic open shift is like a cloud on a cloud before that I worked quite some time on
[01:34.120 --> 01:42.960]  AI on AI ops in the office of the CTO and the last thing that I did for two years now is imagining
[01:42.960 --> 01:50.720]  or revisiting open source now in the age of clouds and seeing how open source principles
[01:50.720 --> 02:00.000]  can also apply to operations so we're going to look at the operate first community clouds why
[02:00.000 --> 02:09.240]  do we need a community of practice around operations what does the this community cloud
[02:09.240 --> 02:17.400]  look like and also where is it so I think this will be a it's not really a hands-on talk but you
[02:17.400 --> 02:25.520]  can take things away you can if Wi-Fi works for you you can log into the cloud right now and I hope
[02:25.520 --> 02:30.720]  to see you in some of the meetups or in the community after that because it's it's really open to
[02:30.720 --> 02:36.720]  anybody who wants to learn something about operations or wants to teach something about
[02:36.720 --> 02:47.000]  operations so when I first heard the term sovereign cloud like I said it sparked the sovereign the
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.880]  the king who has now also occupied the cloud and I put it into my favorite search engine and it
[02:55.880 --> 03:00.480]  immediately came up with a lot of definitions on sovereign cloud there was one from VMware some
[03:00.480 --> 03:06.680]  from telecom and they all looked at different aspects and these days in case you're not living
[03:06.680 --> 03:11.320]  under a rock everybody's talking about jet GPT so I thought maybe let's talk to this AI who
[03:11.320 --> 03:17.120]  already read all the definitions for me and ask it about them sovereign cloud and this is just
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.240]  the end of my conversation so I wanted to highlight the differences between the noun and
[03:22.240 --> 03:30.960]  the adjective sovereign and the noun sovereign refers to a personal identity that holds supreme
[03:30.960 --> 03:38.080]  power and authority while the adjective sovereign describes something that is supreme or superior
[03:38.080 --> 03:45.600]  in rank that still sounds not really friendly to me like I do I really want something that is in
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.400]  supreme power over me and why should I care about this then but is there also a notion of
[03:51.400 --> 03:56.760]  independence in that in that adjective because that's what I always thought about when thinking
[03:56.760 --> 04:05.040]  about it but a little bit and jet GPT came up with this that there's a notion of independence in
[04:05.040 --> 04:12.120]  the adjective to be described sovereign means to be independent not subject to control by any other
[04:12.120 --> 04:18.000]  person or entity which if you think about it that also implements if you have supreme power then
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.880]  you can also move away and having the highest degree of power and authority the term emphasizes
[04:24.880 --> 04:31.560]  the idea of self-governance and supreme power within a given context and the context seems to be
[04:31.560 --> 04:43.960]  cloud so when I look at sovereign cloud at least in my small world view it means I have the power
[04:43.960 --> 04:52.240]  to move away I have the power to control stuff and I have that that largest amount of independence
[04:52.240 --> 04:58.960]  and that seems at first contradictory to that business model that we saw in previous talks
[04:58.960 --> 05:06.520]  right so somebody a nice definition of cloud is I'm running stuff on somebody else's computers so
[05:06.520 --> 05:13.880]  that doesn't seem to be like a lot of freedom because I have some some lock-in but actually open
[05:13.880 --> 05:19.960]  source let a path away from lock-in so I think it's important that we apply these open source
[05:19.960 --> 05:28.640]  principle also to operations and if you these days look at a cloud is it is it really open I mean
[05:28.640 --> 05:37.840]  it's built on open source software you get your RDS or some some other product and underneath yes
[05:37.840 --> 05:43.080]  it's running MySQL that's running elastic it's running all that open source stuff but you're
[05:43.080 --> 05:51.840]  still tied to that to that experience that the cloud provider imposes on you if you want to
[05:51.840 --> 06:00.720]  rebuild that with open source solutions you can do it it's well it's looking pretty complicated so
[06:00.720 --> 06:04.680]  you need to master a lot of these technologies you need to stick them together and there's a
[06:04.680 --> 06:09.800]  reason for why people defer to the cloud because they are interested in the workload they just
[06:09.800 --> 06:17.480]  want to swap their credit card and consume and build away the applications so but I think the
[06:17.480 --> 06:25.400]  the last speaker put it really or the previous speaker put it really nice that login to be defined
[06:25.400 --> 06:37.520]  as a as a product of of cost and the likelihood that something is going away so you have to deal
[06:37.520 --> 06:46.480]  with that stuff but open source somehow if you go to this slide here so open source actually showed
[06:46.480 --> 06:54.920]  away out of this and the last the left side of that some funnel here is the traditional open source
[06:54.920 --> 07:02.360]  as in as in software contributions funnel which we all know for decades and which we all love so
[07:02.360 --> 07:13.880]  you find a project you use it there might be 100 users of it and at some point something breaks so
[07:13.880 --> 07:20.240]  you might file an issue great you already contributed because you file that issue and then
[07:20.240 --> 07:25.520]  maybe at the last time even somebody fixes or maybe you fix that project so there's really a
[07:25.520 --> 07:34.800]  funnel of 100 users then 10% reporting issues and making up that community and 1% actively
[07:34.800 --> 07:42.120]  contributing to that project if I'm using something as a service I'm essentially drowning this
[07:42.120 --> 07:53.560]  funnel so I'm I'm stopping at the at the API layer I might contribute to the underlying open
[07:53.560 --> 08:00.840]  source software that might run this service but in terms of contribution I'm usually I'm stuck
[08:00.840 --> 08:06.320]  with maybe filing in the support case and maybe the provider comes back to me but I have no
[08:06.320 --> 08:16.040]  possibility to actively contribute to that and maybe fix that API outage but maybe I'm the only
[08:16.040 --> 08:22.840]  person having that problem and so the cloud provider doesn't even care about this and this was the
[08:22.840 --> 08:31.600]  the notion that our team thought about when thinking about open source in the age of cloud where
[08:31.600 --> 08:39.880]  it's where there's more value apparently in running and providing the software then the
[08:39.880 --> 08:49.520]  software code itself or at least that's an unequal scale and as we see with many enterprise
[08:49.520 --> 08:58.520]  distributions or business models you can get the source code of that database or that service but
[08:58.520 --> 09:06.560]  you don't get the sometimes you don't even get the built tools you don't get the tools that
[09:06.560 --> 09:13.480]  actually operate that service the SLIs the metrics that you need to run there the runbooks etc so
[09:13.480 --> 09:21.560]  every deployment is either behind a paywall because that's the differentiating factor for
[09:21.560 --> 09:27.280]  that company or you have to learn it yourself and it's it's actually quite hard to open up
[09:27.280 --> 09:33.880]  something also with legal constraints right here so you may have might have proprietor
[09:33.880 --> 09:43.520]  PII personally identifiable information in in there you have logs so you need to make sure that
[09:43.520 --> 09:49.160]  you don't expose any of these secrets so that there's a tight balance and that's why most
[09:49.160 --> 09:57.640]  companies or most projects default to closed and even for even for communities that run their
[09:57.640 --> 10:04.000]  infrastructure like the Fedora infrastructure that's somewhat open but you still need to be
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.320]  going through a lot of hoops to to contribute and to do something so it's not really open by
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.520]  default and it's also not meant to be as a blueprint for something only 10 minutes left but I
[10:17.520 --> 10:25.240]  think I can go to the next part of this presentation so this is the this is the concept
[10:25.240 --> 10:31.960]  right so we need to shift left we need to open up operations and the practice something so that
[10:31.960 --> 10:38.280]  we build up a community so that we don't have to build our operational deployments from scratch
[10:38.280 --> 10:47.160]  and what that was is is the concept of this operate first idea we also thought you need to
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.240]  some have something physical something hands-on where people can actually contribute because
[10:51.240 --> 10:55.720]  otherwise it would be just a talk show so somebody needs to lead the way and implement that stuff
[10:55.720 --> 11:03.520]  and we tried to build a hybrid cloud with full visibility into the operation center and hybrid
[11:03.520 --> 11:14.720]  cloud these days is for a lot of people Kubernetes and so we have two bare metal Kubernetes
[11:14.720 --> 11:22.640]  clusters running at the Boston University with 34 nodes and 1200 cores so it's not a small
[11:22.640 --> 11:31.560]  setup then there's one larger cluster running in AWS from the OS climate project which is
[11:31.560 --> 11:38.120]  also managed with these operate first community cloud ideas and we also work with a German
[11:38.120 --> 11:47.200]  super scaler that's what the the layer between below a hyperscaler means Jonas they donated
[11:47.200 --> 11:53.160]  some hardware and we deployed also some some classes there so my vision actually is to to
[11:53.160 --> 12:01.400]  have a really resilient distributed clouds set up operated under these principles at as many
[12:01.400 --> 12:13.240]  hardware or cloud providers as possible 626 individuals locked into these into these clusters
[12:13.240 --> 12:22.880]  about 200 namespaces are there that's the so we do a lot of stuff on most of the stuff is
[12:22.880 --> 12:29.800]  happening on GitHub we have 150 people on the operate first in the operate first community
[12:29.800 --> 12:39.200]  there are like 1000 issues being filed the in terms of diversity it's since it's a red
[12:39.200 --> 12:45.560]  hats bootstrap project it's like one third or half of the people are red hat employees but
[12:45.560 --> 12:52.040]  there's also a lot of university contributions from American universities and also a lot of
[12:52.040 --> 12:59.880]  open source projects already contributing them it's just a highlight of some some of the
[12:59.880 --> 13:09.560]  more noteworthy projects using this infrastructure like OKD the upstream of OpenShift or OS climate
[13:09.560 --> 13:21.040]  or Janus IDP which is a project for for some backstage plugins so backstage if it's currently
[13:21.040 --> 13:31.560]  one of the one of the more hyped tools for a server developer portal by Spotify these
[13:31.560 --> 13:38.320]  are some of the services that are running there like the usual stuff that you would
[13:38.320 --> 13:44.720]  expect from a cloud setup we have Argo CD for doing GitOps we have Grafana for monitoring
[13:44.720 --> 13:51.120]  stuff we have tecton pipelines for building things there's a brow instance running for
[13:51.120 --> 13:57.360]  doing CI CD and a lot of other things so every and that's all deployed by the community
[13:57.360 --> 14:05.000]  in a GitHub repository where you can integrate into into these into these other services
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.400]  and I think that's where the actual value comes from so let's get real we love hands
[14:12.400 --> 14:22.360]  on keyboard and as I said it's all done via a really a GitOps SRE no a GitOps Git first
[14:22.360 --> 14:32.800]  approach the current entry point for you would be going to operate-first.cloud or and that
[14:32.800 --> 14:38.240]  click through some hoops and you end up at the service-catalog.operate-first.cloud which
[14:38.240 --> 14:48.840]  is an backstage instance where we for one showcase the services so you go to the catalog
[14:48.840 --> 14:54.960]  you see all these services with all their dependencies and you see all the managed clusters there
[14:54.960 --> 15:00.160]  so you click on one of these clusters and you are presented with a single single sign
[15:00.160 --> 15:05.960]  on logging screen and if you choose the second option operate-first you can lock in with
[15:05.960 --> 15:12.680]  your GitHub account so it's authenticated against GitHub and without even signing up
[15:12.680 --> 15:20.240]  for an account you get a read-only view of the cluster which is pretty awesome so you
[15:20.240 --> 15:24.760]  see how these these services are being deployed and how other community services are being
[15:24.760 --> 15:34.000]  deployed so you get a a a hello world example a live hello world example of a of of a fully
[15:34.000 --> 15:41.240]  production cloud environment which you would see at your at at your site either at your
[15:41.240 --> 15:52.040]  for your project or for your customer whatever and we documented the way and the why we came
[15:52.040 --> 15:57.880]  up to certain decisions so in this case it's application monitoring or there's also how
[15:57.880 --> 16:03.240]  to store credentials in a cloud and these are the the questions that you will face if
[16:03.240 --> 16:10.320]  you're setting up a your own local cloud and we documented these for con to bootstrap
[16:10.320 --> 16:15.560]  either other deployments or to contribute back so that you don't have to really read
[16:15.560 --> 16:23.680]  through so many blog posts and documentations and make your own choice there are some dashboards
[16:23.680 --> 16:28.440]  here and these are the dashboards that we use for troubleshooting or the community uses
[16:28.440 --> 16:36.800]  for troubleshooting so you would see Kafka or open data hub and Prometheus live dashboards
[16:36.800 --> 16:44.800]  and here's one dashboard for our for our clusters and that's the that's the github org where
[16:44.800 --> 16:54.760]  you would start talking to us or talking to the community the main entry repository is
[16:54.760 --> 17:00.520]  the support repository you can ask questions or you start with a one of these templates
[17:00.520 --> 17:10.520]  and one of the coolest templates here or processes is onboarding to a cluster so you get a form
[17:10.520 --> 17:15.440]  it looks like a form it's a github template you choose which cluster you want to be on
[17:15.440 --> 17:22.240]  boarded the team name and then we have some automation in place that would automatically
[17:22.240 --> 17:29.840]  create a pull request to our github repository and we only have to say looks good to me to
[17:29.840 --> 17:35.960]  it if you're for the person that's part of the operating team and they are onboarded
[17:35.960 --> 17:44.360]  so that's also giving giving you some sense of how would I automate my local clouds deployment
[17:44.360 --> 17:51.400]  you don't need to do that but it's it's it's a way to bootstrap you and there's a lot of
[17:51.400 --> 18:01.600]  other issues going on and as said it's a community so things will eventually also break right
[18:01.600 --> 18:08.280]  now we have problems with our object storage it's broken if you are an expert in nuba or
[18:08.280 --> 18:14.160]  in object storage and you want to get your hands dirty in rebuilding some of that stuff
[18:14.160 --> 18:20.720]  this is the issue so to me though here which will give another awesome talk at the end
[18:20.720 --> 18:28.880]  of this track here left some comments how to get started nobody worked on it yet so
[18:28.880 --> 18:30.520]  it's up for grabs thank you
[18:30.520 --> 18:50.960]  thanks myself question oh hey you provided a good definition for sovereign cloud who
[18:50.960 --> 18:59.640]  are the customers for sovereign cloud I don't know to be honest so I'm looking at it really
[18:59.640 --> 19:07.000]  from a technical perspective and I think my key takeaway is everybody who wants to build
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.480]  their own clouds probably wants to be sovereign in running their cloud and then you have to
[19:12.480 --> 19:17.720]  focus on stuff like minimizing vendor lock in and being able to move to another cloud
[19:17.720 --> 19:28.880]  provider or move your data across clouds to jump just on the question is one of the customer
[19:28.880 --> 19:33.800]  that would like a sovereign cloud because of the resiliency that we need to have because
[19:33.800 --> 19:40.880]  we have critical infrastructure I think that was a statement not a question right
[19:40.880 --> 19:54.880]  okay alright take out your smartphone snap that QR codes and there's a bi-weekly community
[19:54.880 --> 19:59.140]  meetup where you can meet all the wonderful people that are involved in this community
[19:59.140 --> 20:26.560]  where with
