{"text": " Hello everyone, we will talk about Kegami, about our corrections applications for Plasma Mobile and Plasma Desktop, so who I am, I'm a KD developer since 2018, I'm a member of the KD EV Foundation since 2019 and I started using the KD by basically like working on the website and the commutations and then I started doing applications. I worked with multiple Kegami applications, not to learn, for example Nailchart, Matrix Client, Contrast, Contrast Shaking applications, Tokodon, Muslim Client, Calendar, like it's like a calendar applications but also like there's a bit more fun calendar, for example contacts and soon emails and I am now like an hip-hop reader. I work at Kedab but she started three years ago before I worked at Nest Hub. So what is Kegami? Kegami is like a framework, you have to tweak it to basically like build project applications, it's written in QML, the QML is like a language delivery paper by Qt, it's a declarative language, basically like it's sort of mix of JSON and JavaScript and that's really good integration with C++, so you can always use C++ often. It was basically Kegami was developed to build mobile and applications in the Nokia times when Qt was updated by Nokia and that's why we are also using that for past mobile but also like to develop original applications not only for mobile but also for desktop. So yeah, basically how it works is that you have multiple pages, you can see like two pages, one of them is the list of emails and the second page with the content of the email. There's also like a driver concept, basically you can have things on the left and right, additional information, this is like a thing or it looks on the stock and on mobile you get only one page displayed at the right time, like you can see of two and only one, but it's quite the same UI, it's still like the same code but right and for the better, the drivers are also mobile friendly, so you can see on the left you have some of the collapses. Basically there's two ways to have page pages, either you put them in the column, like here, this page is for each of us, or you can as a layer on top of each of us and each page has some actions, you can basically add some buttons on the top, details if you want, but basically like how you build the key applications, you see like there's like a few concepts with the pages and the drivers and that basically of most of the key applications that they will put. For example, for shell applications like NeoChat, you only have two pages, one left for the list of users or sheds and one right with a few sheds, and yeah, it's as it looks, yeah. And basically like how Kigami started was 2015, we announced Plasma Mobile, but at that time we are still using the Plasma components, so basically the same components that we are using for the Plasma desktop, we are using them to create applications, but these are squeezing issues because first they got a look of Plasma applets as in applications, key applications, maybe as in the net convergence, so you are basically like to build applications for mobile and other applications for desktop, same for safety, there's a lot of duplications of efforts. So I try like one year later with Marco Matting, I'm a tinder of Kigami, created Kigami to basically only have to build one applications for both mobile and desktop, I mean this is like a long time ago, eight years ago, seven years ago, and then we tried to add more integration with the desktop because even at the beginning of the Kigami applications we are more like mobile applications still, so one of the things that we did first was like to create a team for the desktop called QQC2 desktop team, basically like critical controls, the framework that we are, the critical QML allows you to have teams that basically implement the features, so we have like a desktop team, what is, looks like a desktop applications, normal QQQ applications. When you're later, we did a lot of work as well as the colors, but they use the same colors and the desktop, as a Kigami application uses the same colors as normal QQQ applications. Before 2020, there was like almost no device that we could use Kigami, so the desktop was quite slow, because I mean there was Nexus 5, what kind of works with, but it was still small, old device that was slow, really slow, and yeah, when there was 2020, Pine 64 announced the Pine phone, and I think that really helped to get new contributors, and I mean as a way I started contributing to PlusNorway, it was a natural Pine phone, you add finally like a device that you could buy, and what supported Linux on, yeah, and last year, we also launched the Kigami add-ons, I will go more on to that later, yeah, basically like, at the recent times, we like felt it brought in new components, like for example, yes, the settings from Tocodon, the Mustang account, yeah, we worked for example, there was a new chat, there was a list to have a nice look, and again, the Tocodon settings, actually it's a mobile form components, but it allows to basically, mostly doing forms, but we are also using that for other stuff, basically display information, we are still a bit the idea of GNOME for that, because they look quite nice, and it allows basically like some comparisons of the forms, one of the last introductions, we added to Kigami, we are going to do this as a tree views, it's in calendars, it allows to do tree, display information as a tree, pretty useful for the task view in a calendar, where you can see the task and the task, yeah, another one last introduction that I created, what I contributed to is a search pop-up, it's a nice component, where you can basically have a search filled with a pop-up, but up here, when you click on it with the results, it's pretty nice, I think, with nice animations, but yeah, that's mostly it. Thank you very much, questions, comments, yeah, yeah, I was interested in how many devices support platform mobile, or most productive device to use platform mobile? Can you repeat? What kind of devices support platform mobile well? I mean there is a pine phone, a pine phone poor, that's like supporting it as well, when there's a basically platform mobile team doesn't really like do all the other implementations, we focus on the UI, because it's where we are quite good at, but the post-market OS folks, I mean, everything that's on post-market OS, for example, can run platform mobile, because it's basically like just a shell on top of post-market OS, or Manjaro, as a mobile edition, and there's like a lot of other small distributions, I think, open source as a mobile variant, and basically everything that's called mainline. The important thing is that it needs to be mainline support, we at the beginning supported other like, not mainline devices, but we had to stop that, because there's too much work to support both this sort of device and mainline, we had a lot of issues with telecommunications stack, because we had the LiboFono, what we were using, but it wasn't really working well for us, so we switched to a network mobile manager, but basically every device that runs mainline Linux would also run platform mobile, I mean, you can also run it on the desktop if you wanted, I wouldn't recommend that, but you can also do that. May I ask one more question, Isra, what is the long term of the platform mobile project, what's your goal? I mean, we have partnership with Pine 64, so they shipped personal phones, but it's quite hard to, I mean, Pine is no mainstream mobile manifesto as support for mainline Linux, and they're not really interested to support that, and they're not really interested to have something else run under it, because I mean, there's not enough applications, I mean, it's one of the issues, under its ecosystem has a lot of applications, we can actually like, there's a way to run applications on past mobile, but see like, yes, before we can maybe see like a, it's run on installed on our mainstream devices. I'm mostly focusing on applications, because that's the thing, it's a part where we are lacking the most native applications, I don't really do the pass-machel stuff. Other questions? Do you have some kind of support for progressive web apps? I think there is, as a browser, I think there is, does support, okay, see web app, you know, correctly, was implemented by Yonah a few years ago. Do you have any support for switching light mode and dark mode? Basically it's using the color shims API, but basically it works, so if you, in your chat it's implemented, you can basically switch on the color shims, but by default it just follows what the plasma colors are, so if you are, it's basically like we are trying to have the key applications that are quite new and not yet completely mature, to like hooks and have exactly like the older QT widget applications, so basically like if you change the colors, every application will change the colors, the QT widget one and the QT one. But you can as well implement, especially what one application should only be one team, one color, as possible. Yeah? Do you see more KD desktop applications being ported to Kirigami in the future? It's always like a bit of a controversial team, I'm, I've been with Calendar, I've been basically like, watching with Clodio, the entire PIM stack, all the KOOF applications, like Calendar, Mail, Contact, it's quite a bit of work, I think it's worth it because it looks a bit more nicer, but it's still like a lot of work to get it completely right, and I'm, what you really want is basically like, at least the Kirigami applications and the QT widget applications, because we can't get rid of all the QT widget applications and what everything looks the same, what they work the same, so when you interact with it, it should be like consistent. I mean, that's our goal, because we can't just go with everything in Kirigami. Thank you. No more? If not, then thank you very much. Yeah.
