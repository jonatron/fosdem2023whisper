The speaker, Koki Hammer from Toshiba Corporation, discussed the SW360 tool for managing software components and dependencies. While SW360 is capable of managing software information and registration of dependencies, it currently lacks flexibility in registering different dependencies for different projects. However, the speaker and their colleagues developed a new function to address this issue. They also mentioned the need for SW360 to correspond with common SCA standards like SPDX or Cyclone DX in the future. The Q&A session touched on topics such as handling dev dependencies and the ability to import/export SPDX files.
