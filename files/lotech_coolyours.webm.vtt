WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.240
So, I'm Pedro, Pedro Silva, and today we are going to look at how we can make collaboration

00:14.240 --> 00:21.600
online yours, and how those customizations can actually lead into new features, while

00:21.600 --> 00:25.520
going through some cool new features, why not?

00:25.520 --> 00:35.160
So, we start over with these different themes and different aspects that collaboration can

00:35.160 --> 00:42.520
have, but not only we can have these different faces, but we can also have different buttons.

00:42.520 --> 00:47.720
If you have a different button that you'd like to have, or maybe you are hacking on

00:47.720 --> 00:52.160
something and you want to have it in front of a button that triggers something, you can

00:52.160 --> 01:01.560
do that, and we'll show later how, but spoiler alert, you know, we have an XML file that

01:01.560 --> 01:07.680
you can customize it, we have a post message API that you can actually use that to hack

01:07.680 --> 01:16.560
directly onto the interface and beyond, and third of all, we also have some kind of cool

01:16.560 --> 01:22.840
variables that go through some invisible input field that then customize it.

01:22.840 --> 01:28.080
So, you know, there is a lot of stuff that you can just hack around.

01:28.080 --> 01:33.800
And by the way, language tool, as described by Michael Mix, thanks to Athenaeus, and we

01:33.800 --> 01:41.480
got this cool integration, file properties, another improved and now native functionality.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.560
You see here on this tab, there is plenty of space.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.360
You might want to add a button here.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
Why not?

01:47.360 --> 01:50.720
It's a good candidate to do that.

01:50.720 --> 01:54.760
Sparklines, accessibility check.

01:54.760 --> 02:01.280
We go through these new features, you know, how we can create diagrams.

02:01.280 --> 02:08.200
And you will soon start to feel that, okay, this is fitting my workflow, but maybe I want

02:08.200 --> 02:10.840
to go a step further.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.720
You know, by the way, we can even do this crazy stuff.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
Isn't it crazy?

02:14.720 --> 02:18.320
On a browser, I don't know, I think it's crazy.

02:18.320 --> 02:23.720
And while doing this, you know, we got a lot of performance whims left and right, which

02:23.720 --> 02:27.320
is, you know, it's cool and all, but what about new features?

02:27.320 --> 02:29.000
What about upcoming features?

02:29.000 --> 02:37.320
So, you know, we work with the LibreOffice technology around, in a group, with friends,

02:37.320 --> 02:43.440
and this means not only the people that are here, but even other people, you know, like

02:43.440 --> 02:45.840
for instance, in this case, next cloud.

02:45.840 --> 02:51.360
And we are just doing something that can start with online, then forces us to go to the core,

02:51.360 --> 02:55.920
to the LibreOffice kit, and in the process, we are improving both sides.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.280
So that's interesting.

02:58.280 --> 03:03.120
For instance, this is an example with form controls.

03:03.120 --> 03:10.200
As Miklos described, content controls, right?

03:10.200 --> 03:11.200
Repair documents.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.320
Repair improvements, but how do we make it, how we customize it?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.320
That's the question.

03:16.320 --> 03:21.800
So, as I hinted before, we can do that via XML, and there is a lot of variables that

03:21.800 --> 03:24.720
you can just turn on, turn off.

03:24.720 --> 03:30.280
We even saw it earlier with the PranamStalk, one of those examples.

03:30.280 --> 03:35.200
But you can set what's going to be the default UI mode.

03:35.200 --> 03:42.040
If you want to go a little bit further, you can hack what will be those key colors that

03:42.040 --> 03:49.560
we can see, and you see here the input values that we can pass.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.280
Or why not hack it directly into it?

03:52.280 --> 03:56.920
Maybe you have a different, you know, your native language is not English, and you might

03:56.920 --> 03:58.640
want to test it on that.

03:58.640 --> 04:03.960
You know, maybe you don't know, but you can add, you know, at the end of your URL, you

04:03.960 --> 04:12.200
can add this at the end lang, and for some different language directional layout, and

04:12.200 --> 04:16.440
you can test that, and maybe even help us, you know, translate.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.440
Why not?

04:17.440 --> 04:20.120
You can just go to the web late and just start to contribute.

04:20.120 --> 04:27.320
And you see, all those things are, you are making that yours, because it's answering

04:27.320 --> 04:30.600
your problem, but at the same time, you are helping everyone else.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.560
So I think that's the key here.

04:33.560 --> 04:38.640
You are inserting a new custom button, for this insert button, it's just one of the options

04:38.640 --> 04:43.400
that you can use and have used with the post message API.

04:43.400 --> 04:50.080
So if you go to sdk.coloronline.com, slash docs, slash post message API, you will see

04:50.080 --> 04:58.280
all these listed in the table with examples, so you can just hack it, you know, and have

04:58.280 --> 04:59.400
fun with it.

04:59.400 --> 05:05.200
You know, even if it doesn't work out of the box, even if you are trying to hack something

05:05.200 --> 05:07.080
and it breaks, it's okay.

05:07.080 --> 05:13.560
You know, you can always keep in touch, you can go to cola slash io, and there is there,

05:13.560 --> 05:18.440
you know, our IRC, our matrix, telegram, all these things.

05:18.440 --> 05:23.480
You can report bugs, you know, and maybe push a PR, you know, and you will find out that

05:23.480 --> 05:30.400
maybe your PR will lead to learn more about LibreOffice, technology LibreOffice kit, and

05:30.400 --> 05:37.560
suddenly you already have two PRs, both on cola online and on Garret on LibreOffice.

05:37.560 --> 05:42.000
So hopefully it's what will happen.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.680
You know, and while doing that, you have three minutes, questions, yes, and while you are

05:46.680 --> 05:52.640
doing that, you will be able to experiment crazy new features, the bleeding edge that

05:52.640 --> 05:55.800
still no one knows about it because you build it.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.560
So you know, maybe you can already see what is happening there, what's the new features,

06:00.560 --> 06:06.920
new integration that's coming, heat on citations, but many more things, yeah.

06:06.920 --> 06:15.000
So I hope you take it at heart and give it a go, and you know, join the team.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Thanks.

06:16.000 --> 06:24.880
Thank you.

06:24.880 --> 06:25.880
Any questions?

06:25.880 --> 06:30.160
We've got some, two and a half minutes.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.840
Thank you.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
Thank you.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.280
I use colabora on my next cloud.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.920
Can I do all this on my next cloud?

06:39.920 --> 06:40.920
Yes.

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
Why not?

06:41.920 --> 06:49.560
Yes, if you have your bill environment, you can hack all these things and have it.

06:49.560 --> 06:54.600
Now, if you have a production environment, that's probably what you are hitting at, okay,

06:54.600 --> 07:02.640
then you can still do some of these customizations just by simply hacking on the cool wst.xml,

07:02.640 --> 07:08.920
that it should be under ATC directory and you should find there, cool wst.xml.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.880
And you can, for instance, set up the default UI, what will be the default UI that will

07:12.880 --> 07:17.960
appear, you know, if you want to allow, if you want to use the integrators theme or not,

07:17.960 --> 07:23.800
for instance, if you are using the next cloud, next cloud has its own theme, so you can hack

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800
all these things.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.120
What's the default language?

07:27.120 --> 07:31.680
Maybe you have like three or four languages there, as a list, and maybe you don't need.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.720
Maybe you just use like maybe two, Portuguese or English or something, and both, too, and

07:35.720 --> 07:39.400
you can remove the others and it will maybe use less resources.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.800
So you know, there is a lot of things you can hack.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.800
We'll do.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.800
Thank you.

07:43.800 --> 07:49.480
30 seconds, one very quick question and answer.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.360
If not, go for the matrix chat.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.360
Thank you.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.360
Okay, thanks.

07:54.360 --> 08:09.280
Alright, thank you.

08:09.280 --> 08:15.800
Thank you.

08:15.800 --> 08:23.320
Thank you.
