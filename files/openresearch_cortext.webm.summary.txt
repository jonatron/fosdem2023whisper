The talk discusses the Cortex platform, an open platform for research in social sciences. The platform is designed to help social scientists find computational methods to answer specific research questions. It was founded in 2009 and has since grown with over 250 peer-reviewed publications and 50,000 analyses conducted by researchers from over 400 institutions in 50 countries. The platform is built on open source software and is gradually transitioning to become fully open source. The talk also touches on the challenges of citing software and the need for a permanent identifier for software objects. The presenters discuss their efforts to open source the platform and highlight some of the challenges faced in the process. They also express a desire to exchange knowledge with others facing similar challenges.
