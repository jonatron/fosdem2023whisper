The talk is about CNI automatic and its use in semantic network attachment in Kubernetes. The speaker discusses a problem statement where Kubernetes users face issues with uniformity and legacy systems, resulting in non-matching CNI configurations. As a solution, the speaker introduces Surveyor CNI, which maps devices to network names using custom resource definitions. While the tool is a proof of concept, it needs an engine to scale on non-uniform environments and device plugins to schedule workload nodes that have the particular devices. The speaker also highlights the need for CNI 2.0 to have more Kubernetes awareness. The talk ends with a Q&A session where the audience members propose suggestions such as Link Layer Discovery Protocol and multi-casting.
