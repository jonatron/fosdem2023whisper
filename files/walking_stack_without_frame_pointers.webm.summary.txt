The talk discusses the implementation of a stack walker for eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) without the use of frame pointers. The speakers explain the need for this implementation in profiling and gathering stack traces, as well as the limitations of existing methods. They then describe the design and implementation of their stack walker using .eh_frame and BPF maps. They also discuss performance considerations and future plans for the project.
