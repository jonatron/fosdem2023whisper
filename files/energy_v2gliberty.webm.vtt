WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
shortly about us so I'm there on the left so we are site our energy flexibility

00:16.000 --> 00:23.920
software startup who decided to go the open source way two years ago and this

00:23.920 --> 00:27.960
project we're working together with positive design small company in the

00:27.960 --> 00:34.680
Netherlands as well they are more working on the UX part of this so something

00:34.680 --> 00:38.120
where I really know a lot about are these two projects because we are

00:38.120 --> 00:43.640
building flex measures project we denote donated to the Linux Energy

00:43.640 --> 00:51.240
Foundation before you leave the room get some swag over there and together we

00:51.240 --> 00:56.840
built this V2G Liberty project which actually is works as an umbrella for the

00:56.840 --> 01:02.240
rest so vehicle to grid some of you might know roughly what it is it has

01:02.240 --> 01:08.280
been a buzzword going around it basically means other than most of the car

01:08.280 --> 01:12.760
charging that's going on today just power into the car you could actually get

01:12.760 --> 01:18.200
power out of the car for instance back onto the grid here I listed some use

01:18.200 --> 01:25.480
cases why that is supposedly a good idea and specifically the the third one

01:25.480 --> 01:29.560
that might be pretty interesting because in a scenario where you have a

01:29.560 --> 01:38.200
varying energy price now your car could be a trader right and actually the

01:38.200 --> 01:44.240
spreads in the energy markets are increasing by a lot these days it makes

01:44.240 --> 01:50.080
it suddenly interesting and when I look at industry coming up with vehicle to

01:50.080 --> 01:57.920
grid by themselves people observe a lot of delays and I from my perspective it

01:57.920 --> 02:02.760
seems that the the the actual industry players closed source players are looking

02:02.760 --> 02:07.120
to actually deliver an ecosystem right so these are pictures you're getting from

02:07.120 --> 02:11.560
the big names Hyundai Volkswagen Tesla they're always thinking about putting

02:11.560 --> 02:17.640
multiple things in your home basically taking it over and that takes longer and

02:17.640 --> 02:25.080
so something I'm not looking forward to that's why we decided to do this project

02:25.080 --> 02:31.040
it's more than a year ago now so we have more than a year of data from one

02:31.040 --> 02:35.880
location and recently we've attracted some other enthusiasts and there's five

02:35.880 --> 02:42.920
more locations where this is being employed in reality and quickly about

02:42.920 --> 02:46.600
the motivation so why should we do that is this something that I want to you know

02:46.600 --> 02:53.000
sell it was site energy flexibility and focus on that completely actually probably

02:53.000 --> 02:59.320
not site energy flexibility in our flex measures project is about making the

02:59.320 --> 03:04.400
best use of energy flexibility in general but this is very cool to show

03:04.400 --> 03:09.160
that we can do something today we don't have to wait or there's open source

03:09.160 --> 03:13.880
projects if you put them together are super powerful and it was a great way

03:13.880 --> 03:19.720
to bootstrap ourselves to challenge our technology so I'll talk about the stack

03:19.720 --> 03:25.080
the design of what V2G Liberty looks like if you use it and some outlooks

03:25.080 --> 03:32.480
first what do you need in this context to actually get going you won't find a

03:32.480 --> 03:36.960
lot of cars you can use for this the Nissan Leaf is one of the only ones

03:36.960 --> 03:42.600
specifically in 2021 that could do vehicle to grid same goes for the

03:42.600 --> 03:48.920
charger so this is a charger from Spanish company wallbox of course they

03:48.920 --> 03:55.360
promised that open standards like OCPP will be very soon working and that

03:55.360 --> 04:00.120
hasn't happened yet so what was it is you need some kind of computer in your

04:00.120 --> 04:06.720
house this has been mentioned in talks this morning already and then we work

04:06.720 --> 04:11.520
with an energy contract with dynamic tariffs so in the Netherlands that you

04:11.520 --> 04:15.040
already have I think six or seven to choose from that's going very hard but

04:15.040 --> 04:21.120
the tipper for instance is launching in a couple European countries and offers

04:21.120 --> 04:29.440
you that so this is actually the software architecture in a nutshell I don't

04:29.440 --> 04:35.400
want to make it too difficult if you imagine you put this in your house what

04:35.400 --> 04:42.480
you need is to install home assistant so that's this logo here home assistant is

04:42.480 --> 04:48.000
a very stable home automation software and we've basically built V2G Liberty

04:48.000 --> 04:53.840
as a home assistant plug-in that's also actually fun to do it's it's it's nice

04:53.840 --> 05:02.440
and you get a lot of presence like UI widgets and things like that and then

05:02.440 --> 05:08.680
flex measures is actually not running in the house it could it's dockerized you

05:08.680 --> 05:13.040
could put it in the house next to your home automation software and I think a

05:13.040 --> 05:19.360
couple of these enthusiasts who now are using this are doing that but for such a

05:19.360 --> 05:22.840
software it's sometimes nicer to run in the cloud because it's more difficult to

05:22.840 --> 05:31.560
maintain flex measures itself is then responsible to get the relevant real-time

05:31.560 --> 05:36.520
data that's it's important to schedule the cars charging this charging so in

05:36.520 --> 05:44.960
this case the prices that the consumer contract is on we could also get I think

05:44.960 --> 05:49.440
we actually do in a new version it's not listed here we also get some public

05:49.440 --> 05:54.480
data that helps us to look at the co2 levels of your car cost consumption so

05:54.480 --> 06:01.760
there will be another box right there and I talked about this connection right

06:01.760 --> 06:07.000
so we have to somehow talk to the wallbox and we found out for now this

06:07.000 --> 06:12.560
has to be modbus and we found out to how this response and we talked to the

06:12.560 --> 06:17.760
company the wallbox company if we're allowed to put our code in a public

06:17.760 --> 06:22.600
repository if you could see in the code which registers their hardware reacts to

06:22.600 --> 06:29.200
but I think yeah we've sorted it out that was a bit difficult and basically

06:29.200 --> 06:35.440
what we have to do is simply say start or stop the charge or discharging and we

06:35.440 --> 06:40.960
are able to read the state of charge of the battery and on the left side are

06:40.960 --> 06:48.520
some more nicer UX features so you want to put along for a longer ride you want

06:48.520 --> 06:53.080
to tell our system that the car needs to be full and maybe you want some

06:53.080 --> 06:59.720
overrides I'll come to those later so first about the components I I mentioned

06:59.720 --> 07:06.200
home assistant it has been around for a while now I think it has also some

07:06.200 --> 07:13.200
origins in the Netherlands but it's also developed in California now actually

07:13.200 --> 07:19.240
we had a couple of the home assistant people over in a demo because these

07:19.240 --> 07:25.600
people here so that was nice to actually have that also in real life and as I

07:25.600 --> 07:30.120
said you can write plugins to really to do your own logic on top of a home

07:30.120 --> 07:34.880
assistant now thanks measures is the project that I spent the most time with

07:34.880 --> 07:43.120
our company develops that yeah basically it's a data driven platform to get the

07:43.120 --> 07:51.160
best timing for your flexible energy assets when should they be on or off so

07:51.160 --> 07:56.160
and what I'm talking to you today about is an immobility project but we've also

07:56.160 --> 08:01.400
having some commercial projects in industry the built environment and

08:01.400 --> 08:08.120
actually our goal our dream is that this all comes together so for example we're

08:08.120 --> 08:13.080
working on heating now the energy flexibility of heating and heating and

08:13.080 --> 08:18.000
immobility somehow happen right next to each other so that's where we want to

08:18.000 --> 08:27.120
go and flex measures itself has a UI and I'm just showcasing that here but in

08:27.120 --> 08:30.560
our project right now in this V2G Liberty project that wasn't really being

08:30.560 --> 08:36.160
used so what we want is for flex measures to be a back-end that you talk to

08:36.160 --> 08:42.000
through APIs and you built your you usually built your own user interfacing

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
flexible service or you integrate what flex measures helps you with into your

08:47.000 --> 08:53.920
existing service well that's actually what we did with V2G Liberty so that's

08:53.920 --> 09:00.880
actually a kind of typical home assistant look for your dashboard I think we

09:00.880 --> 09:08.120
have the goal to bring our own style into that when we have the help but that's

09:08.120 --> 09:12.920
what you get and yeah usually you can see what your car is doing what's the

09:12.920 --> 09:18.080
charging power right now what's the state of charge and then we come into the

09:18.080 --> 09:25.840
more interesting or self-built features I will talk about this in another slide

09:25.840 --> 09:31.480
but this basically shows you the state of charge that happened in blue and what

09:31.480 --> 09:37.000
flex measures has advised to happen with that in the upcoming hours and the

09:37.000 --> 09:43.040
energy price and here you have you have the ability as a user to simply say I

09:43.040 --> 09:51.640
don't want this stop the automation or just charge the car right now I don't

09:51.640 --> 10:00.200
care about the optimal result here you see if you've reserved the car and that's

10:00.200 --> 10:06.880
where our partner positive design came in to really think with us well it

10:06.880 --> 10:12.160
if we get to design a V2G application what do we want to experience when we

10:12.160 --> 10:19.200
use it and these are the goals it should basically you want to be happy that

10:19.200 --> 10:23.600
it's there for a few weeks but then you want to stop thinking about it every

10:23.600 --> 10:29.880
day it should just happen and you might look at your end result and be happy it

10:29.880 --> 10:35.280
of course needs to be ready for you to do trips at least trips let's say

10:35.280 --> 10:41.160
groceries hospital go to a nearby town which in the Netherlands of course is

10:41.160 --> 10:47.880
quite easy so Utrecht Amsterdam for instance works with 20 percent of

10:47.880 --> 10:56.280
charge yeah and CO2 saving and cost saving of course other the goals you

10:56.280 --> 11:04.400
can really put numbers on yeah let's let's go one level deeper in the detail

11:04.400 --> 11:09.320
here I'm not sure it was all clear I always said the state of charge history

11:09.320 --> 11:14.360
will be shown to you in blue and then it's shown to you what the planning

11:14.360 --> 11:20.960
would be so here you can see a bit if you look at the price in gray that in

11:20.960 --> 11:24.920
the future you will charge your battery because the price is low and you will

11:24.920 --> 11:29.600
discharge because there's a higher price later and you do that twice actually in

11:29.600 --> 11:36.760
that in that day and the new feature as I said earlier is that we also plotting

11:36.760 --> 11:44.360
the CO2 intensity on the grid that's going to happen in those hours that's

11:44.360 --> 11:51.680
something we are basing on the scheduled coal and gas power for the

11:51.680 --> 11:55.800
upcoming days of course there's also professional services for that somebody

11:55.800 --> 12:00.880
in an earlier talk mentioned electricity map I think that's in the

12:00.880 --> 12:06.960
capital tool that's a third-party integration for cost reasons we

12:06.960 --> 12:13.440
basically developed our own version of that and what's interesting of course

12:13.440 --> 12:19.960
as you see there's a slight correlation and we actually have a plot

12:19.960 --> 12:24.440
somewhere where we looked at the whole here from our data and checked so is

12:24.440 --> 12:30.080
low carbon intensity does that kind of correlate to lower prices because in

12:30.080 --> 12:35.040
that moment you have a lot of sun and wind on the grid which have zero marginal

12:35.040 --> 12:41.520
cost so that can happen and in the day ahead prices of course that's there's

12:41.520 --> 12:47.240
an economics that makes that complex but it does actually happen during the day

12:47.240 --> 12:57.240
during the day you see a correlation in the night not yet so here's one or two

12:57.240 --> 13:01.960
features of this application in V2G Liberty for instance you come home

13:01.960 --> 13:11.360
from some trip you connect the car V2G Liberty talks to the charger and asks

13:11.360 --> 13:14.200
so what's the deal with the car right now what is the state of charge it comes

13:14.200 --> 13:20.520
back as below 20% and then there's only one cause of action we have to get up

13:20.520 --> 13:30.560
back to those 20% so that's just a simple fallback that gets you to 60 to 80

13:30.560 --> 13:36.760
kilometers and and when you've outlived your range anxiety that should be okay

13:36.760 --> 13:44.120
and that other feature I've shown in the UI before as well you can go to

13:44.120 --> 13:48.520
your calendar on your phone and that's where NextCloud comes in here now I

13:48.520 --> 13:53.560
I'm a personal on also the company where NextCloud users and that's why I was so

13:53.560 --> 13:58.560
happy to bring NextCloud in this as well but it's basically just used for the

13:58.560 --> 14:03.560
agenda integration you can use Google Calendar if you need to that's no problem

14:03.560 --> 14:09.880
so you make your own agenda for your car and you create an entry in the agenda

14:09.880 --> 14:13.600
for your car that you're going on a longer on a road trip let's say tomorrow

14:13.600 --> 14:20.320
at 8 o'clock and that will be picked up by V2G Liberty and what's nice here you

14:20.320 --> 14:25.280
see here the mobile view I showed the desktop view before but Home Assistant

14:25.280 --> 14:31.200
even gives you something that looks really well on your mobile mobile app

14:31.200 --> 14:39.720
which is this is basically the same widgets just rearranged so then this

14:39.720 --> 14:44.640
will show up home V2G Liberty will know about that reservation will contact

14:44.640 --> 14:48.600
flex measures automatically flex measures will realize oh there's a new

14:48.600 --> 14:53.080
constraint coming in I need to recompute everything and that will change so here

14:53.080 --> 14:59.720
you see state of charge will go up to a hundred try trying to avoid that price

14:59.720 --> 15:04.960
peak there in the middle do it cost efficiently

15:04.960 --> 15:15.280
all right so where are we now this project so it's working nice first thing

15:15.280 --> 15:20.360
that comes to mind now that we're the other enthusiasts being on board that the

15:20.360 --> 15:25.960
installation effort still a bit high you you know we have written it all out on

15:25.960 --> 15:33.520
that V2G Liberty GitHub read me but as a couple steps you need to install your

15:33.520 --> 15:37.000
Home Assistant and make that plug-in work so there we can have some low-hanging

15:37.000 --> 15:40.960
fruits in Home Assistant you can basically have an actual plug-in that

15:40.960 --> 15:45.880
is downloadable and updates itself and all that you do have configurations to

15:45.880 --> 15:52.960
make in a file that could be a wizard this there's some stuff there it really

15:52.960 --> 15:56.640
helps us also with flex measures to see if it runs in the background like what

15:56.640 --> 16:01.880
kind of monitoring do we need it's really helpful some people are installing

16:01.880 --> 16:06.560
flex measures themselves as well so that's really and you really a techie

16:06.560 --> 16:14.600
enthusiast I will briefly go into some earnings or

16:14.600 --> 16:19.520
economical results so here's some hints that you know sometimes you have a day

16:19.520 --> 16:25.720
where there's there was huge sprite price spreads and your car basically set at

16:25.720 --> 16:30.640
home the whole day and then you can really have a great day with earnings

16:30.640 --> 16:37.120
above the 10 euros in the Netherlands good to keep in mind energy flexibility

16:37.120 --> 16:45.440
is only usable if your asset is there and you're not using it so if you take

16:45.440 --> 16:51.320
your car for long rides every day well there's less time to do something with

16:51.320 --> 17:00.320
it and then you have less earnings excuse me so actually this user is making a

17:00.320 --> 17:08.720
lot of kilometers actually and so here's a report from I think this is ten

17:08.720 --> 17:16.280
months of data and this is an overview we will see how much has been charged and

17:16.280 --> 17:22.880
discharged right so this is actually large parts of these of these kilowatt

17:22.880 --> 17:29.760
hours have actually been charged just to save them and give them back to the

17:29.760 --> 17:39.480
grid at a better time this is what where a lot of policymakers put high hopes

17:39.480 --> 17:46.680
on of course that cars will work as batteries so that the grid can use and

17:46.680 --> 17:53.160
carry energy at the best times well there's a big axle spreadsheet behind

17:53.160 --> 17:59.560
this but if you just look at the the bottom line that you would see they

17:59.560 --> 18:05.520
have driven their car for 3,000 kilowatt hours and paid 200 euros for that

18:05.520 --> 18:12.000
it's a pretty good price and you could compare with scenarios so what if what

18:12.000 --> 18:18.760
if I had just a fixed cost contract from a year ago would you wouldn't get that

18:18.760 --> 18:24.480
today you can you arrive at some price as you all know this changes these

18:24.480 --> 18:28.840
numbers they change so fast these days and you got before the Ukraine crisis

18:28.840 --> 18:35.040
already lots of movement in the markets after that more so this is this is

18:35.040 --> 18:40.760
difficult I think to make these look at these as hard facts like how many euros

18:40.760 --> 18:48.560
will I save if I install this in 2023 or 2024 I will not subscribe on the number

18:48.560 --> 18:52.120
there but their savings and there's some other people making these calculations

18:52.120 --> 18:56.520
also on a more higher level but it's nice to have an actual project you know

18:56.520 --> 19:01.880
this has really happened and we can dive deeper into the data so if anybody's

19:01.880 --> 19:09.280
interested let us know and of course another one a part of the cost is that

19:09.280 --> 19:15.040
the V2G capable chargers are currently much more expensive but I think the

19:15.040 --> 19:23.160
difference is coming down soon right so what we will do the installation I

19:23.160 --> 19:31.240
already mentioned updating V2G Liberty if you have it running and we have a

19:31.240 --> 19:39.000
new version that that can be easier we want to actually show you KPIs you know

19:39.000 --> 19:46.800
what did I save in money or CO2 let's say last month I think per day can also

19:46.800 --> 19:54.480
work now we have more users enthusiasts who install it at home and we run it so

19:54.480 --> 19:58.440
will the learning curve is going up right now in a sense of how much

19:58.440 --> 20:03.720
information we get that's great and there's it's going to be an interesting

20:03.720 --> 20:11.800
year with more things to support I'm not sure what kind of things this project

20:11.800 --> 20:21.080
should support the V2G Liberty project it potentially has to do with demand from

20:21.080 --> 20:26.640
the community but of course if you if chargers actually support OCPP then

20:26.640 --> 20:32.040
that's just a great idea and on the flex measure side so that's something I

20:32.040 --> 20:40.680
also know the the near future a bit I already mentioned that we are tackling

20:40.680 --> 20:46.320
immobility in projects like this but also heat in other projects and we look

20:46.320 --> 20:51.480
at the build environment this has to come together so our our big next

20:51.480 --> 20:58.920
challenge is to really model the energy flexibility from these two usages of

20:58.920 --> 21:05.000
energy combined and and give one make one computation about a building or a

21:05.000 --> 21:12.120
site that uses heat and uses immobility as two big flexible power demands and

21:12.120 --> 21:18.200
and come up with one optimization and then actually automate that so that's

21:18.200 --> 21:25.800
that's our next big milestone and the other thing that's really important of

21:25.800 --> 21:32.960
course to mention is network congestion that's network operators are coming up

21:32.960 --> 21:40.640
with ideas how projects like this are flexible consumers can do their part so

21:40.640 --> 21:45.240
for instance can stop their demands in a specific moment and in a specific region

21:45.240 --> 21:52.200
which would help on the lower and medium parts of the grid and that's also for us

21:52.200 --> 22:02.440
really on the map this is almost at the end of course we need to hear

22:02.440 --> 22:07.600
questions but of course to for people to get in contact and I'm just listening

22:07.600 --> 22:12.920
to the best contact points for each of the projects for V2G liberty that's

22:12.920 --> 22:20.880
just come to the GitHub project and interact there flex measures itself is

22:20.880 --> 22:27.880
has more channels that you can contact us on we listed them here in the in the

22:27.880 --> 22:35.720
read the docs for instance through LF energy their ways I do have I think I

22:35.720 --> 22:42.120
have two minutes so one thing I have on the very last slide before I close is

22:42.120 --> 22:46.960
something we build in flex measures recently because if you talk about

22:46.960 --> 22:51.160
projects like these basically after they happen and you just summarizing what

22:51.160 --> 22:55.840
happened they don't really come alive because what actually happens and what

22:55.840 --> 23:01.840
we do is that throughout the day new situations arise all the time you know

23:01.840 --> 23:07.040
new circumstances like the car comes back it has a completely new state of

23:07.040 --> 23:13.080
charge could be lower maybe they charged on the way is higher you don't know this

23:13.080 --> 23:21.480
this is a new situation so we need to recompute and each of these situations

23:21.480 --> 23:26.280
you also need to have a different set of forecasts so you ask yourself it's this

23:26.280 --> 23:33.080
point in time I was asked to recompute and I look at the set of forecasts what

23:33.080 --> 23:38.120
do I know now about the state of things so maybe not all the devices have sent

23:38.120 --> 23:43.720
me everything yet there's always delays there's always lags in IOT applications

23:43.720 --> 23:48.680
in the future which forecast do I have now available and that's what I mean

23:48.680 --> 23:57.440
with it doesn't come alive right and we let's see if it works yeah we we made it

23:57.440 --> 24:02.840
we made a UI that uses JavaScript so you can travel through time basically so

24:02.840 --> 24:08.520
imagine that that bar is now you hit that button and we have kept the old

24:08.520 --> 24:12.560
schedules we have kept everything that's all and we know when we knew it

24:12.560 --> 24:18.160
that's how we can travel through time and when we stop it anywhere we know

24:18.160 --> 24:23.560
what we knew at the time so let's say we knew the day ahead prices you can see

24:23.560 --> 24:27.880
the day head price on top coming in in batches for instance and then the new

24:27.880 --> 24:37.760
schedules that's a red dotted line also all right let me stop in time and there's

24:37.760 --> 24:45.600
any questions all right there's a few but who decides on the order well let's

24:45.600 --> 25:04.200
just start my left I think that V2d liberty oh yeah sure the question was

25:04.200 --> 25:11.000
if this has been built for one car or if there's the opportunity to have multiple

25:11.000 --> 25:18.720
cars at the same location on the charging station supported and V2d liberty

25:18.720 --> 25:24.440
has right now been built for one household with one car which is expandable

25:24.440 --> 25:30.800
in principle through some work and flex measures itself has a solver that could

25:30.800 --> 25:48.480
also schedule multiple cars so that's not a technical problem on that side

26:00.800 --> 26:27.960
so the question is that for the day head prices the energy suppliers make a

26:27.960 --> 26:34.160
forecast usually or traditionally what all the consumers will consume aggregated

26:34.160 --> 26:38.200
over thousands of consumers they get a nice curve and they try to buy that now

26:38.200 --> 26:43.080
if the consumers react to that price you have a loop somehow a dynamics more

26:43.080 --> 26:50.200
dynamic system and the question was if I have thought about it yes of course it's

26:50.200 --> 26:54.520
super interesting there's two thoughts one is that there's now a couple of

26:54.520 --> 26:59.840
providers like that in the Netherlands and I think they basically adjust for

26:59.840 --> 27:06.760
that they would assume that a bunch of their customers do act flexible and

27:06.760 --> 27:11.000
they might have have to add a model for that a behavioral model economics

27:11.000 --> 27:17.520
economics behavioral and try to get it right on the other hand I think that some

27:17.520 --> 27:22.720
there's going to be more energy suppliers because I know of a company

27:22.720 --> 27:27.400
in the Netherlands that is basically helping larger companies become an

27:27.400 --> 27:31.840
energy supplier so they don't if it's basically energy supply as a service so

27:31.840 --> 27:37.280
you can brand your own energy supply contract and some of organizations I've

27:37.280 --> 27:43.560
talked to think about adjusting their their price signal themselves so they

27:43.560 --> 27:47.200
buy something on the day head market but that's not the price they give to you

27:47.200 --> 27:53.160
they give you a different profile to try to sort that out

28:03.600 --> 28:08.840
yeah could be could be that you're not doing as much money on the market but

28:08.840 --> 28:35.200
now you add services I was talking about hardware so can you repeat the

28:35.200 --> 28:53.440
question do you mean the Everest project yes well we are both in Linux

28:53.440 --> 28:59.320
energy foundation so we know about each other so that would be a way out the

28:59.320 --> 29:09.440
question right it's everything's super new and the question was for the

29:09.440 --> 29:15.320
audience online that there's the Everest project and they also have open source

29:15.320 --> 29:20.200
hardware although that's not there the core of the the company but they offer

29:20.200 --> 29:24.480
that and they had a great talk this morning so that could help of course so

29:24.480 --> 29:29.040
that's it's a great opportunity for the community for anybody maybe for us to

29:29.040 --> 29:35.800
combine these two I don't know but especially young companies have to

29:35.800 --> 29:45.280
sprint it's difficult I want to also get some part of the we are fine I'll be

29:45.280 --> 29:48.880
answering questions in the chat if there's something burning or right now in

29:48.880 --> 30:01.000
person afterwards in the break thank you
