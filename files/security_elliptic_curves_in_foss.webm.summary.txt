This talk discussed standardizing elliptic curves and the implications of doing so in free and open source software. It also discussed newer technologies such as zero-knowledge, homomorphic encryption, MPC, and VDFs, as well as comparison to existing standards. Finally, it touched on Jacobi Quartik curves, as they might provide faster and smaller signatures, alongside hyper elliptic curves which banks are researching.
