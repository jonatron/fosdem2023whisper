 this community cloud and other open source things from from operational perspective okay all right thank

In this talk, the speaker discussed the concept of operating a "sovereign cloud," which is about having the power and authority to move away and have the highest degree of power and authority when running a cloud. The speaker discussed how applying open source principles can help reduce the risk of lock-in when running a cloud, and shared a few projects that demonstrate the idea of an "operate-first community cloud". Operating such a cloud means hosting services with full visibility into the operations, and allows people to contribute to it using a GitOps SRE approach.
