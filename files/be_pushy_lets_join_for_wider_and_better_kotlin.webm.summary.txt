The speaker begins by discussing the importance of advocacy and pushing for wider support for Kotlin. They explain that in order to do this, developers can plant seeds by introducing others to Kotlin and suggesting its use, water the plants by providing ongoing support and training, find and train new advocates, and lobby for Kotlin by engaging with online communities, suggesting improvements, and collaborating on open-source projects. The speaker encourages developers to think beyond the Kotlin circle and target different communities, such as beginners, students, web developers, data scientists, iOS developers, etc. They emphasize the importance of being context-relevant and adapting their approach to the target audience. The speaker also suggests sharing one's experiences, technical facts about Kotlin and its ecosystem, and staying up-to-date with the latest Kotlin news. They discuss ways to act as a leader within organizations, such as suggesting the use of Kotlin for new projects and helping teammates master Kotlin. The speaker concludes by reminding developers that advocating for Kotlin may take time and encourages them to be patient and to always be nice and considerate in their approach.
