In this talk, Ludwig Dubost, the creator of XWiki, discusses the progress and challenges faced by alternatives to big tech companies in the free and open-source software (FOSS) space. He emphasizes the importance of end-user apps and the difficulties faced by companies like his in competing with big tech. He also highlights the need for European companies to work together and collaborate more, as well as the importance of digital sovereignty in a world dominated by American tech giants. Dubost discusses the current landscape of the tech sector, the imbalance in GDP between the US and Europe, and the challenges faced by European companies in the hardware, cloud services, platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS) sectors. He asserts that open source can help address some of these challenges, as it allows for cooperation, fosters open standards, and enables the development of local competence. Dubost mentions a number of European open source projects and companies in the collaboration, video conferencing, project management, authentication, email, file management, and chat spaces. He also discusses the challenges faced by open source businesses, including funding, integration, and partnerships with cloud providers. He suggests that open source companies should work with less cash, believe in themselves, collaborate more, and advocate for open standards. Dubost acknowledges the efforts of European initiatives like NGI and GAIAX, as well as the funding provided by some European governments. However, he points out the need for better coordination and support for open source software in Europe. In conclusion, Dubost emphasizes the importance of open source software in improving digital sovereignty and calls for more clients and partnerships to help advance the open source movement.
