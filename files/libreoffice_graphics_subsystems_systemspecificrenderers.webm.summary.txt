Armin Legrand gave a talk at FOSDEM conference in 2023 about his work on the graphic stack for the LibreOffice system-dependent primitive renderer. He implemented a prototype on Direct2D and it is feature complete, supporting all necessary primitives. It's in a single source file, fast, and recently added for users to try out. Legrand hopes to find resources to help add further support, such as text and direct support for gradients, and suggests continuing with system-dependent primitives or using a combination of solutions.
