WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm Daniel from the two-star platform in Europe, and I'm sitting over there, and I also work

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
with other projects like Detective, which we want to be an open-source solution to make

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
European public tendering data or public procurement data explorable for people who don't know

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
that much about the procurement data. So I want to do a couple of things in this talk.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
First, I want to describe why public procurement data is interesting, why we should take a look at it,

00:39.000 --> 00:48.000
and I want to discuss some problems of how this data in EU context is currently accessible.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
And then I want to show you our project of alleviating some of these problems with Detective.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
And then I want to show you how you can actually contribute to the project with your company.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
Still very much in the early stages, just getting going, and we love the opportunity to show this now

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
so we can actually contribute even in the earlier phase of the project.

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
So what's TET? TET's in the name, and what's TET? So TET stands for Tenders European Daily,

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
and it's basically a data set that's published by the EU Publications Office,

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
and they've published this data for a long time. They've been publishing this for a long time since 2015,

01:39.000 --> 01:49.000
actually, they've been providing this freely on the internet, and it's data about basically who buys what from whom,

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
like which public institutions in the EU buy what for what price from which organization.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
So it's really data about the relationship between business and government.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
And if, so for example your local school or some ministry in your country in the EU

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
wants to buy something that's of a certain threshold, they're defined in the EU legislation,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
you can look them up in the link here, I will upload the slides upwards.

02:15.000 --> 02:25.000
It needs to go into TET, and it will be in this data set, and there's at least 670 billion per year in value

02:25.000 --> 02:35.000
that's kind of encapsulated in this data, and there's more than 700,000 notices that they publish each year.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
They've described this entire process of public procurement in the EU.

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
It's very great that some of you want to join.

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
So you put things, well great, you publish it, so what's the problem with that?

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
I mean the way this data is made accessible is via this UI, one funny thing is,

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
one funny thing is, this button for statistics mode, I still haven't found out what that does,

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
like what that changes, maybe somebody from the EU can illuminate,

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
but basically you have to really know what you're searching for in the first place

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
in order to be able to use this kind of interface.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
And there's also a lot of other problems with accessing this data.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
For example, you can't really search by organization, which would be interesting.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
I mean it's about the relationship between government and business in all of the money terms.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
So why is there no option to search for organizations that I'm interested in?

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
I can only really do a full text search over these huge XML files, which are really complex.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
And I can do some other stuff, but there's no type of tolerance, for example,

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
none of the really nice search features that we can use to.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
And most importantly, there's no ability at all to readily visualize the results that I get.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
Like if I type something in here, in a search mask, I get back a list of HTML,

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
basically just an HTML list of notices, then I need to understand what's a notice

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
or the different types of notices that I'm interested in.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
So it's really hard.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
So it makes the test right, because accessibility is really bad with this data.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
So why is detective needed?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
In the past, there have been a number of attempts to look at this data

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
and transform it into a more manageable or readily analyzable format.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
And we weren't really able to identify a single, freely available solution

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
that was published under a free software license that allows you to explore this data

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
even if you don't have domain expertise or data science.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
And you kind of need both now to be able to make some sense of this data.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And we thought this would be interesting.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
So why isn't this more readily available?

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
So we applied to last year's EU Datathon with this idea, basically, to make this data more accessible.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And this is what we told them.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
So we have any type of, let's say we have a public servant

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
that wants to find out who buys what from, like, within their state.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Who buys from Microsoft, in Germany.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
And how much they spend on free software from this company.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
And yes, maybe make the case of how much they can save if they use free software instead.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
Or let's say you're a journalist who wants to investigate recent purchases made by Microsoft.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Or authority.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
You could do that now with a patent to face, but it would be very, very difficult.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
And you'd have to jump a lot of hurdles to get there.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
So we want to take it as to be an application that you use

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
which lowers the barrier of entry to analyze.

06:07.000 --> 06:15.000
So we thought let's present the publications of this concept with free software.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And keeping it very simple.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
So we built something roughly with this architecture.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
So you have this XML file.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
And this was very quickly built just for this Datathon.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So I'll go through it quickly.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So we had this XML file.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
I transformed it to JSON for whatever reason, which was a very bad idea.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
And I parsed it in Python and put it in some ad hoc schema in Postgres.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
And then I used the Neo4j ETL tool to put it to a Neo4j database.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
The data I was interested in was relational data between, and it shows the relationship between business and government.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
And then I used Neo-dash to visualize that.

06:55.000 --> 07:06.000
And that actually already gave people at PUD some chance to see what might be possible with you if you open up this data.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
So I'll show you the little demo of how that looked.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So basically this is just an overview.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I parsed data for roughly three years or two and a half years.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
This shows you the activity per country.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
This is just some general overviews, like roughly a million tenders.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And then it's not optimized yet.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
You basically search for Microsoft Germany and then you have this graph.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
You have a geographical distribution of commercial activity that's related to Microsoft.

07:40.000 --> 07:50.000
And you get this nice graph of relationships between Microsoft Germany here in the center as an entity.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And then the yellow or red ones are tenders.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
So here they sold something to some institution of German government in this case here.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Mostly because Microsoft Germany mostly sells to German government.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
And the red ones are tenders above one million euro.

08:10.000 --> 08:21.000
And that gave you a very quick overview of the commercial activity and the relationship between government entities and business entities.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
I do the same with you get more information here.

08:27.000 --> 08:35.000
You can actually go to the TED website to see the notice that analyzed this.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm searching for a short question.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
You search now for Microsoft, usually they work with like these server providers.

08:46.000 --> 08:57.000
Can we get back to the challenges that we face that you can overcome?

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
So here I do the same with the Polish order authority.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Here it's more like who there's an entity buys from over the past two and a half years.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
You can see what kind of like fence and weapon and ammunition stuff they bought.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
I'll get through this because this is actually another problem that I'll talk about towards the end of the talk.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
It's deduplication.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
So in TED data, as it's published in these Excel files, there's no deduplication of entities at all.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
So you can have Microsoft Deutschland, DMPH, Microsoft Deutschland, just Microsoft, whatever that is.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
And like you can see here, Microsoft Ireland, like there's all these different.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
So I did some very naive deduplication attempt.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
I also put that data in a new project graph, but there's much more to be done on that front.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
And it's a very interesting problem, I think.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Also because you need to think about it from a policy side as well.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Like is Microsoft Deutschland a different entity from Microsoft Ireland?

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
And if yes, what does that mean for my data analysis?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Should I analyze them together?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Because they're really operating as one entity.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
So they're interesting questions connected to this that are not only technical.

10:12.000 --> 10:24.000
So let's go back to my...

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
So that was obviously limited in scope, because it was really ad hoc.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
It was quickly made, and there were lots of problems with how I parked the stage up for this deduplication.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
So now we're at the stage where there's actually a lot of interest in the FST doing this.

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
I've heard from a lot of people that they would be interested in analyzing this data

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
and being able to explore this data.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
So what's next and what's already implemented?

10:57.000 --> 11:04.000
So there's the open contracting data standard, which is something that actually came after.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
TET was first published, so I told you already TET was first published in 2015.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
I think the OCDS started being developed around 2018, 2019, something like that.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
And if you now build any kind of public procurement platform, you use this data standard.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Because it's just a very nice way.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
People have put a lot of thought into how can we display this entire process of public procurement?

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
How can we put this neatly into a data structure?

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
And so now we're building TET with this data structure at its core.

11:39.000 --> 11:52.000
And the first task will be to parse this TET XNL jungle into this nicely specified OCDS.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
So I built a relational database that roughly captures OCDS.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
You see a lot of JCP because some things I didn't do for many to many or many to one,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
but JCP for now makes it much, much easier.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Otherwise this table would not have been presentable.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
And now, this is the graph system after all.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
The next question, because I think analyzing this data, analyzing public procurement data,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
analyzing these relationships between business and government,

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
is probably really lends itself to being encapsulated in the graph database.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
So this is really the core of OCDS that's interesting,

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
and that would be interesting to model in a graph database like Neo4j.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
You have this tender.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
A tender is basically a company says, like we thought,

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
like a public entity says we want to buy X or Y amount.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
And then an organization, another organization can apply for that.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
They're usually like something commercial.

13:03.000 --> 13:11.000
They say, look, we can furnish this tender, like we apply for this tender.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And that's interesting data, you know,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
so who applies for which tender and which regions and stuff like that.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
And then there's awards. That's basically who gets the contract after all.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
And so that would be a very simple place to start with the graph database,

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
to just have this, have all the test data going back from F15 Parcet into OCDS,

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
and then take this subset of what's really central and put it into the graph database

13:38.000 --> 13:46.000
and really start exploring this visually and that's what we want to do.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
And part of it is already done, so I'm currently working,

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
we are currently working on parsing this data, this XML.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
We use LXML library for that, which is really nice.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
And I've parsed this into a relational database,

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
and I specify the OCDS data schema with SQL model,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
which is really cool for the library.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
It basically gives you identity models and SQL Openly models in one entity.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
It's really cool. It's really nice to work with.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
And then I want to create like a CSV export to be then able to input that data in Neo4j,

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
put fast API, and scaffolding around that,

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
and then also build some UI, which we are currently researching, which framework to use,

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
and I'm also here to find out which one would be the coolest one, so I'll stay here,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
because I think there will be some problems in Neo4j's data.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Yeah, but there's also React Force Graph, and yeah, really like the nice UI

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
that's specifically geared towards that use case of analyzing public procurement data.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
And yet, I had that back and back by these two, like the relational database

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
and the Neo4j database that choose, depending on the query which data sources you

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
actually use.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
I'll go through the rest really quickly, but this is, if you want to get on-boarders,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
the documentation is still up around the edges.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
I'll do my best in the next days and weeks to really make the project approachable

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
to the developers.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
The plan is interesting.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
I want to work with you and the CSV on this.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
So, some key characteristics that we want to really kind of put a focus on with

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Detective is that it's, yeah, it must be free software.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It's reuse-compliant.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
It means that every file has the license header and the copyright header,

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
so that it can really be easily used.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
And we want to make it for the people, so like a lot of my work in the next weeks

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
will also include speaking to people who analyze programming data

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
and ask them what kind of queries they would, what kind of questions they would like to ask,

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
because that's really important for the design of the system that you use.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Ask people that are later going to use it, like, how could this be helpful?

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
We have done some of that, but we will do way more of that,

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
especially now because we start building the UI.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
And we want it to be interoperable, so everything that Detective uses,

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
every data that it uses will be also published under the CC5 4.0 license,

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
and there will be open API interface, so that will be completely available.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
Obviously, some limits gets too crazy, but we'll think about that when the problem arrives.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
And also, we fundamentally believe that link data is more interesting,

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
because once you have this data in the OCS format, you can start linking it

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
with other data sources, right, or if you haven't already graphed it,

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
you can start linking it with other data sources.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
Like, things that come to mind would be open corporate data,

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
where you can really enrich the data that you have in organizations

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
with data that's in this public database of corporate entities.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Open sanctions would then allow you to flag people or companies

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
that are on some sanction list, and stuff like the offshore leaks database

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
would allow you to highlight things to offshore companies and stuff like that.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
That's of interest for your analysis.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
So this would be a future possibility that I'm really excited about,

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
but the first step is obviously to get this into a nice format,

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
and then think about extending it.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
Some of the challenges is between this step data, because some of it's quite old,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
like if you look at data that was published in 2015,

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
and it's just, there's a lot of tables there,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
and there's these huge XML files that didn't currently do much validation

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
on the forums that were used to take input this data,

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
so it's in some places very messy.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
And also the S helps a lot actually with starting the session,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
because it's a very well-defined standard,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
and there's people like the mapping from S to S,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
and some people have published, so it's pretty cool.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
And then the next big problem that we would be helped with

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
is duplication of problem entities,

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
which are already kind of online-inning,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
and they are very cool.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
So we do have a good idea of that as they contribute,

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
because I think that's really central to taking it being helpful.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
So how can you get involved?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
All the code is on our get instance.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
At the moment, you can only really contribute PR issues

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
if you make an account, and I'll get this free.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
It's just a couple of weeks, but that's for now if we,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
if somebody manages that,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
then we'll think about mirroring GitHub,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
but let's try this first.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
Maybe there's a federation coming for the Git forges,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
not there yet, as I understand.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
There's also websites with the documentation,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and then you can also write an e-mail to,

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
this will reach always the maintainers.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Yeah, and I'm looking forward to your question.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Thank you very much.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Thank you.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
Regarding funding, did you try to contact the official European institutions

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
so that you can have funding for this slide,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
and so that it becomes like the default slide for that in Europe?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So I know that...

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Ah, yeah.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
So the question was whether we asked the Publications Office

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
for funding for this.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Not specifically yet.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I know that they are working themselves on a huge reform

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
of the entire ecosystem,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
so they do this, what they call e-forms now,

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
which is supposed to substitute what used to be TED,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
but e-forms still isn't most yet,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
there's discussions around that,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
but I don't fully understand all the time,

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
and they're also rebuilding the TED website.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
We should get the compact for them.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I have the compacts because we want this data fund,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
and we have the technical contact there,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
and we should make use of it,

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
but I was really that keen to code the past couple of weeks,

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
but this would certainly be very helpful to reach out to them.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Absolutely, and this will happen.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
And we already got some funding because we want this data fund.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
We'll use this.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
So the data that's currently produced for publishers

21:11.000 --> 21:18.000
is it still some TED or is it also called NOS-DS?

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
It will be all NOS-DS format.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
Honestly, I don't think anything else makes sense.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
So it's just a whole data that we will republish as NOS-DS.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
There's some place like OpenTenator.q,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
which was a component project,

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
which also does this republishing of the NOS-DS as NOS-DS,

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
but it's not consistent in how it's regularly

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
and how it updates its database.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
It doesn't seem very actively connected.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I got a question.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
When you look at these centers and companies involved,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
are you also able to extract what the ActionTender is about?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
So is there an underlying structure?

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
This is about, I don't know, classroom furniture,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
and this is about military equipment

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
so that you kind of can coordinate

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
both by item or by contract product?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yes.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
So shall I repeat the question?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yes.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
So the question was whether there's also data

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
on what has been procured and details about

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
what was being procured by a public institution.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
And the answer is yes.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
There's usually a title that's fairly descriptive.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
And a description.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
Sometimes an usage, sometimes another usage.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And then there's CPV codes,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
which is more like a common procurement vocabulary

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
that specifies what kind of category this procurement is in.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
But some stuff is excluded by this legislation.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
For example, like military equipment.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
It's not published in the state.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
It's not open.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
That's why we can't talk about open procurement

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
in good context yet, because there's still

23:02.000 --> 23:09.000
lots of sensitive data that's not being included in that.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Do you plan to host it publicly?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Yes.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
We plan to host it publicly.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Yes, absolutely.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
It's just at the moment that the API is down

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
because I've retracted so many things.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
But it will be off again.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Of course it will be publicly available,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
but if everything crashes,

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
because there's so much interest in it,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
then we'll think about limiting it somehow.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
But there's a sister from there.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Exactly, yes.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
So we'll see.

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
There's really that much interest in it.

23:45.000 --> 23:58.000
So what was the biggest challenge in cleaning the data?

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
So I would say one is just finding,

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
if there isn't English translation available,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
finding that for the specific,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
because we really lay out layout in this text well.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Whereas if a translation exists,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
where is it next in our time?

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
What does it apply to?

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
Another one was languages that I didn't know

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
the alphabet of for the hard to parse.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Yes, I just generalize company names

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
that they didn't have for a long time.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
I mean any validation on what you could put in there,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
which makes it really hard.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
And it would have been very easy to implement upstream,

24:47.000 --> 25:13.000
but now it's because of the sounds.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
Thank you.
