The talk introduces a new microkernel called Helios that uses the programming language Hair to achieve its goals of being small, capable of assisting programming, and capable of handling systems programming. Helios is a microkernel that utilizes capability-based security, has only 14 system calls, and emphasizes moving tasks that can be handled in user space out of the kernel. The talk describes some of Helios' features and capabilities, including synchronous and asynchronous inter-process communication, user space hardware IO support, and experimentation with Raspberry Pi. The talk closes with acknowledgments of the contributors to Helios and invitations to attend future talks about Hair and Helios.
