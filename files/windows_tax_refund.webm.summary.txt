Luca Bonasi's talk at the FOSDEM conference focused on the right to install any software on personal devices and the unlawful behavior of manufacturers to pre-install proprietary software, particularly Windows and Office. He discussed the difference between the hardware contract and software license agreement and argued that device neutrality is important for users to choose freely what software they want to install, ensuring the sovereignty of their devices. Luca shared his personal experience of requesting a refund for pre-installed software from various manufacturers, which he believes artificially increases the cost of the device. He also urged individuals who obtain a refund to donate to free software organizations.
