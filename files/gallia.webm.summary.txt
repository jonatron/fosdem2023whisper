In this talk at FOSDEM, Stefan discussed the GALIA framework, a free and open source software for automotive penetration tests. Built in Python, GALIA uses a modular plugin interface and is officially supported on the Apache 2 license. GALIA consists of multiple components, including a CLI tool, UDS protocol stack, virtual ECU module and scanner modules to discover, investigate and automate car ECUs. GALIA is an extendable and reproducible tool, offering both machine readable logs and configurable protocol stack.
