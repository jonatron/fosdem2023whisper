The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about Aura, a distributed systems runtime project written in Rust. The speaker discussed the motivation behind the project, which aimed to simplify and secure the node management at scale. Aura provides a central control for every runtime process on a node and runs as a minimal system, focusing on lightweight and remote API access. The speaker also highlighted the use of TypeScript and Rust in the project, as well as the benefits of Rust in terms of memory safety, maintainability, and the ability to use macros. The talk concluded with an invitation for audience participation and questions.
