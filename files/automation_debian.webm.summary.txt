The talk introduces a range of tools and initiatives aimed at automating changes to Debian packaging and reducing the workload for developers. The tools include Lintian Brush, which makes automated changes to the code, and Silver Platter, which automates the discovery of all Git repositories and runs Lintian Brush on them. There are some challenges to the system, including packages that are not hosted in Git, and systems that sit idle and do not provide notifications of changes. However, the system has been successful in processing most of the Debian archive and producing timely, accurate and high-quality changes across the archive.
