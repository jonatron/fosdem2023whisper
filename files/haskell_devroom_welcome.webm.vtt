00:00.000 --> 00:12.640
So, welcome to the first Haskell Dev Room at Fozdem and thank you for coming.

00:12.640 --> 00:19.040
We have a great lineup of speakers today on a diverse range of topics and a bunch of the

00:19.040 --> 00:25.600
topics are really aimed at newcomers to Haskell or people who haven't been programming Haskell

00:25.600 --> 00:32.960
for very long. So, please encourage people you know here at Fozdem to come along. I believe

00:32.960 --> 00:39.760
that there is a live stream, there is a matrix chat room where you can put questions or discuss

00:39.760 --> 00:50.720
the topics and we're going to have a raffle at the end of the Dev Room. We will hand out raffle

00:50.720 --> 00:56.960
tickets to people who are new to Haskell. So, the prizes, we have three copies of

00:57.680 --> 01:04.480
Graham Hutton's programming in Haskell, second edition and we have the booby prize,

01:04.480 --> 01:11.120
Jara Vegumite from my native country. We have stickers up the front here, come and grab some

01:11.120 --> 01:24.400
stickers to adorn your laptops or books or whatever you like. We have a lot, we have a lot of stickers

01:24.960 --> 01:33.360
so feel free to take a handful if you want. The first talk will be in just a few minutes

01:33.360 --> 01:42.640
so I will introduce the speaker in a couple of minutes. Thank you.
