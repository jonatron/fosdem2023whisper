The talk discusses the issue of slow Java startup times and how it can impact AWS Lambda. The presenter talks about the Piranha Cloud Framework, which is based on Jakarta EE, and how it can help solve the problem. Piranha Cloud has a new, flexible engine that allows for fast start times and is interoperable with existing code bases. The presenter demonstrates how the Piranha Cloud servlet can be used to create an AWS Lambda function with minimal start times even with cold starts. The talk also discussed some general Java options to reduce start times, such as increasing CPU and RAM, using a faster JVM like Java 17, and using class data sharing. Other options like Gravium or Crack can reduce start times almost to zero.
