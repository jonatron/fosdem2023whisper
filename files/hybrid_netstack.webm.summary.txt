The speaker introduces the concept of a hybrid networking stack, which allows applications to take advantage of XDP hook and AFXDP without re-implementing the full networking stack in user space. The talk includes a demonstration of a hybrid networking stack using the open source project Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) and discusses the challenges and opportunities for AF-XDP optimization. The talk concludes with a Q&A session.
