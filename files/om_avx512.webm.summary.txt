In this talk, the speaker discusses AVX-512 in FFmpeg, which is a single instruction multiple data instruction set for Intel CPUs. They explain that AVX-512 has been around since 2017, but it was not widely adopted due to performance throttling in earlier CPU generations. However, newer Intel CPUs, such as the 10th and 11th generation Ice Lake CPUs, do not have throttling, making AVX-512 more useful. The speaker describes the benefits and challenges of using AVX-512 in multimedia applications, and provides examples of AVX-512 instructions and their applications in FFmpeg. They also mention the availability of AVX-512 support in consumer equipment and cloud providers. Lastly, they discuss the collaboration between the multimedia community and compiler developers in optimizing code performance.
