The talk discusses the "stat storm" problem in package managers like SPAC, which refers to the slow startup times of applications due to the need for the dynamic loader to locate dependencies at runtime. The speaker explains that the current solution in SPAC is to replace shared object names with the path where the library is located, which improves performance by eliminating the need for the loader to search for libraries. They also discuss potential solutions such as patching ELF files and emulating a loader cache, and mention the trade-offs of static linking. The speaker concludes that while the "stat storm" problem in SPAC is mostly solved, further performance improvements could be made if they also controlled libc.
