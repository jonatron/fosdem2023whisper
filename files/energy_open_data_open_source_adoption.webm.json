{"text": " I'm David Fioriti from the University of Pisa and co-director of the Pipe Submits Earth Initiative. And today I will talk about open data and open source adoption in the NSG sector and in particular we will give the example of how we are doing the Pipe Submits Earth Initiative in which we develop energy modeling. So let's start from the business social model in energy planning. I really thank Robby for the fantastic introduction before and we can see that what the big players, most of the big players are doing except maybe few exceptions that also are presenting today is that a lot of entities which means governments or also TSOs and really big players are paying for having access to solvers, models and data to develop their own very specialized model to obtain some results that they are highly interested and they are willing to pay a lot for that activity. But this leads to problems of clearly transparency of results and replicability that we have been talking all about today. But to just draft a bit of what we mean is that and to clarify about the duplication that is occurring is that let's say that three entities are actually working on developing different activities very narrow focused. The entity A may have some features as likewise the entity B but different geographical scope let's say A is interested in Germany and the B is interested in Italy. On the other side the entity C that may develop something similar is interested into another feature to add for example stability features or so on but still working on Germany. This however leads to duplication of features because entity A and B needs to develop twice the same feature and entity C instead has to work twice to filter the data that are occurring and this is an issue and we are going to talk about this. In the open-air approach in energy planning is that the idea is to open up the different tasks and with open source tools that Robbie mentioned about and so this can be avoided because the parts that are needed the data handling and the efficient they can be simply taken up and appropriately used. In a short way let's not reinvent the wheel let's say and awareness of this is rising as we all know and especially the industry level it's interesting to see here that the organization of DSOs at the European level is pushing towards opening and using open source in practice however reality is a bit different. We have seen Alieander that is doing a great job here but at least an Italian level I tell you that this is taking a while and I'm sure that this is kind of commonplace. In fact the reality far from true complete here we can see data and the access to data is an issue that is needed to use successfully open and fully transparent activities and you can see here that in terms of public available data on final energy there is none. IEA is a lot of data and recently has pushed towards releasing openly the data but currently they are missing the funds to do so in fact they asked the national governments to come to feed the gap. So open tools are great but users may concern in using them because of quality and security issues that have been discussed and developers they have some concerns as well. However we can solve that and there is the need to improve on these together so to quickly and go beyond these barriers apparent barriers. On one side we need users to coordinate the developments so to not waste the scarce resources and answer the quality issues and long term sustainability that we are facing and on the other end developers with appropriate license that can be protected and can still thrive with no problems. So we talk about open data and what about the numbers. In 2019 in a recent review it has been they were reviewed about 30 energy models worldwide and thanks to open mode initiative we see that these numbers are growing and like last week the numbers was 73 and this is great but some concerns arise is there some failed cooperation in all of this. How much duplication is there in these numbers I'm not speaking about that I'm just posing the problem now and that's why I think that with initiative there is the need to provide guidance as they are actually doing and better coordination to work together rather than duplicate and activities and also to show the possible users that the actual model is already there. In particular I took the screenshot of the overview of the models and we can see that by columns it is possible to focus on some features that are interesting and I'd like to notice that I think it could be nice also to show some application based recommendations so let's say what if I want to develop an energy management system what are the options and so on. So now let's go at they use for energy planning. So these tools have been used for different scopes and they have different features and in particular in this case we have recently summarized some of the features that the different tools are providing and in particular we focus on energy planning used in Africa. Basically the state of the art of energy planning in Africa is done by the use of Plexus. Plexus is a commercial tool and that has a lot of features and it is actually very trusted by the industry and in fact very widely used but as we can see there are plenty of other open source alternatives that can be competing in terms of features with respect to what Plexus is offering and but why are not we using the open source that's a big question. So and that's why we need to build trust and to work together to thrive on this and the Peter said that I want to show here and also recall later when we go deeper into the pipes and its initiative is that we need to work together and then duplicate efforts and also share knowledge and data because by intertwining and sharing them we can only achieve this goal. So now let's go into deeper and how we do that at the our initiative in particular what is pipes and it's earth but it's earth is an open independent research initiative that aims at pushing at the global speed up the global energy transition by using open data in open source tools. In particular we have no barrier in terms of a peep of preconcepts we are welcoming anybody any of you of any friends that you may have to join and collaborate with us and if you ask okay but what are you working on so here you can see our main four pillars and I want none ever to strengthen enough the concept of community in fact this is the first one and we have the first concept and this is very important we have a discord channel and currently we are over 200 people in this discord channel well above and that's not like 201 it's like about 250 something like that number 300 already okay fantastic and they changed it pretty fast because I checked last week like fantastic and we push for open data because we believe and that open data is the only way and not only that we also push for open models and but that's not that's not a novelty but it's something that is also interesting to show is the concept of solver on the right because having open data and open models is not enough if you want to produce the results you need a solver that is open to possibly use in fact the initiative we have also showed that and improve the visibility of other tools from this point of view something that we know we is I think one of the novelties here is that when the project started and I have to be honest when the project started I was not there I joined as others as well is that we grew an existing user base so we didn't start from new modeling and with nothing else we started from the PIPSA user base that was already large and established with a lot of tools for different elements in particular you can see here PIPSA that is a framework we call it that that enables to draw to draw easily equations automatically so that the user does not need to do that if you want to add for example a storage in a in a bus it does it for you while instead we have also them there are the also the other models PIPSA Europe and PIPSA Europe sec that are the frameworks populated with data to represent the Europe system what we did is to leverage on this knowledge and this expertise and draw the earth modeling and that you can see here in particular we are working on several packages the earth model that aims at modeling the earth and other two models is linked for data creation that I will talk to you about later briefly and you may ask why PIPSA but the answer is here and it's quite popular and thanks to that our community is pretty large and I really like this image with a lot of faces and I think that we should update these numbers hopefully not adding all of them but the major ones so if I you if it to summarize our recipe in a single slide I'd like to show this here so first we start from growing an existing user base not creating a new one secondly by create by leveraging a user base there is an existing model and what we want to gather in our procedure is to cut all the possible contributions that other user may do because this can benefit each other in an interesting way in this matrix you can see that if a user other country then another user adding the feature a may benefit to of the existing feature so that they can use the feature a on the existing model plus the contribution of the country see and similarly lack likewise the feature be added by another person may may add on top of each other and this is what actually what we are working on we put to produce open data and open source tools that are then shared with the other communities as well in fact we add also other chats with other communities so to to possibly provide the data that we produce to feed other energy modeling tools for example written in Julia which is not our and then obviously clearly by doing this doing this activity we share knowledge so how to plan for a bright future we need policy tools and analysis and for these reasons we have provided pipes earth that is our measure tool for energy sector model for earth scope and we are working on distribution level approach that is called pipes of distribution but this is highly under development so for the one on the left the package is stable and what about the data so we have a lot there are a lot of open data but especially in some regions that are missing I like this slide in which you can see that on the left they are the open data and on the right you can see that there are a lot of missing ones in their actual data set and that's why there are we are there are some packages to tackle this issue particularly we are relying on we are developing the tech energy that aims to estimate the energy infrastructure that may be missing and on the other hand there is the demand creator that aims to estimate the demand and leverage on existing AI tools to perform this task so to give a very quick recap of three slides for what we mean with the energy modeling and pipes earth first of all what are the functionalities and we can see that to satisfy the need by the policy makers that are robust, reliable, low-cost, simple and planning tools we provide our solution that means to leverage validated models with the community support and those and the open community absolutely and really many thanks to the existing great work that the pipes of community has done and I cannot say it's not it's never enough so these to satisfy these requirements we perform a complete procedure that aims to start from the data analysis in which we open we use and rely open data sets such as open street map and so on and we filter out to produce high resolution data and without a solution we mean that if you want to model your municipality so that if you want the municipality resolution you if you have a computer big enough can be are able to do that for the region that you may be interested to tackle are you interested in Africa are you interested in Nigeria are you interested in Australia that's what you can do and how can you make it easy and the procedure is the following like the general procedure they follow is that we decompose the large problem into small pieces in which every contributor can add these its own few lines of code to actually obtain the result starting from the creation file down to results and how is it easy easy to run two lines when it works obviously first you choose your countries of interest secondly you run this and when it does not work like always you can add see the documentation and also access our discord channel that in which you can interact with us very easily and to summarize and show you some results these are some results that are being published in our preprint and in particular you can see net zero energy planning for Nigeria and Iran for for Africa Nigeria has been validated Africa we need to work a little bit more on the data and what's next earth is next currently I'm working on validating each single country worldwide I've started with Africa South America in Asia and currently we are a status about 60% of those working so I can show you an image also about the current status and to do so that we absolutely need to share knowledge work together and data so thank you very much for being here and I'm up question yeah please okay that's a good question so the question was okay when you run the just two lines what are the outputs actually so in particular I can show so first of all we have also a YouTube channel in which you there are videos in which we run the models with some of the community and you can see everything from start to the end in particular the outputs are a lot of files that are all the intermediate files that produce time series for demand time series for the renewable production as well as the structure that encapsulates the networks that we produce the in terms of software they are basically CSV file and C file so there are different data structures that are all documented and that can produce I can show you also an example of folder so I usually work on a remote computer so here maybe a little bit so I can show you exactly my current folder that I use for developments okay and I can show you also the status of the countries that are actually working and obviously it's improving so this is a folder connections I'm not sure if it's going sorry I was connected but I got this disconnected before and so okay in the meantime I do have a clone here locally maybe okay yes so this is a typical pipe folder you can see that there are different data structure and different folders I don't want to go into the details but because but there are videos that are actually tackling these problems and we are we have actually run the models together but if you go and into the results basically the results are a folder which contains a network that is that contains is a pipes a network and you can open it also with a notebook from Visual Studio code and you can reproduce and see the outputs if in the meantime the folder has loaded in the meantime that's loading maybe okay now it's loading yeah please so currently pipe cert is more at the question was if we can model at municipality scale so basically the a question about the resolution spatial resolution that we are actually addressing so currently pipes earth is working at transmission level also it because we all have data for transmission level because we also rely on open street map while at medium voltage and low voltage lines the data sets are quite poor if any or if I mean there are some few but really few which means that our model is more suited currently for larger areas in particular we work on with administrative zones JDM JDM data set and what we can do is you can choose the level you are interested into and you can run the model for that level of resolution this is possible obviously the data that are used are the data that are available of open street map but if you have high detail the data that it may be closed source you can fit them in without releasing and it is possible to use we are actually working on this and in the meantime it has loaded and we can see that I mean this is my current folder it's a bit there are a lot of stuff but this is because all these because I've actually run a lot of scenarios you can see the number of scenarios that have been run and each of them corresponds to a configuration file for the image that you have seen and the green the light green countries are those that are being successfully executed with the dark green we are almost there and also the others we are actually backfixing them and in the couple of few months we expect to have the entire picture green the white ones have been not executed yet sorry do you say that that would work in matches measure data or something no because the problems here are some are basically data management problems like in in china for example the the columns of the data set from open street map contained in Japan contained for example in frequency and in the tag frequency there was 50 comma 50 instead of 50 only so it was it's a really a data management problem that needed to be fixed and that's why now we improved the the representability of Japan and there are some other little bit backfixing that we are currently working okay so the the question more or less is what data we are using in the model so for the net depends on what is the type of information that we need we merge weather information coming for example for era 5 data we can we collect data from gdp and population data for the population data was over pop and so on there are different data if we look at the network data and open street map we as a mainstream data we consider the open street map data as a first producer but we are also working at a possibly streaming your own data because maybe there is another data set that is as better information or than open street map and you may be willing to use it instead of open street map for a single country and we are working on creating this interface to feed in more data it's it should be a few days of work if and also anyone is interested and I think time is up and but for anything you have my contacts and",
