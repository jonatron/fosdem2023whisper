In this talk, Haley Thompson discusses the development of a distributed music programming web app using Gleam, Beam, and the Web Audio API. She introduces herself as a front-end Elm developer and explains why she chose Gleam for this project, highlighting its compatibility across the entire stack and its simplicity. Haley gives an overview of the codebase, demonstrating how to create audio nodes with Gleam and how to render the app using the Luster framework. She then explains how to serve the app using the GLSEN and Mist packages and how to establish client-server communication using web sockets. Haley concludes with a demo of the web app and highlights that only 85 lines of JavaScript were needed in the entire codebase. During the Q&A, Haley answers questions about client synchronization, the need for JavaScript in the project, compatibility with other frameworks, and hardware device integration.
