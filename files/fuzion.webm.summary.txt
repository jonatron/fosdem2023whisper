The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about Fusion, a new language presented by Fridtjof that is built on the OpenJDK. Fusion aims to simplify Java's features by mapping them to Fusion features. The motivation for Fusion is to address the complexity of languages like Java and the increasing need for safety-critical systems. The talk also discussed the use of algebraic effects as a solution for managing side effects and improving security. Fusion is still in development and welcomes feedback from the community.
