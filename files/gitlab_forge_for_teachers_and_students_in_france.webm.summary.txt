Alexis Kaufman gave a presentation at FOSDEM about a free software forge project he helped implement in France. The forge provides a secure and sovereign online environment for French teachers and K-12 students to share instructional and pedagogical content in a mock-up language as opposed to code. He discussed how the project had been validated by the Ministry of Education and how it works to break down digital boundaries, increase collaboration and promote digital sobriété across the nation.
