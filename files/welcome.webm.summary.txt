 

This talk at FOSDEM 2023 focused on the Destination and Automation Dev Room and was delivered by the speaker asking for feedback from the attendees. The speaker suggested filling out an anonymous feedback poll at the entrance and on the desk. This feedback would be used to attempt to secure a bigger room with more people at a later date.
