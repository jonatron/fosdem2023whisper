This talk was given by Davide Beteo and focused on Running Airline and Elixir on microcontrollers with AtomVM. The talk discussed how the AtomVM software was created, how it is unmodified and runs on 80 kilobytes of RAM, and how it is currently compatible with OTP26, supports a lot of nymphs and biffs from Erlang, and has a simple list implementation for testing. Davide also mentioned that the AtomVM supports Linux, macOS, and ESP32 and that features like SMP support and debugging features have been added. Finally, Davide thanked the open source contributors who have been working on the project.
