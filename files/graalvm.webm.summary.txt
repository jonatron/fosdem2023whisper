 So we established the model correctness and consistency. And with some payload, the gain is even more obvious. So that's all about it. 

In this talk, Mito Chukko addressed two classical optimizations for a mature virtual machine, GrowLVM. He discussed how to implement a parallel garbage collector for it, how to use synchronization effectively, and using thin locks to improve the performance of streams. He also talked about the integration of GraalVM into OpenJDK.
