The talk is about getting the kernel on a mobile device, specifically the Fairphone 4, which uses the Snapdragon 750G SOC. The speaker mentions that some components like USB, internal storage, display, Wi-Fi, and others are already working, but others like the modem, microphones, and camera subsystem are not. He also explains the steps necessary to get a new SOC up and running, including figuring out how to make the bootloader boot what you want to boot, clocks, power domains, and other drivers. The speaker emphasizes the importance of committing progress and upstreaming patches early, and also highlights the challenges of managing panel drivers.
