In this talk, Mariam Tahan presented a concept of a hybrid networking stack which enables applications to take advantage of the XDP hook and AFXDP without having to reimplement the full networking stack in user space. She also introduced Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP) as an open source project to demonstrate the concept, providing libraries, a graph-based data plane, and Kubernetes components in order to provision and manage an AFXDP deployment. A live demo was then presented demonstrate how traffic could be filtered using XDP to be routed through the Linux networking stack or the CNET graph, depending on whether it was application-specific or not.
