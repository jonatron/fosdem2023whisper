The talk introduces QBOS, a container operating system built on OpenOiler, with the main design concept of using Kubernetes to manage the operating system directly. QBOS provides the ability to manage the OS through Kubernetes with API extension, custom resource, and CRD. Atomicity management of the OS ensures that QBOS upgrade is an atomic dual zone upgrade with less package manager usage. The file system in QBOS adopts a dual-area upgrade with classical dual image functionality. QBOS intends to improve its usability by displaying the upgrade and configuration process, and improving the image creation tool.
