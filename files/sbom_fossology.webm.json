{"text": " Yeah, hello everyone. My name is Shaheem and I am Gaurav with me. We both are working for a physiology community and we are from Siemens. So maybe let me start. So, Phosology is open source license compliance project. Initially, it was published by HP in 2008 and in 2015 it has become Linux foundation collaboration project and Phosology is a Linux application. It works on Linux distributions and different tasks done for OSS license compliance by Phosology are scanning for licenses, copyrights, author ships, emails and ECC statements. Apart from this, we have key words and IP address statements as well. And we also generate documentation like read me OSS text documentation and unified report as well. So and then we have export and import of SPDX files. So maybe we can discuss about SPDX files later in the slides. So Phosology is about finding the licenses as I said already. So we scan for the source code. So the source code might have the license text, reference to the license text or written text explaining some licensing and then we might also have the license relevant statements. So this all will be identified by Phosology. And later we have uploaded a component called thrift which is Apache source code. And Phosology have found Apache license. Apart from Apache license we have many more licenses. It is because it is very natural that OSS project reuses the available OSS from other projects. So for example, if you see Phosology have found 25 other licenses, relevant licenses in Apache, apart from Apache 2.0. So what is the uniqueness about Phosology is we have conclusions. So if you take licensing can be simple, but it might be challenging as well because you might see some unknown licenses, written statements about licenses, some licenses might be unclear and there might be some incomplete license statements as well. So actually to do this I think one required a good domain knowledge. So yeah, SBOM and Phosology. So we are producers of SBOM as well as the consumers. So Phosology produces SBOM in SPDX version 2.3 format which includes the file level information, license findings and its conclusions and copyrights as well as the custom license text. So as a consumer Phosology import all this information and add it to a component as well. So more information about the SBOM will be discussed later in the slides. So yeah, maybe Gaurav will take over and explain about the releases and more SBDX features of Phosology. Thank you. Thanks. So yeah, with Phosology we recently released few versions and in all of them we majorly try to sync our license set with the SBDX license set so we are up to date. And at the same time we are continuously working to improve our REST API so we can provide more automation flexibility to anyone who is interested to use it. And like recently we had some GDPR updates thanks to Orange like how the user data will be managed in the server and things like that we recently updated to Bootstrap UI. We are planning to move to React but yeah, it's in the works. With 4.1 we recently integrated scan code so you can upload your source code to Phosology itself and let Phosology scan using its own scanners or if you prefer you can also use scan code and import the license findings in Phosology itself. We also worked a little on our copyright false positive reduction using Spacey and with the latest release so we would like to say we are reused.software standard compliant in our source code and we also try to display the information like whatever reused linter provides. So you can check if any project supports reused standard they do it like that. So Phosology can, you can very easily know how much scan you have to do. So we are coming to the recent updates with SBDX within Phosology. So since it's a pretty old project and we had some difficulty to comply to the SBDX standards. So we decided to take on the challenge in two steps. So first step is done what we are presenting and the second is actually a work in progress. So what we initially started with the pain point was the license name which gets end up in the report. So Phosology initially use short names so which are supposed to be unique and they are actually used for identification with internally in Phosology. So here we added a new field called SBDX ID so where you can have different variants of the same license. So for example in a license there is a copyright by X but for a different one the same license with a copyright Y. So the license text changes but you can still use the same SBDX ID for both of them and that will be end up in the report whatever you generate. In case the SBDX ID is missing or is not in the SBDX license list so we also perform a check on that. So it will be converted as a license ref and we have introduced this license ref Phosology prefix for that. In the upcoming updates we will further enhance this and provide users way to write actual SBDX license expressions including the and or and with exceptions. So with the reports with various dog fest with SBDX we came to understand that many of our reports were flawed. So we try to fix them as well as at the same time update it to the latest spec 2.3. So what was wrong so the extracted licensing info was missing. So as I said you can have your own custom license text in Phosology so if any of the file has a finding of that license text or a conclusion on it. So the license text itself was missing from the report so we have fixed that and also the packet verification code used by SBDX. The algorithm internally was a little wrong so yeah minor fix and then at the same time we compared the spec and the fields which Phosology can store. So we figured out like we can have the version information as well in the report the release date along with external left to like PURLs, Maven, Nougat and such stuff. And at the same time Phosology also allows you to manage your acknowledgments and obligations. So we use the attribution text field for providing acknowledgments to specific files and the same attribution text field for the entire package if you have any obligation related to a license. And also the calculation of conjunctive licenses and disjunctive license was wrong. So yeah Phosology has a special license called dual license. So yeah we have fixed how we are going to calculate that now. So not every license in the report is now a disjunctive license set. And yeah also at the same time added the missing license name and text also for the listed licenses. So yeah with that I guess pretty much all our SBDX reports should now be valid. So yeah thank you and please consider starting us on GitHub if you do use them and if you have any questions. Yes please. Okay so the question is which format we use for SBDX. So Phosology currently supports the RDF and the tag value format. Okay so yeah the question is like with the SBDX ID if there is a custom license text how it ends up in the report. So yeah with SBDX IDF format so it's a self-contained report so it will contain your SBDX ID the license name as well as your custom license text along with all the other various formats which Phosology supports. Readme OSS your unified report they will work the same. It's just that instead of using the license name which was coming from the short name field we are going to use the SBDX ID field now. Yeah but how do you include the text of the license in the SBDX file? Okay. Because otherwise you get only. Yeah so if you see here SBDX has this field called license text. Okay. So you can include information like name of the license, license ID, its text if you have any external ref and such stuff. Okay. So it's there for IDF. For tag value I'm not very sure we need to check because for custom text they do support it for tag value format as well. But yeah for standard they do not. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Any more questions? Any support to the SBDX IDF? You are planning to do it. Yeah. Yeah yes you're planning. Okay. Any more colleagues? Yeah. Thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.64, "text": " Yeah, hello everyone. My name is Shaheem and I am Gaurav with me.
