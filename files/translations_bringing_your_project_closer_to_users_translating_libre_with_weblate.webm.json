{"text": " Hopefully, yeah, I will wait, I just want to test the sound that it works on the other side. One, two, three, weblight, weblight, weblight, pontoon, weblight, weblight, weblight, pontoon, weblight, weblight, weblight, weblight, weblight, weblight, weblight, weblight, weblight, yeah, it works like that. This is how you sell weblight. You just say it a lot of times and, yeah, yeah, great. So long two days, right, and a lot of to come. I just want to ask you if you can all do a frowny face, like you just ate something weird, yeah, test it, test it on yourself because you will need it throughout the talk. Because you are from different backgrounds, somebody is a developer, somebody is not a developer, somebody knows weblight very well and somebody came here to get to know weblight. Somebody was on my talk yesterday who was not, can watch probably tomorrow or the after, the recording, but I didn't get the link yet, so probably soon it will be. So the frowny face will be in use if you don't like something, if you feel like you are bored here. Just do your frowny face so I know that I should go a little bit quicker through what I am just talking about, yeah, okay. So I'm Benjamin, I'm from weblight, I do the talking and Michael there do the coding. So yeah, that's the weblight team and we also have a teammate named part and he does the coding part time. So what's weblight? And okay, weblight is a Libre localization platform, it's well-documented piece of software, I want to point it out because sometimes if you want to get to know to the software, you get to ask a lot of questions to other people. With weblight you don't have to, but yeah, you can still ask me if you don't find your answer in the documentation. It's a couple of the software, it's licensed under GPL3 and all the development is public on GitHub. We started as an open source project and it's not going to change because yeah, it's the best way to develop software. What weblight should do is to make the tough process of localization and coordination of a lot of people and having so many things at so many places just easy and it's for developers, it's for translators, it's for managers, it's for everyone that's involved in the project of localization and wow, it's a weird color, but next to a logo you will read it's a verb and yeah, some of our users started using two weblight which means I'm going to translate something on weblight, so we are a verb too. It works or is aimed that you will just set it once or tell it that it needs to be set in some way in the future and it will do itself, so you just set it and forget it and let it work for you because you don't want to do the work if it can be done by a great piece of software. It's supposed to be having all translations, so not just one platform, not just your website or your app, everything in one place, many, many stands of localization file formats are supported so you don't have to use weblight just for part of your workflow, put there everything and it will give you a free time. Once you have your translations there, you probably want to give it a context and communicate with other users, you can do that, if you find that search string weird, you can just add a comment, notify the maintainers and they will know it. Once you have it integrated, which means in the best way integrate it with your version control system because that's why Michal started weblight 11 years ago to have some kind of translation software tightly integrated to what you love to do, you will love to develop software not to send back and forth or use API calls or write scripts, you just want to develop your software and let some other software do the parts you don't fancy that much. Once you have your translations there, then you go to the editor if you are a translator, which is a lovely part of weblight where you can see all the context, all the screenshots, all the communication with other translators and where you can localize the string to your desired language out of the searched language or multiple languages. Once that's done, weblight does the magic as Jean Baptiste from Fedora said because there are all the checks and fix ups so you don't have to control the quality of your, I shouldn't be in front of that so, right. You have the quality you want to, not some messy translations that can be understood differently in the app in the end. Once this is done or while this has been happening, you have it in a database, we prefer the elephant but you can also use MariaDB but elephant has more power, more strength for the best performance and once you finish there, weblight stores it in the underlying Git repository and that's part of the magic because that's a tool you already know how to work with so if you are a little bit lost about, let's say you got a merge conflict because you added the same thing in weblight and in your repository because yeah, you don't want to wait, you want to have everything continuous, you just solve a merge conflict and if you don't know how to, it's described in the documentation of weblight so that's the easy part, that's the way how to make it continuous with as less false as possible and basically you need to get your translations in then do as less work with help of machine translation and stuff and then get it out and in and out is very easy because it's just thinking one Git repository with the other or if you prefer work with the API, weblight has it so you can do that or if you like to translate in some offline tool, in desktop application you just download the file for localization files in the file format you like because weblight can converse this for you and then you can upload it back without being afraid of making the file invalid and once you have that everything set up you can reuse your translations because there is a translation memory which you improved by your manual translations and with machine translation so if you are let's say translating the same project over and over again for new versions like LibreOffice you can build your translation memory with help of machine translation with help of your community and in the end you don't need that much of manual work, you don't need that much questions to the machine translation engine because you already have your core, your basis in the translation memory which you can use as a source for the machine translation so that's the reuse and as a result what you want to get out of weblight is your software in your language because yeah then you truly own it, you truly own it, you want to reduce as much work as possible because everybody wants to work on what they desire to do not the manual work that's again and again the same so let translators do their work, let developers do their work and happily be codependent you want high quality translators, translations and you want the engagement from the community because if they have the easy way if they figure out in their UI they are just watching there is a mistake and then they probably know the best how to correct that mistake but if they won't find the way how to correct it where they won't send you an email if they have the tool it's their software they can make it better very easy way make it themselves it's their software so they can work for the whole community and attract more translators more users because that's how you do it you of course want to free the time of developers yeah I think I already said much about it and you want to be prepared for the future versions and for the future project because usually you use the same translation so you can be very well prepared for that too Weblight as a project started 11 years ago as a part time project but now I will probably talk more about it if we have time in the app but now it's sustainable on itself without any venture funding or something like that we how we get the funding these are the four ways we offer the hosting services to commercial customers or to lovely projects like Fedora or some other projects like some other projects like OpenSUSE because Mikhail started it while working in OpenSUSE are using Weblight for long years but they hosted themselves and just pay for the support because sometimes they need a little bit of help with something we also offer custom development because as we are a small team we are very flexible in delivering new features and as we have the same code base for everyone no matter if you are a commercial customer of Weblight services or if you are small or large Libre project you have the same features there so if very big corporate like some Siemens company will pay for a nice feature you as Android developer of a small podcast app can use it too and that's great or you can contribute to the code and they will get it too because you want to support big companies too give them something back maybe and of course as every Libre project we also accept donations then you came here probably if you know Weblight to listen about the plans what we planned for this year and this is it we want to become more enterprise ready the current state because some of you we met at GNU HealthCon the good thing is that more of a large part of the work at the backend is done what means enterprise ready at this moment Weblight as it started as a small project and not aimed to be something that influential and that important to large groups of people to large projects there is currently just a project and a component and that's it but you will be able to create multiple levels of grouping let's say for different versions yay Fedora is happy and we are happy too but give us time give us time a little bit and of course when you have the large group large community you need to manage them you need to give them access and at this moment it's possible in Weblight you can connect your single sign on method like SAML or GitHub or GitLab and manage them there or you can do it in Django admin some strange thing but this is a history now now you can manage it fully inside Weblight and there will be even more so you can use Weblight similarly like you are used to with GitLab GitHub and other tools where you can create the teams organizations and let them do their work without you having to pay attention to that all good yeah okay then as Weblight again most of the things are something we didn't plan in the original way so now Weblight is a little bit rusty to play the big part for large projects or and some of those is also universal search hints because at this moment search is some on some levels or on the whole level but can't it's not that convenient and it would search from one place everything in between so you need to click through and then search for something this will be changed also to make it easier to navigate because from our operating system from our cooperative tools we got used to to a nice universal search in on every platform so you will find that in Weblight too and yeah that's it of course UX can be better every time we really want to grow the team so yeah if you know a developer tell them it's a great project they can contribute and they can get paid for it which is really nice in open source world and yeah we want to continue organic growth and after yesterday talk we got to some talking maybe we will do something with pontoon maybe not because there won't be time maybe it will make sense maybe it would not but we would like to be to investigate that way too and yeah as we still have some time maybe we can talk about how Weblight began this is where Weblight began this is Michael's office who was on yesterday's talk lightning talk okay good so this is small room on top of the large concrete building we built in the Czech Republic and it's like three to four meters something like that and there used to be all the machinery for the elevators so it's not a garage project it's basically the elevator project and it's weird because it was like on top of the elevator there was no elevator at the time when Michael was coding there so yeah we need like higher elevator or just use the steps and build them before so yeah it takes time and yeah this is website of Weblight where you can see all the translations that are happening on Hosted Weblight these are some of our lovely users from the open source community what pushed us into big feeling of responsibility was when a few years ago Fedora approached us and realized that they want to use Weblight because it makes sense and it doesn't make sense to if they want to create a great Linux distributions and they have a lot of other work they don't want to maintain Zenata because they don't have time that's not their main business so they switched to Weblight they did it really really well in the migration process of course they found a lot of bugs we were able to fix them thanks to them because yeah once a developer finds your bug they are usually or technically skilled people great to describe what's the problem and then it's very easy to fix it and yeah that's what got us to the current state and if you want to hear more about this thing why we feel that there should be something to connect Weblight with other tools and make it easier for all the communities you can listen to the yesterday's talk why the recording will be available we will definitely let you know on our website we will definitely let you know about everything on our Mastodon account and I think we don't need to take the time about my story just a funny part my story with Weblight became we first met with Michal at Fosdam in 2017 and I was here with a different project and another Michal yeah popular name in the Czech Republic introduced me to this Michal that was my colleague that time and that project that was tourists open source router and then we didn't see with Michal for two more years and then in 2019 I came here looking for a job in 2018 I came here with a different project and 2019 I just wanted to return to Fosdam and be in the atmosphere and that time I was living in Prague Michal was living in Prague we knew each other yeah but we met here again and we started working together so yeah tell that to people just come to Fosdam but yeah you already tell them so yeah I think we have like 12 minutes now for questions so yeah let's talk and you probably you are all smiling there was no frowny faces okay who has the question hello Jean Baptiste but we have some kind of a plan so that in the future we can search for translation coming from whatever data suits because we have Weblight hosted for the federal project we have the Weblight for Libreface the one that you are hosting and there are many other places where you can find use for translation but as a translator I would like to search for every existing translation of some terms and I want to see okay what is oh consistent is my translation at the moment and should I align on the current way it is translated or maybe it's wrongly translated in most places and I should go fix the translation okay I would love to see something that helps us to at least iterate the knowledge not having some kind of magic tool that we are also looking for as raising the world's translation but just to know what is the true state of translation and I think the Mozilla people have some tool that allows them to search for existing translation I would love to see some kind of tool that allows me to search for a string across all the translation coming from the weblet's instance or even from other okay I will try to sum up the question now we will see if I was paying attention so the question was if we plan to introduce some place it's slightly related yesterday when I had my lighting talk about possible translation MD something like that I meant to show people show translators one place where they can find the project they want to translate and Jean Baptiste would like to take to elevate it to weigh another level to have some kind of shared translation memory or shared glossary where translation translators can go to and check how to translate the best the best the thing they are currently working on yesterday on my talk I was trying to be not very imaginative because I usually am very excited about everything and then there is no time to do that I can imagine something like you just proposed but I can't imagine anybody doing it because that would just mean a lot of a lot of people working on it and then we would need to help with some licensing and stuff so yeah it would be nice I'm not opposed but I can't imagine at the moment I would start with what I was talking yesterday and then maybe on top of that might be something to build on currently you can search on hosted Weblight which is pretty large base of open source project you can search through their translations because they are open and yeah you can search on discover Weblight for the project so you can realize through their oh I want to see how Susie or Fedora is translating that or Susie or Fedora is translating that and yeah you can go from there but you all every time you have to go to that particular space and search it there so yeah maybe we will just once we have the translation MD we think about for two years and not doing anything on it and also universe of search then we will just maybe throw it to some clever people with AI but I'm scared of what would happen from there so yeah there is another question so some kind of a okay the question was if there would if there is any plan to provide if there is any plan to provide some kind of live preview of the strings that are translated another thing we were the answer is another thing we were talking about through recent years and that's quite large to develop so again we would like to do that and you can support this effort if you find help to find us front and developers so it's kind of you can do it but it's not and this was not the intention of the teacher okay I will play a little bit like a sports commentator on the right we have what's your name twice and on the left we have Michael from web late and twice is having an Android app and needs to wants to see it before he commits to the version and Michael is saying it's partially possible and you can talk after the talk into the deep of this topic and we still have more time I will stop you here stop you here it's not a problem it's not a problem it can't it's it's a thing that can be solved very easily we will just tell you go here follow there that's not a problem you can actually you can actually do this you can actually do this web late uses translation memory once you have it you can export it import it in tbx which is a standard format and you can also use web late translation memory as a source for I will repeat the questions at the end sorry you can use also web late as a source for your machine translation so it's just clicking in the UI and it should serve your needs the question was if it's possible to use web late as a source for machine translation can I yeah okay we still have time is there any other question okay oh yeah translate is supported as a machine translation source in web late so you can use that but we are not yet connected with the community and we will be happy to connect with them and maybe figure out some deeper integration and more promotion in the community and yeah I will get back to you after the talk and there was one more question I'm sorry I have to stop you I will go closer to you yeah or if you yeah yes it's in a context in the editor of web late they're under the source and the field for the translation there are a few tabs like comments like other translations in neighboring projects and also or new projects and components and also if you set up your machine translation engines they will see it there so they don't have to look for it they will your translators will see there and they will just click to copy it into the translation and like without without offering translators to to copy it just translate everything to machine translation you can yes yes there is there is an add-on called automatic translation and you just in install this add-on and instruct it to use particular or or trans machine translation engines you set up at your web late instance or for your project to insert translations or suggestions for untranslated for or for all strings so it is possible the add-on is called automatic translations and you will find more info in the web late documentation okay we will get there after the talk thank you very much for being here thank you for your time and enjoy rest of your FOSDEM experience and see you next year okay okay okay I can do that it's not all it's just some and there is the next speaker is not here yet so here we go you can do it you can do it he will just take a picture and we are sad enough I have no problem I don't care he's the one in charge okay", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 9.52, "text": " Hopefully, yeah, I will wait, I just
