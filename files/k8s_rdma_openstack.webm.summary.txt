In this talk, John Garbert from StackHPC discusses the integration of OpenStack, RDMA, and Kubernetes. He explains the benefits of using these technologies together and how they can help optimize infrastructure investments while reducing carbon costs. He also introduces the Azimuth project, which aims to make it easier for platform creators to package and deploy reusable solutions on top of OpenStack. John then dives into the technical details of using RDMA in OpenStack servers, creating Kubernetes clusters with Cluster API, and enabling RDMA in Kubernetes pods. The talk highlights the importance of network configuration and the use of tools like Maltis and MAC VLAN CNI. John also mentions the integration of Slurm clusters with Kubernetes and the potential for future enhancements in network topology and placement.
