The talk introduces Elixir, a language built on top of the Beam virtual machine, also known as the Erlang VM. The language inherits the properties of the runtime which was originally created for telecom systems, meaning it is 24/7 and needs to be full-tolerant, concurrent, and distributed. The creator of Elixir, Jose, wanted to make it easier for newcomers to learn the syntax by introducing more extensibility to the language, build tools, and documentation features. The talk concludes that Elixir adds something new to the Erlang foundation, with examples such as machine learning extension NX numerical Elixir, web framework Phoenix, and smaller device-compatible project Nerves.
