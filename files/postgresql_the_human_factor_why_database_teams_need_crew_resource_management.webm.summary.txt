In this talk, Chris Trevers discusses the importance of human factor training for database teams. He emphasizes the need to understand human error and the biases that can lead to mistakes. He draws examples from the aviation industry, which has made significant improvements in safety through a better understanding of human error. Trevers also emphasizes that automation is not the sole solution to human error and that humans need to be in control of decision making. He recommends further reading on human factors and aircraft accidents and suggests conducting drills and simulations to test and improve incident response. Finally, he acknowledges the challenge of justifying the time and money spent on human factor training, but suggests that incidents and problems can provide evidence of its value.
