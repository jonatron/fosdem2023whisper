{"text": " Yeah sure check check check all right all right all right hello everyone first time actually I'm talking about this project on the conference so far as them here's at first the images that are generated with mid-journey so I'm going to talk about this self-hosting for non-coders somewhat of a click-by-title but we'll get there I have a question for you all did anyone try raise your hand if you tried hosting mastodon on your own a mastodon server all right all right we have a couple hands now keep your hand up only lower your hand if you think the process was easy or simple or enjoyable okay all right so this is the mastodon docs on how to host it this is just one page this is actually not even the hosting part this is just preparing the machine so out of this room here I guess three or four people tried that and I can understand them it's not easy and this doesn't this doesn't just apply to mastodon it applies to many apps actually that you would want to self-host many open source apps because apps are getting complex does this not work oh really should that right will there be does this work better okay all right so yeah so you saw the huge instruction you know what we want is everyone to be able to host mastodon because that's kind of the point of mastodon right it's decentralized there's Docker out there that many many projects use to simplify this process of hosting something maybe maybe we could host mastodon with Docker so this would be the Docker setup I guess doesn't look that much easier and I mean imagine I'm I assume that most of us here are technical people but imagine if you don't know how to use a command line that'll just be impossible you can forget about it you would use someone else's mastodon server so what if I tell you there is a way actually for people who don't even know how to use a command line to spin up a mastodon instance and this is how it would look like this gif is a bit sped up but it actually is close to the normal speed what's happening here is I'm entering a couple config values the mastodon is deployed on my machine anywhere I want where I have this gardens have mastodon is deployed streaming services deployed configured sidekick services deployed configured post grass databases deployed configured ready services deployed configured as you see master has a lot of services and we're done we have a mastodon instance now this would be the it's actually open on the internet I host a couple of those myself with this method and this would be the URL that I end up having and of course you can have it on your own domain if you own a domain you would have the mastodon let's say on your domain so the process without regard to speed me speeding up the gif took one minute forty four seconds I counted and you can do this locally on your own machine if you want you can do this in a cloud if you do this in a cloud that would be even a bit easier but we'll talk about it so this is called gardens it's an app it's a platform that I'm making it's open source under a gpl point three and it's not the only one not the only self hosting platform out there that really simplifies deployments actually this project is based on another one called cap rower I don't know if anyone in the room knows it okay it has a hundred million plus docker pools so a very established project it's out there for many years already it was called captain dug dug previously but cap rower was meant for hobbyists and kind of for testing our aim with gardens is to bring it more to the organizations so get it to a level where it's actually the stuff that you deploy like mastodon or anything is you can use it instead of a SAS service for example in an organizational setting so the technical part of this is roughly this it's a web app the web app actually you deploy on your own server so even the web app is on your own server we have a website for non technical people where they can connect their cloud account to deploy to their server but after they do that everything else happens on their machine this web app talks to docker API it uses docker compose which actually you cannot use the API so there is some processing there to deploy containers for these apps so for example like I was showing this various services that mastodon spins up they're all in separate containers and of course you can not just have mastodon deployed like this you can deploy jitsimid you can deploy wordpress I'm going to show a couple more examples and then we use nginx to show these apps on the web and allow the actual end user to interact with them now what I mentioned for non technical users right now we support digital ocean if let's say you don't know how to use a command line but you want to have gardens on your let's say VPS or your machine you just there's not all the flow you connect to digital ocean and then there's a no code process where you spin up gardens and then from gardens you can use it but there's also a local process where you just run one line in the CLI you pull basically the gardens container and then gardens does everything from there doesn't actually I mean it talks back to us to get the list of apps available but our end goal is for it not even to talk back to kind of really be isolated in your environment so these are just some examples of the apps we have in gardens there's really a lot of good open source products that are coming out recently of course there are established players like wordpress there is stuff to replace social media like peer to you here are just some examples of what those replace so of course with mastodon you can replace something like Twitter pen pot here at the bottom left you can replace figma they actually had the talk previously at the conference basero or no code B can replace air table juicy meat can replace zoom outlining an improved confidence and there's actually other alternatives there so you're you can choose whatever open source product you want to host we have about 130 apps a bit more available right now that you can sell host with one click but there is also an option to deploy your own apps or even connect to git lab let's say have a bit of CI CD going if you're more technical as I mentioned the process of spinning up those apps is based on docker compose mostly there are option to even spin up from tar archive and so on but this is like the main method yeah we do some processing of docker compose files that are taken from official repositories of these app developers and then we just spin this up for you so gardens is just one example it's I'm talking about it because I'm making it cap rower is what we forked because it's very reliable very nice service cool if I is a newer service similar to that the main difference I'd say is for the proxy we use engine x they use traffic and you know host is a bit different but it covers the same use case to self host stuff it's a bit different because it's a debut and distribution so you have that on kind of replace your operating system whereas gardens cap rower and qualified they are all apps that you can put right now on Ubuntu debut and I think on CentOS as well I actually got it working on macOS but that's more experimental so why do we even want to self host let's go back to that I'd say actually if we want software freedom which is I guess the point of open source in a lot of ways you have to be able to self host but as we can see from here you know just several people hosted mastodon let's say I imagine many more here use mastodon it's kind of like if you're not using this freedom or if you're not able to because you can't handle the technical side because it's too difficult that kind of defeats the purpose right so if you cannot host you don't really have freedom if you have it technically or formally let's say so I'd argue that this not having freedom is bad but also bad not just in a kind of ideological way but also in a competitive way if open source wants to be able to compete with all these SaaS apps out there because this is like something that open source has that proprietary apps just don't have and it's an unfair advantage I think I believe that right now organizations how they use it is they use proprietary SaaS by default they self host when they are really worried about privacy or there's some kind of sovereignty concerns or something they don't care about open source and how it should be is you self host instead of SaaS by default but then you choose a SaaS where it's too complex or you want the scale or there's some specific requirements or if you want to support developers because that's a one way they earn and they can financially support the development so to bring some numbers in there I've been hanging out on Reddit self-hosted subreddit and I found the statistics so for the past like seven years the number of people there skyrocketed to more than 200,000 people on the subreddit so it looks like people are interested actually in hosting their stuff but I also run a poll with 1,250 participants about that number where I found out that people on that subreddit they don't really self host anything business critical so to say or anything for their organization anything for productive use or at least not a lot of them so about only a hundred people self host let's say next cloud or something but most of them self host for media so let's say for movies or something or for personal use so maybe something for their smart home so that I think is a pity but I can understand that why people are not self hosting because it's complex like we discussed for organizations I mean because it's complex but also because of these issues you don't just want to spin up an app there's also a part that comes after you deploy which is about maintenance which is about making sure that your instance is secure and if you get a lot of users you also want to scale you want to have an option to scale so how we deal with that is for maintenance for each app for each service that I was showing you let's say for Macedon you can view logs in the graphical interface so you don't have to as attached to your instance to view logs we keep a version history we track analytics for your instance with net data so you can see let's say how much CPU is utilized how much RAM is utilized so you can kind of check the health and native that actually provides nice notifications so you can even get notifications where you want or have a web hook to get updated one let's say you're running out of CPU RAM for security we covered that with automatic SSL for all apps you can force it you can force HTTPS we have basic auth so that we do with let's encrypt for scalability actually that's the part I love the most if you have a lot of users you can scale either by adding more instances of the same app on the same machine and gardens will redistribute automatically the load or you can scale by adding more machines into a Docker swarm so we support Docker swarm this is the same for capro or so I'd say people want a self host but it's hard and we need to help them so otherwise they just use SAS like currently and this is one way to do it you can help this effort by if you're a developer maintaining Docker compose files or documentation just a way to self host for your application if you're a sysadmin or DevOps you can think about providing a platform like this to your organization so that people in your organization can spend something up without having to bother you and you can everyone here of course should use open source instead of SAS and you should try self hosting if it's if you find self hosting hard you can check out some of those self hosting platforms and of course host not on AWS or something but you can use some of those posters cloud 68 been giving a talk here a bit earlier chat on says a French network of good hosters liberal host is another one so look at other hosting solutions thank you and yeah have a good rest of the conference.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 22.0, "text": " Yeah sure check check
