Jaco, a firmware engineer at Sartura, gave a lightning talk at FOSDEM about their work in open-source switching and their involvement with the DENT project, which aims to create an open-source enterprise-grade network switch. Jaco discussed the limited number of platform supported in the mainline kernel and the challenges they face in achieving a fully open-source switching platform, including the lack of a standardized power over Ethernet management interface in the Linux kernel. They also mentioned their work on projects such as the Linux ONI NVMM project, replica 1 build system project, DHCPv4 static leases and 802.1x support in the host APD project.
