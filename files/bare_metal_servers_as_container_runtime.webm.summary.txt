The speaker, Florian from Scaleway, discussed how they use servers to handle their production workload just like if there were containers. Scaleway is a European cloud provider with around a thousand servers in production and more than a hundred bitabytes of storage. They use pixie live booting for easy deployment and maintenance, and they use Ansible for automation. The speaker also discussed the creation of pixie images, which are squash of s that you download over the internet. They have been using this system for five years and it has proven successful in providing the convenience of containers while using bare metal servers without any issues. They also take client data and store it in memory, with every other server inside their infrastructure being diskless for the OS parts.
