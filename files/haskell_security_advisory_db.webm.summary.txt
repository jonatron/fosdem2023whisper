The talk is about the creation of a Haskell Security Advisory Database, which is used to report security vulnerabilities and disseminate information to commercial and non-commercial users of the language. The proposal for the creation of the database was accepted in August 2022, and the database repository was created in November 2022. The next step is to assemble a security response team who will manage the database and respond to incoming security reports. The team's responsibilities include updating and maintaining the database and liaising with the developers of downstream security tools. The talk calls for volunteers with experience in security-related topics to nominate themselves for the security response team, and the initial team will be announced around the end of February.
