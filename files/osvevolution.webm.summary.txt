The talk is about OSV, a unique kernel designed to run single and modified Linux applications on top of a hypervisor. The speaker discusses the enhancements introduced in the latest release of OSV 057, focusing on greater modularity and composability. They discuss new experimental modes to hide non-Glasses and standard C++ library symbols, the extraction of the ZFS code into a dynamically linked library, improvements to the ARM port, and an interesting use case of OSV, the use of seaweed FS running on OSV as a distributed file system. They also mention the small size of the OSV community and invite more people to join. Finally, they mention future plans to support statically linked executables, improve spin locks, and add support for ASLR.
