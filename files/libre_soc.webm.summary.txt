The LibreSock project is creating a free and open-source ship design for a family of systems on ship products for powering routers, cell phones, laptops, and more. The design aims to avoid proprietary binary blobs and drivers by utilizing grants, donations, and a pool of community experts. The architecture is based on the open power foundation's power instruction set specification and uses Python for auto-generating decoders from specifications. The design has gone through various stages, including a simple core, vectorization, and parallelization, and has been tested through simulation, FPGA, and ASIC. The project is partnered with Red Semiconductor to produce thousands of chips for the market.
