{"text": " Hello everyone, my name is Ann and I'll be talking to you about changing culture, research culture through open collaboration. There was a little bit of a last minute tweak to this talk and I think you'll find out why in a second. I am the community manager of the project but I do want to flag here that I'm a member of a core team of 28 people who represent, who talk about the Turing Way in different contexts in their own spaces. Also really excited to see a lot of frictionless data plugging over the course of all of the talks today because as an ex-fellow I'm happy to see representation of the project. So first and the most obvious question is what is the Turing Way? We are an open source guide on data science and open research. We are documentation first project in a community which means that we involve, we support a diverse group of folks in order to make data science reproducible, ethical, collaborative, inclusive for everyone. So while you may have seen the book around, you may have seen it cited in different spaces. We're very much a global community of folks. We draw upon a lot of open source tools in order to make our guides in order to talk about them, to write about them, to bring them to different spaces and we're also very much a culture of collaboration and I will try and keep my volume up. We are hosted at the Alan Turing Institute which is the UK's National Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence but I do want to flag here that while we're hosted there, many of the folks who maintain the project, who have written chapters, who have been a part of the project have very much come from all around the world and have led to many different and challenging questions about the state of the discipline itself. We've grown a lot over the course of the past four years, over 250 pages and I updated these stats just late last night over 1.5 K people who have started on GitHub and if there's anything that I want you to get out of this talk, it's that all of the illustrations that you'll see throughout are things that you can download, that you can use for your own work and as of last night we have had over 19,000 people use those illustrations and over 16,000 people that have downloaded them so please, please feel free to use them for your own work. They illustrate many different aspects of the research project, research process about working with data, about working with each other. Just a couple of small things about its impact beyond the data science world is that our aim is to affect folks in policy, folks in other kind of public facing spaces including in education and we've seen the citation of the Turnway project really grow over the course of particularly the past couple of years. But to kind of take us back to the beginning and more about the foundations of the Turnway itself, we really started as a project in response to the crisis of reproducibility in science as you all are well aware of by Dr. Kirstie Whitaker in 2018. As you know, many scientific studies are difficult and impossible to reproduce. She as a neuroscientist was especially aware of this and from this notion was really asking is there a place where best practices or ways of working could be gathered together and collectively made again, drawn upon open source methods. And again, reproducibility being when you use the same tools and the same data, can you create the same result as different or separate from the notion of replicability, generalizability or robustness more broadly. So from there, the guide for reproducible research began in 2018, 2019 and has many different resources related to version control, licensing, different tools that you can use. We encourage you to check it out and use it for your own work, but we also are saying that you should not read it from back to front or from front to back because it is over 250 chapters long. So really, it's very much meant to be a kind of buffet where you're able to take different parts of different things that might be useful for your work and for your research. But we soon realized and many people within the community soon realized that in order to talk about reproducibility in science, you have to talk about the scientific process itself. You have to talk about the design of your project, about how you communicate your work, about the collaborative process, about embedding ethics throughout every stage. And so from that one guide grew into five different guides related to kind of all different parts of scientific research, in particular with the addition of Dr. Malvika Sheran to the project in 2019. And we also document a lot of our practices as a community and what we call the community handbook so that other open source groups can use those practices as well. So it's very much meant to be open all the way down and in many different contexts. So again, you see this trend of transformation from reproducibility and best practices for reproducibility and the best practices for open research more broadly. But going even further than that, and as I entered the project as a community manager of the course of the past year, we've really seen a development in these conversations shift. Very much we've seen conversations around maintenance and community care become and grow to the forefront of folks within the Turingway community within, you know, in many ways the community of open scientists more broadly. We also have folks who within the project started on their own the process of translation and localization of not only the Turingway but open science principles more broadly. That means in many cases, in the case of, for example, Arabic, one of the ongoing translations of the project that's happening right now, you are actually inventing a language for open science that doesn't necessarily exist currently. And we have ongoing translations at the moment happening in, I believe, Arabic, French, Spanish, Turkish, Japanese, and I might be missing a couple, but again it speaks to what happens when you adopt open source methods, practices, ways of working and all people to make and adopt this resource in context that makes sense for them. Of course, very much the core of all of this is supporting open infrastructure and governance as well. The entire book is hosted on Jupyterbook and again, hosted openly on Github as well, which includes a lot of our project management work as well. So we again try to be as open as possible. Part of this, of course, is mentoring researchers at every stage, incentivizing PIs as well as early career researchers to adopt open practices and really set the tone and the culture within their labs as well as increasingly talking about accessibility in different contexts. And within the community, we've seen accessibility take on the notion of not only how can we make the term way accessible in a web kind of way, but also how can we make data science more accessible for the public? How can we make cross-disciplinary conversations more possible? How can we be as accessible for the most number of people as possible? And that includes bridging any tech barriers that may come from working especially with non-computational researchers. And finally, all of this is very much under the umbrella of advocating for a change in research culture as we know it. So all of this said, a big part of that is how we go about the process of acknowledgment. We have this really funky bot called All Contributors Bot that we have installed within our repository, which is all about trying to acknowledge all the different types of work that happen within not only an open source project, but within a community. So we try to add a lot of those citations there and again to recognize that it's not just the researcher, oftentimes it's the entire infrastructure, both human, social, technical, that surround a project, that surround research, that really is important to recognize and acknowledge all of the time. And again, we also host lots of fun events, both online and in person throughout the year. Collaboration cafes, what are called book dashes, kind of like but not really like a week long hackathon. So we host to end with little obligatory pitches, connect with us online, read the book, but also join us in any of these different spaces. Really trying to pitch you all on the turning way, of course. Join us at any one of these events if you'd like and I think just want to end here on the note that in spaces like Fosdom, but in any environment in which we find ourselves as a community, it's really about meeting people where they are and we've had conversation with folks that can reign from extremely technical, you know, open infrastructure conversations and the difficulty of implementing that, but also the, I don't have any computational resources in my lab and I want to learn these skills to work with data, how can we have those two people in the same room and have a resource that is useful for all of them. So again, me just representing a bunch of other folks who have made the turning way what is, really thanking them for all the work that they do. And I think that's all. Thanks everyone. Yeah, of course. So the question is how can we join different teams or a different project within the project? Because the turning way is kind of a community of communities, everyone uses different tools as you all may be familiar in the source world, of course. The translation team specifically has a channel on Slack and weekly meetings that they host. And as for getting involved, it's honestly just looking at the GitHub repository. We have folks that just join and look at issues for new chapters that are being written, pitch ideas. We had one recently, I think, on an open infrastructure chapter that's ongoing and a bunch of other things like that. So the translation team, the French team in particular, is very, very cool. They're all wonderful. I'll be with the community that celebrates this project and the turning way. And other things to scale it. If maybe the community grows a lot, did the thing you do now, did they be still okay after? Did you imagine a way to make it work with a very, very big community and a lot of researchers all around the world? So the question is how do you negotiate or like navigate the scaling of the community and of the project? Given all of the network researchers that are here today, we ourselves are trying to understand maybe a network of what the turning way project would look like because we sometimes find it excited in some government document months down the line, which means that there's a long tail or folks that might use templates of the project or might cite it in different spaces that we can't necessarily keep track of. There's maybe two answers to that question. One is that as the community manager, I think a lot about maintenance and sustainability and how maintainers are often such a small percentage of those who write or those who create. And my priority is really trying to ensure that there's sustainability there as that inevitable kind of growth happens perhaps. But the other side of it is I think a process of translation. We recently received a grant to work with practitioners in implementing turning way principles or things that are cited in the book in industry or other research environments. And I think a lot of that work is going to be how can we kind of build bridges between in a very non-trivial way as I think a trope like building bridges sounds like, but rather like translate the work of open research principles into something that an industry person would be able to apply within their work. And I'll just, I think it will be difficult, but that can't be at the expense of the maintainers. What research has been found in a very, very big industry? So have you seen this kind of self-organising of communities feeding through the decisions that are made? Would you be able to repeat that last part? You said, have you, with large research? That's a very interesting question, which was, if you want to change research culture and with very large research teams, have you seen, like have you seen principles like what is in the turning way applied within these groups? Am I reading you right there? If anything, I think if there's anything that the folks in the community have observed, which is why a kind of collective documentation project has emerged, is that everyone's looking to reinvent the wheel. And something like the turning way emerged out of this need to go, hey, we're both on massive research teams. We both are kind of trying to do the same thing. Why don't we just template it? Or why don't we talk about it? Why don't we create a set of best practices that, of course, isn't the best, but rather something that both of us can use? And so I think if there's anything that what the project is trying to aim for is trying to help with that templating process so that we're not constantly reinventing the wheel when we are in massive research projects or in different groups. Because that, of course, is you all are probably aware happens all the time. Yeah, I hope that answers your question. Yeah, thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.1, "text": " Hello everyone, my name is Ann and I'll be talking to you about changing culture, research", "tokens": [50364,
