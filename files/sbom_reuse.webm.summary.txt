In this talk, Linus discussed the reuse tool, which helps to ease compliance issues with Free and Open Source Software by automatically adding license and copyright information to source code, enabling compliance checks and providing tools to help developers keep track. The license information can be stored in the repo, rather than in a separate silo, making the whole process simpler. It is also compatible with existing practices and provides an API and badges.
