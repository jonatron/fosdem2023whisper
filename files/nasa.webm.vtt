WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Thank you very much for having me here at FOSSTEM.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.120
This is my first FOSSTEM and as part of the feedback from the organizers for my talk was

00:14.120 --> 00:20.120
it sounds like something that could be enough the great way to end the meeting with lots

00:20.120 --> 00:24.320
of pretty pictures and I've done my best to fill this with lots of pretty pictures and

00:24.320 --> 00:27.920
so hopefully I'll meet the expectations.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.240
I'm Steve Crawford.

00:29.240 --> 00:34.200
I'm the Science Data Officer as part of the Chief Science Data Office of the Science Mission

00:34.200 --> 00:40.000
Directorate of NASA and I'm really excited here today to talk to you about NASA and open

00:40.000 --> 00:42.960
source software.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.000
And so just to give a little preview of what I'll be talking about I'll start off with

00:48.000 --> 00:54.760
software and the importance of it to NASA, recent open source software success stories,

00:54.760 --> 01:02.000
challenges with open software, open source science and then opportunities.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.400
And I think probably most everyone is familiar with NASA but I want to share with you that

01:10.400 --> 01:16.440
NASA's vision is to reach new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of all

01:16.440 --> 01:17.440
humankind.

01:17.440 --> 01:21.480
And this image is I think a great encapsulation of this.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.560
Going to the moon was obviously reaching new heights.

01:24.560 --> 01:30.000
And this image of Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11 mission landing on the moon but it captures

01:30.000 --> 01:33.760
him actually in the act of a science experiment.

01:33.760 --> 01:39.200
They're actually capturing information about the solar winds on the surface of the moon

01:39.200 --> 01:43.320
and actually trying to better understand how our sun works and interacts with the different

01:43.320 --> 01:47.520
bodies and trying to actually explore heat of physics which is one of the main areas

01:47.520 --> 01:49.640
we do research on.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.160
And so that is actually a key bit of NASA.

01:52.160 --> 01:57.680
Not only to explore the universe and to explore our solar system and our atmosphere but also

01:57.680 --> 01:59.440
to actually understand it.

01:59.440 --> 02:05.200
And so trying to actually understand for the benefit of everyone is a key part of NASA.

02:05.200 --> 02:13.080
And at the heart of that and integral part of that and what makes NASA possible is software.

02:13.080 --> 02:18.720
Every mission, every bit of research that NASA does there's software involved in it.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.720
And a great example is the Apollo software and here's two of the people who are leaders

02:24.720 --> 02:29.840
and involved in it, Mary Jackson who started work at the computers, the very early computers

02:29.840 --> 02:36.160
as part of NASA to actually work and then became one of the lead engineers.

02:36.160 --> 02:41.360
And Margaret Hamilton who helped lead the team that was designing the control and command

02:41.360 --> 02:45.040
software for the Apollo 11 mission at MIT.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.120
And this software is actually released and made openly available.

02:49.120 --> 02:54.680
You can see an example of the scan of one of the early software.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.000
It's available online.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.280
It's also been converted to GitHub if you actually want to actually take a look at the

03:00.280 --> 03:02.800
software and the code from the Apollo mission.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.360
It's there and available.

03:05.360 --> 03:10.560
Software has been a key part for all of our different missions but NASA also has a long

03:10.560 --> 03:15.560
history of making the software openly available.

03:15.560 --> 03:22.120
And that sharing is part of NASA's DNA as part of the law that created NASA, the space

03:22.120 --> 03:23.960
act.

03:23.960 --> 03:29.360
In section 203, one of the aspects was to provide for the widest, practical and appropriate

03:29.360 --> 03:34.600
dissemination of information concerning its activities and results thereof.

03:34.600 --> 03:43.120
Part of our congressionally mandated law is to actually share what we do and disseminate

03:43.120 --> 03:44.520
appropriately.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.720
We do always have to be concerned about security and keeping things safe.

03:48.720 --> 03:53.200
But we also want to actually share as much possible as we do.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.560
And today we're doing that through our different directorates.

03:56.560 --> 04:02.720
We have our exploration systems directorate with Artemis, launching and aiming to go back

04:02.720 --> 04:05.560
to the moon and then Mars beyond it.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.320
We have our space operations mission directorate which is actually focused on the international

04:09.320 --> 04:13.320
space station and about operations and living in space.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.920
We have our science mission directorate which I'm part of which actually explores our universe

04:16.920 --> 04:18.800
and our earth.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.520
And we also have our space technology and aeronautics research mission directorates which actually

04:22.520 --> 04:27.880
are designing the technology that enable the exploration and discoveries made by the other

04:27.880 --> 04:28.880
directorates.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.040
I'm not focused most of the rest of my talk on the science mission directorate but a lot

04:33.040 --> 04:38.560
of what I say for SMD also applies to these other activities.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.080
And so what does the science mission directorate do?

04:41.080 --> 04:44.520
Well, it has three key science themes.

04:44.520 --> 04:50.720
These are to protect and improve life on earth and space, search for life elsewhere and that

04:50.720 --> 04:57.920
can be either within the solar system or planets circling around other stars and discover the

04:57.920 --> 05:00.240
secrets of the universe.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.800
And so these are three, I think it's fair to say, pretty big questions that affect all

05:04.800 --> 05:06.800
of humanity.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.280
And that's what we're actually working at in the science mission directorate to try and

05:10.280 --> 05:13.560
answer these questions.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.560
And how do we do that?

05:14.560 --> 05:17.240
Well, we do it through our fleet of missions.

05:17.240 --> 05:21.560
And so these are the different missions that the science mission directorate have in orbit

05:21.560 --> 05:27.640
around the earth, have in orbit around other planets or the sun or have exploring the universe.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.640
And we have a wide range of earth-observing satellites.

05:30.640 --> 05:36.440
We have a number of experiments going on on the International Space Station.

05:36.440 --> 05:41.920
We have a wide range of different explorers that have visited Mars.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.840
We also have observations of the sun.

05:44.840 --> 05:49.480
And we have our space telescopes and our space observatories observing the deepest reaches

05:49.480 --> 05:50.480
of the universe.

05:50.480 --> 05:55.320
And I just want to take a pause though as I take a look at and a very important aspect

05:55.320 --> 06:00.440
of this chart is that a lot of these missions, actually all of these missions, are done with

06:00.440 --> 06:01.440
our partners.

06:01.440 --> 06:07.000
NASA, even though NASA, everyone knows the NASA name and the NASA brand, so much of what

06:07.000 --> 06:09.320
NASA does is with others.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.840
It's with the community.

06:10.840 --> 06:15.240
We do it with our partners at the European Space Agency, at the Canadian Space Agency,

06:15.240 --> 06:16.440
at JAXA.

06:16.440 --> 06:21.440
We do it with the contractors and other agencies which are around the world that we partner

06:21.440 --> 06:22.440
with and work with.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.440
And we also do it with the wider community.

06:25.440 --> 06:30.360
Some of these missions are NASA-led, some are led by our partners.

06:30.360 --> 06:35.760
But really, I think there's actually one aspect which is actually very similar to open source

06:35.760 --> 06:42.720
where the missions and projects with NASA do take a very wide community in order to actually

06:42.720 --> 06:46.440
achieve these projects.

06:46.440 --> 06:51.520
And so I want to actually look at some of the success stories with these projects.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.880
And the first one I want to take a look at is Ingenuity.

06:53.880 --> 06:59.960
I'm going to play Ingenuity as part of the Mars Preserverance mission.

06:59.960 --> 07:06.360
Mars Preserverance is on the surface of Mars, it landed there in 2021, to explore Jezero

07:06.360 --> 07:10.160
Crater, an ancient delta on Mars.

07:10.160 --> 07:17.160
This was an area that was once rich with water and was sent there to actually explore whether

07:17.160 --> 07:19.800
or not the potential for life in that area.

07:19.800 --> 07:24.800
As part of that mission, there's a demonstrator on it which is the Ingenuity drone copter.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.240
And you can see the first flight of it here.

07:27.240 --> 07:34.840
And this is the first flight of a human-made object anywhere else in the solar system.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.360
And so we're actually flying a copter on another planet.

07:39.360 --> 07:48.200
Since the first flight, it's been repeated and has flown over 40 separate flights during

07:48.200 --> 07:51.160
the last two years, it's still flying, it's still exploring.

07:51.160 --> 07:54.520
This was something that I was expected to make about five flights and I'll just play

07:54.520 --> 07:56.440
that again.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.720
But it's driven by open-source software.

07:58.720 --> 08:05.000
F prime is the open-source flight control software for this and this framework was used for this

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
project.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.600
It was released by JPL in 2017 and so this drone copter is flown by open-source software.

08:14.600 --> 08:23.880
One of the great things that happened to celebrate this accomplishment is that NASA and JPL partnered

08:23.880 --> 08:29.080
with GitHub to actually recognize all those who have contributed to this mission.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.480
And they didn't actually just to those who actually contributed to the F prime repository,

08:33.480 --> 08:40.920
they also contributed and recognized all the others through a badge of the Mars 2020 helicopter

08:40.920 --> 08:49.720
badge, which recognized all the dependencies and all the other packages and software that

08:49.720 --> 08:54.280
was involved and part of this project.

08:54.280 --> 08:59.000
And so this actually was over 12,000 people who contributed to these dependencies and

08:59.000 --> 09:02.720
these different packages which made this project possible.

09:02.720 --> 09:08.040
These contributors are from all around the world and have been contributing to open-source

09:08.040 --> 09:15.720
and a wide range of different open-source projects which made flight on Mars possible.

09:15.720 --> 09:25.040
Another project and this one is personally important to me because it's one that I've

09:25.040 --> 09:28.880
contributed directly to is the JPS Web Space Telescope.

09:28.880 --> 09:34.680
This was launched just over a year ago and it is a partnership between NASA, European

09:34.680 --> 09:38.120
Space Agency, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency.

09:38.120 --> 09:43.160
And I really want to actually once again actually like emphasize the fact that these projects,

09:43.160 --> 09:49.320
these massive projects which took almost 30 years to build was an international collaboration

09:49.320 --> 09:56.120
with a wide range of different agencies across different NASA centers, 14 different countries

09:56.120 --> 10:03.800
including Belgium right here, part of the Meary spectrograph was built here in Belgium, along

10:03.800 --> 10:08.240
with actually one of the leads for the Meary spectrograph of the Law Resolution spectrograph,

10:08.240 --> 10:13.000
Sarah Kendra was actually born and raised in Belgium.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.720
And so these projects take a wide range and a large community to actually support and

10:20.720 --> 10:24.720
actually produce these projects.

10:24.720 --> 10:30.480
And so the wonderful and beautiful thing is that after its launch and after its commissioning,

10:30.480 --> 10:34.920
James Web Space Telescope did start to produce beautiful, beautiful images.

10:34.920 --> 10:39.200
And so Jade was tea as here is one of the first images of the Karina Nebula.

10:39.200 --> 10:46.200
This is a small part of the overall image or small part of the overall Nebula showing

10:46.200 --> 10:53.640
the dust clouds which are actually home to new stars which are forming there.

10:53.640 --> 10:57.560
And not only is it producing imaging but it's also producing spectra and this is an example

10:57.560 --> 11:03.800
and one of the first spectra of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting another

11:03.800 --> 11:04.800
star.

11:04.800 --> 11:09.200
So it's in the atmosphere of a plant which is orbiting another star and it's detected

11:09.200 --> 11:14.520
by the spectrograph and by looking at as that planet passes in front of the star, you

11:14.520 --> 11:19.520
can actually do observations of it, you subtract off the effects of the star and you can actually

11:19.520 --> 11:24.080
see what the spectrum of that atmosphere of that planet is.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.960
This is the first detection of CO2.

11:25.960 --> 11:30.240
And this came out roughly about a month after we started producing public data from the

11:30.240 --> 11:32.360
telescope as we started releasing data.

11:32.360 --> 11:37.320
And here's a great quote from Natasha Patalia who is one of the leads on it, that NASA's

11:37.320 --> 11:41.320
open science guidance principles are centered in our early release science work supporting

11:41.320 --> 11:45.320
an inclusive, transparent and collaborative scientific process.

11:45.320 --> 11:49.760
They could actually produce their science so quickly in one month, this discovery one

11:49.760 --> 11:55.320
month after they started releasing data because of open science and open source software.

11:55.320 --> 12:00.920
They're able to test their software and their processes before the launch of the telescope

12:00.920 --> 12:04.400
because all of the calibration software was made publicly available.

12:04.400 --> 12:09.600
The data for this project, for our early release projects were made publicly available as soon

12:09.600 --> 12:12.360
as they were observed.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.800
And they also are a great example of open science as well.

12:15.800 --> 12:21.080
They've made all of their data, all of their software and all of their results openly accessible

12:21.080 --> 12:22.080
as well.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.680
So if you want to actually go and reproduce this spectra for yourselves, you can actually

12:25.680 --> 12:32.000
go and download their software which is uploaded to Zenodo and take a look at it.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.320
And so as I said, this is all made possible by having the software made openly available

12:37.320 --> 12:41.000
and this is part of all of the JVC calibration software.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.440
The software which is actually used to actually produce and science calibration and science

12:47.440 --> 12:52.440
ready images is all openly developed, all openly developed on GitHub.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.160
It enables scientists to test their projects before it became available but also allows

12:56.160 --> 13:00.720
them to feed back to the project to actually when they find bugs or when they find a better

13:00.720 --> 13:05.560
algorithm for calibrating the data, they can contribute it back to the program so that

13:05.560 --> 13:09.960
it actually can then be shared with a wider audience.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.000
And one thing that actually makes this available is it builds on the wider scientific Python

13:14.000 --> 13:18.680
environment and then contributes back to that community as well.

13:18.680 --> 13:23.840
And the way that this did it was it contributes in JVC and that team contributes back to the

13:23.840 --> 13:28.520
AstroPy project and this is a common Python library for astronomy.

13:28.520 --> 13:34.520
It builds on NumPy and it started in 2011 basically from an astronomy and Python mailing

13:34.520 --> 13:36.400
list.

13:36.400 --> 13:41.240
People have been actually emailing on the list saying I've just released a new generalized

13:41.240 --> 13:45.600
package for astronomy and after about the third email someone said why don't we all

13:45.600 --> 13:47.760
work together?

13:47.760 --> 13:52.600
And basically everyone did actually agree to that and we ended up getting together and

13:52.600 --> 13:58.400
working together to produce a generalized astronomy package and not only was it graduate

13:58.400 --> 14:03.080
students and software engineers and astronomers from around the world but it also included

14:03.080 --> 14:06.960
those software engineers and astronomers working on some of our biggest projects like the Hubble

14:06.960 --> 14:10.760
Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

14:10.760 --> 14:15.520
Since it's actually released it's been used in over 10,000 publications making it really

14:15.520 --> 14:19.080
widely available and widely used.

14:19.080 --> 14:24.000
But we do have, you know, and on the images from their recent paper of showing actually

14:24.000 --> 14:28.920
where it's being used and where it's available and you can see it's all over the world but

14:28.920 --> 14:36.680
along with that the dots on the graphic represent where the maintainers from the project are,

14:36.680 --> 14:40.840
where the people who have been contributing to the project and they're spread out through

14:40.840 --> 14:47.640
both North America and Europe with some South American and Global South representation

14:47.640 --> 14:50.640
as well.

14:50.640 --> 14:55.080
And so I'm just going to pause again here and I'm going to put up another JVC early

14:55.080 --> 15:03.000
release image which is the Galaxy Cluster SMAC 0723 and this image also has a lot of

15:03.000 --> 15:07.680
importance to me because when I was doing my PhD in astronomy I studied objects which

15:07.680 --> 15:09.280
were very similar to this.

15:09.280 --> 15:13.920
Galaxy clusters are some of the largest, they are the largest gravitationally bound objects

15:13.920 --> 15:14.920
in the universe.

15:14.920 --> 15:20.880
They're the most massive objects having billions and billions of solar masses of billion

15:20.880 --> 15:25.760
billions times more massive than our own sun and are the largest collections of objects.

15:25.760 --> 15:31.000
And what you're seeing in this image is not only the galaxies which are part of this cluster

15:31.000 --> 15:33.760
but you're also seeing the effects of general relativity.

15:33.760 --> 15:38.120
They're bending the light from the galaxies which are behind them.

15:38.120 --> 15:43.160
Only a few hundred million or billion years older than the big bang and they're bending

15:43.160 --> 15:50.120
that light due to the mass, the mass of that galaxy is warping the space and time around

15:50.120 --> 15:54.480
it to focus those light on those background galaxies on us and we're seeing that through

15:54.480 --> 15:58.360
those galaxies which are streaked and bent around it.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.680
These are the background galaxies around it.

16:00.680 --> 16:04.800
And as I said, during my PhD I studied objects like this, galaxy clusters.

16:04.800 --> 16:11.320
When I was writing my PhD I wrote code in C and in pearl and I would put it into a tarball

16:11.320 --> 16:14.880
and put it up on my own personal website.

16:14.880 --> 16:21.000
And after I had gotten my PhD and I actually moved down to South Africa to work on a telescope

16:21.000 --> 16:24.960
there called the Southern African Large Telescope and I had to build a data management system

16:24.960 --> 16:27.520
for it except we had no resources.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.840
I was the only resource.

16:29.840 --> 16:34.640
And so I turned to the open source software, I turned to free software to actually use

16:34.640 --> 16:41.480
a wide variety of resources to build a very, very cost effective data management system

16:41.480 --> 16:42.880
for it.

16:42.880 --> 16:48.160
And it actually helped make it one of the most productive 10 meter class telescopes.

16:48.160 --> 16:52.360
But during that time was when I was working down there when I received that email about

16:52.360 --> 16:57.160
Astropi and it was, you know, this is my actual, even though I'd been releasing software,

16:57.160 --> 17:02.400
this was really my start into open source software where it actually is getting involved

17:02.400 --> 17:07.400
of a community of like-minded people who I've actually solved a similar problem.

17:07.400 --> 17:11.360
And it was really actually when I saw the potential of actually working together and

17:11.360 --> 17:15.640
sharing our software and how we did things that I actually really saw the power of open

17:15.640 --> 17:17.800
source software.

17:17.800 --> 17:24.520
And you know, that's actually then, and if you told me about 10 years ago or so that

17:24.520 --> 17:29.640
I'd be here talking to you now having actually worked in South Africa for a while and then

17:29.640 --> 17:34.440
moved on to work and manage the team that was developing the JST calibration software.

17:34.440 --> 17:40.640
And now working at NASA sharing open science across all of our different divisions and

17:40.640 --> 17:45.320
helping to further open the science, I wouldn't have actually believed you if you told me

17:45.320 --> 17:49.320
that 10 years ago that this is where getting involved in open source would have actually

17:49.320 --> 17:54.720
eventually led me to, but I'm here now and it's been actually really, really fascinating

17:54.720 --> 18:00.440
to hear all of the immense and fantastic open source work which has been going on at this

18:00.440 --> 18:01.440
conference.

18:01.440 --> 18:07.080
But I just want to actually show, you know, going back to what NASA does, this is less

18:07.080 --> 18:10.320
than 1% of the open source used by NASA.

18:10.320 --> 18:15.200
This is just a, basically NASA and the wide range of NASA projects is touching on just

18:15.200 --> 18:18.840
about every bit of open source that you can imagine.

18:18.840 --> 18:24.440
Likewise, NASA and the people working at NASA release a huge amount of open source.

18:24.440 --> 18:29.640
This is less than 1% of the open source that's being released by NASA and it's a wide range

18:29.640 --> 18:37.000
of different projects touching on both planetary science, astronomy, heliophysics, earth science

18:37.000 --> 18:41.680
along with technology development and other aspects.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.480
NASA loves to actually spin off the things that we're doing.

18:44.480 --> 18:50.440
NASTRAN was a program for engineering and fine element analysis developed in the 60s

18:50.440 --> 18:53.000
and released as public domain in the 70s.

18:53.000 --> 19:00.240
It now underlines, it still underlines a number of engineering codes which are out there and

19:00.240 --> 19:07.240
Ode Engineering Software which is out there, but NASA loves to actually spin out our projects.

19:07.240 --> 19:13.960
Another two examples of our spin offs is OpenStack which is underlying on-premise cloud

19:13.960 --> 19:15.360
computing.

19:15.360 --> 19:21.040
We still use this in our Adapt Supercomputer Center and for our on-premise cloud computing

19:21.040 --> 19:28.200
it's still often used, but with Rackspace we've handed this over to the community and

19:28.200 --> 19:30.640
to the wider community to further develop.

19:30.640 --> 19:35.720
OODT is another program that was developed for data management and for handling files

19:35.720 --> 19:40.840
likewise handed over to the Apache Foundation for that to be further developed to the community.

19:40.840 --> 19:46.680
NASA is still a participant in it, NASA still uses some of this software, but we are now

19:46.680 --> 19:52.120
just a member of a much larger community which are using these different projects.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.640
But sometimes it's still important for us to actually take the lead and develop our

19:55.640 --> 20:00.560
software ourselves and the JPL Spice Toolkit is an example of this.

20:00.560 --> 20:05.880
This is for spacecraft ephemeris, planet satellite comet or asteroid ephemeris, instrument

20:05.880 --> 20:10.240
information, orientation information and events information.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.960
This is a software that you use if you want to know where a comet or an asteroid that

20:13.960 --> 20:16.640
you want to land on will be in 10 years.

20:16.640 --> 20:21.200
This is how we actually determine the positions and velocities of spacecraft, of planets,

20:21.200 --> 20:26.040
of other objects which are all moving throughout our solar system.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.400
This software needs to be incredibly precise.

20:28.400 --> 20:33.040
If you get something wrong now in a very small amount and you try and land on your comet

20:33.040 --> 20:39.360
in 10 years you will be nowhere close to it and you will have no hope of recovering.

20:39.360 --> 20:44.400
And so there actually is a very, very rigorous process to actually contribute and to actually

20:44.400 --> 20:45.880
make changes to this code.

20:45.880 --> 20:51.200
It's made very slowly, very carefully because once again if you even get the floating points

20:51.200 --> 20:55.480
a little bit off or depending on even how the hardware works or specific hardware you

20:55.480 --> 20:57.760
may get different results.

20:57.760 --> 21:01.640
And there is actually, and it was primarily originally developed in C and they did release

21:01.640 --> 21:07.320
some other interfaces for it and it is released as open source but it's not openly developed

21:07.320 --> 21:08.320
currently.

21:08.320 --> 21:15.040
It's something funded by the planetary data system and so there is actually regular support

21:15.040 --> 21:21.120
for it and it's a great team that is currently further developing it.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.600
But there's also wrappers that have been developed for it.

21:23.600 --> 21:31.080
And Andrew Annex developed SpicePy which is a Python wrapper for this toolkit and it's

21:31.080 --> 21:33.120
been used in a wide range of different missions.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.800
It's actually now used by 80% of all Spice users.

21:36.800 --> 21:42.960
It's been used in Consini of the Mars Orbiter.

21:42.960 --> 21:47.480
It's very widely used in our range of different missions.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.960
But Andrew developed this when he was an undergraduate.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.480
He was working on the Consini mission and probably like a lot of people he just wanted

21:53.480 --> 21:57.880
to use Spice and Python and at the time there wasn't a way to do it and so he solved the

21:57.880 --> 21:59.240
problem.

21:59.240 --> 22:03.640
He developed and released it as open source software and everyone else started using it

22:03.640 --> 22:04.880
as well.

22:04.880 --> 22:08.760
And Andrew continued development for two years in his spare time while he was actually post

22:08.760 --> 22:13.720
his undergraduate and not even employed working on any of the missions.

22:13.720 --> 22:18.920
Fortunately enough he did go back for his PhD and he's now currently a post-socket Caltech

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920
so he's doing fine.

22:20.920 --> 22:25.920
But even though it's actually so widely used it wasn't actually clearly about how it was

22:25.920 --> 22:33.320
being funded or the limited recognition for example not very cited in the community even

22:33.320 --> 22:38.760
though it's actually becoming so critical to many projects that we're actually actively

22:38.760 --> 22:39.920
using it.

22:39.920 --> 22:44.680
And so that gets us to some of the challenges of NASA and open source.

22:44.680 --> 22:49.680
And so as I mentioned one thing there was a good challenge of how do we actually go

22:49.680 --> 22:55.120
from something which is just being developed as someone trying to solve their own problem

22:55.120 --> 22:57.720
but then ends up being widely used in the community.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.280
How do we actually develop that model?

23:00.280 --> 23:02.480
NASA also contributes.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.840
People working at NASA also contribute to open source.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.960
Here's Leo Singer just last week contributing to an open source project because he needed

23:08.960 --> 23:15.000
to fix it and fix a bug in it to make it work for his use case.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.960
But oftentimes it's not actually very clear about how that actually works for the NASA

23:18.960 --> 23:22.920
employee or the person working at NASA.

23:22.920 --> 23:27.200
And this is also not always very clear about also when we need to do things like sign contributor

23:27.200 --> 23:30.680
license agreements or other aspects how that works.

23:30.680 --> 23:35.880
And so sometimes often people working on NASA will do it so they get it done but it's not

23:35.880 --> 23:40.360
really clear about how they should be doing it.

23:40.360 --> 23:48.720
There's also licensing at NASA and about 20 years ago NASA created the NASA open source

23:48.720 --> 23:52.840
agreement and they're trying to solve a very specific problem.

23:52.840 --> 24:00.280
Civil servants, by US law civil servants can't produce work that is copyrightable.

24:00.280 --> 24:04.360
So open source licenses actually work based on copyright.

24:04.360 --> 24:10.520
And so if you're not allowed to produce something that's copyrightable that you can copyright,

24:10.520 --> 24:15.880
you can't use an existing open source license to actually protect it.

24:15.880 --> 24:20.200
They came up with the, and there really wasn't much guidance in the US government at that

24:20.200 --> 24:23.360
time about releasing as open source software.

24:23.360 --> 24:28.280
And so they came up with actually a relatively innovative solution at the time which is this

24:28.280 --> 24:34.520
NOSA license to actually enable civil servants to release their software as open source following

24:34.520 --> 24:35.520
this framework.

24:35.520 --> 24:40.600
Unfortunately, it wasn't widely recognized in the community, it is not recognized by

24:40.600 --> 24:47.160
the Free Software Foundation and it does complicate the reuse of NASA software.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.080
We also have bureaucracy at NASA.

24:49.080 --> 24:54.000
NASA is a very large government agency.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.720
And sometimes even though NASA does have a process of releasing software and it's released

24:58.720 --> 25:04.920
over 500, officially released over 500 open source packages, the processes can be long.

25:04.920 --> 25:09.400
We also not always best in engaging with the open source community and here's a tweet from

25:09.400 --> 25:15.720
Daniel Steinberg about getting emails from NASA asking us, or asking him about the status

25:15.720 --> 25:22.600
of Curl and whether or not it can be actually used in different ways.

25:22.600 --> 25:26.160
And that's an additional burden for people who may be actually working on this in their

25:26.160 --> 25:29.040
volunteer time or not being paid.

25:29.040 --> 25:33.560
If we actually have to figure out if the software is secure or what the risks associated with

25:33.560 --> 25:38.920
that software are, that should be our responsibility, but actually how that works with the open

25:38.920 --> 25:45.560
source framework and open source communities can be actually different aspects.

25:45.560 --> 25:50.160
But Curl is actually something which is critical, especially to our data management systems.

25:50.160 --> 25:53.600
It's being used very widely across NASA.

25:53.600 --> 25:58.160
And how that actually comes into play and in different places ends up being something

25:58.160 --> 26:02.320
that we have to actually figure out how to actually resolve and actually make sure that

26:02.320 --> 26:07.600
the software that we're using is being used appropriately.

26:07.600 --> 26:12.240
And I think there was a great talk earlier today on the security of software by Brian

26:12.240 --> 26:18.160
Bellandoff and that's going to be an ongoing question about how to answer that.

26:18.160 --> 26:24.760
And I always put up this XKCD comic on sustainability of open source software because it's better

26:24.760 --> 26:29.920
than if I could write 10 white papers and it won't have the same effect as this to actually

26:29.920 --> 26:35.240
indicate sometimes the problems and issues around sustainability.

26:35.240 --> 26:42.160
And that all of our open source systems, or not maybe not all of them, but a lot of them

26:42.160 --> 26:47.360
do actually develop or depend on a small number of developers who are actually maintaining

26:47.360 --> 26:50.560
it and keeping the code active and working.

26:50.560 --> 26:58.600
And there is actually, there was a great talk yesterday on the sustainability of open source

26:58.600 --> 27:06.720
and NASA does need reliable, secure software, especially for our space operations.

27:06.720 --> 27:09.360
And so what are we doing for the next steps?

27:09.360 --> 27:13.880
And within the science mission director, we've actually started up a couple of new things

27:13.880 --> 27:17.720
to actually help with this and help address some of these challenges.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.800
We've recently set up the chief science data office, which I'm part of.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.760
And as part of that, we've set up the open source science initiative.

27:23.760 --> 27:28.920
This is one part of it is to help actually support open source software at NASA.

27:28.920 --> 27:35.520
The other part of it is also helping to extend open science across the entire mission directorate.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.640
And so what is open science?

27:37.640 --> 27:41.800
Open science is a principle and practice of making research products and processes available

27:41.800 --> 27:47.080
to all while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering

27:47.080 --> 27:51.680
collaborations, reproducibility, and equity.

27:51.680 --> 27:55.960
And we really are focused on increasing accessibility, reproducibility, and inclusion when we're

27:55.960 --> 28:02.400
actually working on open science across NASA.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.600
But within SMD, we want to take that a step further.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.480
And this is why we started the open source science in practice.

28:08.480 --> 28:12.040
We definitely want to take, not only just make our products openly available, but we

28:12.040 --> 28:16.680
want to take the processes of science and open those up in much of the way of open source

28:16.680 --> 28:18.400
software development.

28:18.400 --> 28:22.360
We want to open the entirety of the scientific process from start to finish.

28:22.360 --> 28:26.400
We want to broaden community involvement in the scientific process, increase accessibility

28:26.400 --> 28:30.680
of our data, software, and publications, and facilitate inclusion, transparency, and

28:30.680 --> 28:34.760
reproducibility of science.

28:34.760 --> 28:41.760
And so with the NASA's open source science initiative, it is supporting scientists to

28:41.760 --> 28:47.280
integrate open science principles into the entirety of their research workflow.

28:47.280 --> 28:52.720
The NASA's OSSI is $20 million per year, and we're hoping to actually increase that

28:52.720 --> 28:57.360
further effort to increase open science across NASA.

28:57.360 --> 29:02.640
We have four areas that we're mainly focusing on, which is infrastructure, policy, funding,

29:02.640 --> 29:04.800
and community.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.800
I'm going to touch on some of the work that we're doing in these three, at least the three

29:08.800 --> 29:11.640
different areas.

29:11.640 --> 29:15.320
And so one thing is new policy.

29:15.320 --> 29:19.280
And so last month, we've released the SMD's new policy on scientific information.

29:19.280 --> 29:24.760
We want to make things as open as possible, as restricted as necessary, and always secure.

29:24.760 --> 29:30.240
And this new policy says that our publications, the research which is done and funded by NASA,

29:30.240 --> 29:34.560
are made openly available with no period of embargo.

29:34.560 --> 29:38.880
That our research data and software are shared at the time of publication, that they are

29:38.880 --> 29:44.240
made openly so that you can reproduce the science which is actually being done from

29:44.240 --> 29:50.400
our work, and that you're able to actually also then reuse that science to actually build

29:50.400 --> 29:51.400
on it.

29:51.400 --> 29:55.680
That our mission data are released as soon as possible and freely available.

29:55.680 --> 30:02.000
And that free is actually both in free as in beer, there's no charge to actually using

30:02.000 --> 30:08.800
our data, we make it free to download, free to access that data, and free as in speech

30:08.800 --> 30:12.560
as there's no restriction in what you can do with that data.

30:12.560 --> 30:17.880
And so that you can actually go and do whatever you want with the data we release, and that

30:17.880 --> 30:22.920
that data will be released under a Creative Commons zero license, so it's clearly in the

30:22.920 --> 30:25.720
public domain for everyone.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.320
That our unrestricted mission software is developed openly, we've learned these lessons

30:29.320 --> 30:34.480
from JVST that having that software available for everyone to actually be able to both have

30:34.480 --> 30:39.040
access to it and also reuse it improves how science is done.

30:39.040 --> 30:43.240
That we recognize software as a scientific product, our software is just as critical

30:43.240 --> 30:45.040
to our research.

30:45.040 --> 30:49.640
And that we'll be using these common open source licenses like Creative Commons zero

30:49.640 --> 30:55.360
for our data and permissive commonly used software licenses for our software like Apache,

30:55.360 --> 30:58.640
BSD, or MIT licenses.

30:58.640 --> 31:03.640
And we encourage using and contributing to open source software as part of our missions

31:03.640 --> 31:04.640
and our research.

31:04.640 --> 31:10.600
We're actually going to be also releasing further policies and updating further processes

31:10.600 --> 31:19.400
to make it easier for NASA employees and NASA people working with NASA to contribute

31:19.400 --> 31:25.280
release and use open source software, so there's more coming to make it easier.

31:25.280 --> 31:28.960
The other thing is we're directly funding open source software, especially in the scientific

31:28.960 --> 31:29.960
environment.

31:29.960 --> 31:36.560
In over the last two years we've selected over 16 proposals supporting 22 different projects

31:36.560 --> 31:38.800
which we're providing direct support to.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.880
This call was specifically for sustainability.

31:41.880 --> 31:47.720
We weren't asking for anything new, we weren't asking for new features or new products, what

31:47.720 --> 31:55.200
we were asking was please make sure this software works as best as you can and that's sustainable,

31:55.200 --> 31:59.520
that we can actually continue to use this and we've supported this with over three million

31:59.520 --> 32:03.520
dollars so far.

32:03.520 --> 32:07.680
We're also, and this is the next thing that we're kicking off this year, is NASA's Transform

32:07.680 --> 32:08.960
to Open Science.

32:08.960 --> 32:14.360
There's some stickers that already I think have disappeared very quickly, but the NASA

32:14.360 --> 32:19.400
TOPS effort is a 40 million five-year mission to accelerate adoption of open science.

32:19.400 --> 32:26.360
We're aiming to train 20,000 researchers to earn a NASA open science badge and certification

32:26.360 --> 32:29.560
which includes how to open source your software.

32:29.560 --> 32:34.360
We want to double the participation of historically excluded groups across NASA science and we

32:34.360 --> 32:38.240
want to enable five major scientific discoveries through open science principles.

32:38.240 --> 32:43.440
And we're going to do this through engagement, capacity sharing, incentives and coordination

32:43.440 --> 32:45.120
across the community.

32:45.120 --> 32:49.360
We're also following our own advice here, everything that we're doing with this project

32:49.360 --> 32:54.840
is going to be open sourced on GitHub so that community members can contribute it and we're

32:54.840 --> 33:00.000
kicking this all off with a year of open science of 2023.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.680
And this is the start of the project.

33:03.680 --> 33:09.000
As I said, it's all going to be up on GitHub, definitely please check it out and please

33:09.000 --> 33:10.640
engage with the community.

33:10.640 --> 33:17.000
But we're also not the only U.S. government agency contributing to the year of open science.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.920
Last month the White House did actually announce that 2023 would be a year of open science

33:21.920 --> 33:26.240
and there's going to be more stuff being announced by other U.S. agencies as well and we hope

33:26.240 --> 33:32.120
actually as many of you who are interested in science also take step forward to actually

33:32.120 --> 33:37.360
make your science and your results more open as well.

33:37.360 --> 33:45.640
And so we wanted to also talk about the opportunities for NASA and for using open science.

33:45.640 --> 33:49.560
And one of the most important things that we do and one of the most important aspects

33:49.560 --> 33:54.880
of or most immediate aspects of the science mission directorate is our contributions to

33:54.880 --> 34:00.880
the earth, of studying the huge impacts of climate change, about how that will affect

34:00.880 --> 34:06.040
our future, issues around environmental justice and other issues.

34:06.040 --> 34:10.880
And the way we are supporting it is that we do make all of our NASA data open.

34:10.880 --> 34:15.400
We have over 70 petabytes of data which is available in the cloud and even more that's

34:15.400 --> 34:20.320
available in different systems that are open for you to use in any way that you like to

34:20.320 --> 34:23.120
help address these questions.

34:23.120 --> 34:30.280
We have open APIs to these data sets which is all developed on NASA GitHub and provide

34:30.280 --> 34:37.560
as open access to the wider community and making these available to users around the

34:37.560 --> 34:43.440
world to those who actually need the data and most impacted by it.

34:43.440 --> 34:48.680
And there's actually, I know there's a big session here on the environmental impacts

34:48.680 --> 34:52.480
and there's a great talk this morning on, and I wanted to share one of the examples

34:52.480 --> 34:57.120
from NASA which is the power project that provides solar and meteorological data sets

34:57.120 --> 35:01.520
for NASA research for supporting renewable energy and building energy efficient and

35:01.520 --> 35:03.320
agriculture needs.

35:03.320 --> 35:05.400
We have made all the data freely available.

35:05.400 --> 35:09.600
We've also partnered with AWS to make the data freely available on there so that you

35:09.600 --> 35:16.240
can have access to this almost one, and this data set to actually develop the apps to build

35:16.240 --> 35:20.920
the open source tools on top of this, to actually use it in different ways that you can.

35:20.920 --> 35:25.920
To actually answer some of the toughest questions that we have around climate change and our

35:25.920 --> 35:31.400
environment, but we're also putting actually another five petabytes of data openly available

35:31.400 --> 35:36.520
on AWS and we're also looking to provide it on other cloud providers as well so that

35:36.520 --> 35:40.880
the data is there where you need it and where you can use it, and so we're actually looking

35:40.880 --> 35:45.240
to actually put our data in places where it's most useful and to partner with as many different

35:45.240 --> 35:50.040
groups that we can to actually put that data in useful places.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.280
And this is only actually the start.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.920
What's coming up next is our Earth System Observatories, which we're doing in partnerships

35:55.920 --> 36:01.840
with the European Space Agency and JAXA that are actually going to give even a closer view

36:01.840 --> 36:06.480
of the climate effects on Earth, and actually a better study of how these different effects

36:06.480 --> 36:13.160
both on changing our surface, changing our world, changing our climate, and our different

36:13.160 --> 36:14.240
particles.

36:14.240 --> 36:19.480
These are going to produce over 600 petabytes of data, and we're going to make this all

36:19.480 --> 36:23.840
freely available and accessible to the world to be able to actually access it and look

36:23.840 --> 36:29.360
at it and build things on it to answer these questions.

36:29.360 --> 36:34.280
And so we also have a lot, as I mentioned, NASA has released already a lot of open source

36:34.280 --> 36:35.800
software.

36:35.800 --> 36:39.200
We have a number of different ways to discover what might actually be out there.

36:39.200 --> 36:43.800
Code.nasa.gov is our site for our open source software at NASA.

36:43.800 --> 36:47.560
It has over 500 projects which have been officially released.

36:47.560 --> 36:50.960
We also have just released the science discovery engine.

36:50.960 --> 36:57.880
This is actually a system to actually explore both all of our different data sets, software,

36:57.880 --> 37:02.480
and technical documents across all of the science mission directorate.

37:02.480 --> 37:07.240
It has a listing, I think, currently of about 44,000 different pieces of software that have

37:07.240 --> 37:12.640
been released by different NASA researchers and missions.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.200
We have the NASA software catalog.

37:14.200 --> 37:18.680
We also have the NASA Github, which has over 500 repositories on it, but we also have all

37:18.680 --> 37:20.360
the different partners which are on Github.

37:20.360 --> 37:28.280
JPL has their software on Github, Space Telescope, has the JBC and the Hubble software on Github.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.760
There's also a lot of other people who have posted their own NASA research software around

37:31.760 --> 37:32.760
there.

37:32.760 --> 37:35.840
We also have the Astrophysics Data Service, and you can also search the Software Heritage

37:35.840 --> 37:43.560
Archive, which is archiving a lot of software across a wide range of different domains.

37:43.560 --> 37:49.760
And so we're really actually looking ahead at the really big challenges and trying to

37:49.760 --> 37:51.640
answer the big questions.

37:51.640 --> 38:00.840
Here's the dark mission, which earlier this year impacted on an asteroid, on a Diffmorphous,

38:00.840 --> 38:04.920
which is circling around another asteroid to actually detect to see if we could actually

38:04.920 --> 38:06.760
change its trajectory.

38:06.760 --> 38:11.160
If we can actually change the directory early enough of an asteroid, we can hopefully make

38:11.160 --> 38:15.480
sure that it deflects and avoids the Earth by using, for example, the Spice Toolkit to

38:15.480 --> 38:19.280
actually study where it's actually going to be moving and predicting it.

38:19.280 --> 38:25.600
And hopefully, ideally, protect the planet and avoid the same fate as the dinosaurs.

38:25.600 --> 38:29.040
But obviously, this is all building, and this wide range is building off a wide range of

38:29.040 --> 38:31.520
open source software.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.800
And so we do need more people.

38:32.800 --> 38:37.600
We need more hands and more eyes and more brains with the diverse experiences to participate

38:37.600 --> 38:43.080
in, so we can ask the best questions and find the best solutions.

38:43.080 --> 38:47.760
And so someone had asked me on Macedon what would be the best way or how you can contribute

38:47.760 --> 38:54.440
to NASA open source, and I wanted to actually share some of the different aspects.

38:54.440 --> 38:57.720
And so you can contribute directly to NASA open source code.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.040
It's available on GitHub.

39:00.040 --> 39:05.480
You can contribute to the open source software that's maintained by our partners at JPL or

39:05.480 --> 39:12.760
at Space Telescope or at the NASA Impact Project or the NASA Development Project or a wide

39:12.760 --> 39:18.000
range of different sources or at ESA and or at other groups that are actually contributing

39:18.000 --> 39:20.960
and answering scientific questions like CERN.

39:20.960 --> 39:25.920
So you can contribute directly to the open source code.

39:25.920 --> 39:30.560
But you can also keep contributing, building, and sustaining your code.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.240
There's so much open source that NASA is using.

39:33.240 --> 39:37.360
So even just by participating in your own open source projects, you're contributing

39:37.360 --> 39:41.560
to the NASA mission.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.960
And you can also come work with us.

39:43.960 --> 39:48.920
This can either be, you know, we're always hiring, and also our partners and our contractors

39:48.920 --> 39:53.280
are always hiring, and a lot of these are great places to work on open source.

39:53.280 --> 40:00.240
And so we also have great internship programs, especially at NASA and at JPL, and also always

40:00.240 --> 40:04.120
excited to have people come work with us or come work with our partners in Europe, like

40:04.120 --> 40:06.400
the European Space Agency.

40:06.400 --> 40:10.920
We're always looking for great technical talent to help make contributions and help

40:10.920 --> 40:14.520
build our missions.

40:14.520 --> 40:21.200
And to help address these major questions that impact humanity and to have us help reach

40:21.200 --> 40:26.000
new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humanity.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.960
And whether or not we're asking questions of protect and improve life on Earth and space

40:29.960 --> 40:34.800
and trying to address questions around climate change, address questions around planetary

40:34.800 --> 40:42.000
protection, questions around environmental justice, these are important questions that

40:42.000 --> 40:43.440
affect all of us.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.680
Whether or not we're searching for life elsewhere, either searching for life in our own solar

40:46.680 --> 40:52.200
system on Mars or Europa or Venus, or searching for life around planets orbiting around other

40:52.200 --> 40:53.200
stars.

40:53.200 --> 40:57.400
And we're trying to discover the secrets of the universe, trying to understand general

40:57.400 --> 41:03.240
relativity, trying to understand how our universe, our earliest galaxies have formed,

41:03.240 --> 41:06.160
trying to understand how black holes work.

41:06.160 --> 41:11.040
These are all the types of questions that we're trying to answer here at NASA.

41:11.040 --> 41:19.240
And so I just want to stop there, and I'm almost at my end of my talk, but just actually

41:19.240 --> 41:23.760
want to end it with a little bit of audience participation.

41:23.760 --> 41:30.120
And so I do, if you did actually see during my talk, software that you contributed to,

41:30.120 --> 41:33.880
can you raise your hand?

41:33.880 --> 41:38.800
So I mean, during my talk, I could only show about 1% of the software out there.

41:38.800 --> 41:43.200
So if you actually know you actually contributed to some NASA software out there that's used

41:43.200 --> 41:46.480
by ESA or someone else, can you raise your hand?

41:46.480 --> 41:49.840
And you can see how many people are contributing to it.

41:49.840 --> 41:56.080
But as I said, there is even that wider range of software which is out there.

41:56.080 --> 42:01.800
And doing open source also means actually like being part of the community, which is

42:01.800 --> 42:08.320
actually developing guidance, developing licenses, growing the community, mentoring

42:08.320 --> 42:09.320
the community.

42:09.320 --> 42:13.160
And so if you're taking part in actually growing the open source community and governing the

42:13.160 --> 42:16.240
open source community, can you raise your hand?

42:16.240 --> 42:25.160
So if you've been working on licenses and mentoring and inclusion, and for everyone else, for those

42:25.160 --> 42:29.840
who actually want to contribute, who want to actually help us explore the universe and

42:29.840 --> 42:33.920
help reveal the unknown.

42:33.920 --> 42:40.640
And so for all of you who are building, oh, I had one last one which was for those who

42:40.640 --> 42:45.480
helped volunteer and organize this conference so I could take my moment to share NASA's

42:45.480 --> 42:47.800
message with everyone.

42:47.800 --> 42:50.600
Can you raise your hands for all those who volunteered?

42:50.600 --> 43:06.280
Because you're also helping with NASA's mission.

43:06.280 --> 43:10.880
And so for everyone who raised your hand, I just really do want to say thank you for

43:10.880 --> 43:13.160
all of your contributions.

43:13.160 --> 43:18.000
Thank you for helping us out and for those who will contribute in the future to open

43:18.000 --> 43:21.800
source and other projects, thank you for your future contributions.

43:21.800 --> 43:43.760
Thank you very much, everyone.
