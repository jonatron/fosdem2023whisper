The speaker, Derek Parker, discusses the state of Delve, a debugger for the Go programming language, at the FOSDEM conference. Delve has seen numerous releases and added support for various Go versions and operating systems. The speaker also introduces the audience to EBPF, a technology that allows for efficient tracing and debugging of Go programs. He explains how the EBPF backend improves performance compared to traditional debugging methods and demonstrates how to use it with Delve. The talk concludes with a mention of upcoming features and a reminder to provide feedback to the Delve project.
