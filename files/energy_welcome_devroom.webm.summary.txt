Nico Rikke, an active member of the energy sector and free and open source software community, discussed in his pre-recorded message at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 how free and open source software was beginning to take over the energy sector. He mentioned organizing a dedicated energy dev room at FOSDEM and the overwhelming amount of interesting proposals they received, ranging from home automation to green software and energy system modeling. Rikke highlighted that society needs solutions amidst a problem of cheap and reliable energy, and warned that the traditional installation of wind turbines and solar panels would not be enough. However, the use of free and open source software could enable mass adoption and customizations to fit specific use cases, making it a standout solution for the energy sector in which everything is in a state of change and systems need to integrate to fulfill their purpose.
