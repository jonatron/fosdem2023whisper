[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  I guess I start already because otherwise it gets boring.
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  Hi everyone.
[00:12.000 --> 00:13.000]  I'm Svante Schubert.
[00:13.000 --> 00:20.120]  I started 99 with StarFist in Hamburg and never worked on LibreOffice core StarFist
[00:20.120 --> 00:21.120]  earlier.
[00:21.120 --> 00:27.520]  But always from the beginning, although I applied a C++, other Java-based Vaptop, we
[00:27.520 --> 00:30.360]  called it a web office, right?
[00:30.360 --> 00:31.840]  And we had two and some.
[00:31.840 --> 00:37.640]  The second one was when the Golden Master came in 2011, it was cancelled, everything.
[00:37.640 --> 00:43.760]  And this library, I'm talking about the ODF toolkit, was the core of this web office and
[00:43.760 --> 00:48.960]  later on a fork from Open Exchange for another web office.
[00:48.960 --> 00:56.640]  So I worked once at the ODF standard, which is the file format, the shot frozen runtime
[00:56.640 --> 00:58.680]  that you dump and send to others.
[00:58.680 --> 01:03.480]  And the reason of the standard is to be interoperable with other things like Microsoft Office.
[01:03.480 --> 01:09.360]  Microsoft is also participating in the OASIS ODFTC.
[01:09.360 --> 01:15.440]  Okay, so far not bringing your own laptop because everything goes faster this way.
[01:15.440 --> 01:17.680]  Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[01:17.680 --> 01:23.720]  So by the way, we are three from seven members in the OASISTC.
[01:23.720 --> 01:28.720]  We are three from the Document Foundation, Regina Henshel, who is very active, and Micha
[01:28.720 --> 01:30.040]  Stahl from Atropia.
[01:30.040 --> 01:31.680]  Many thanks for Atropia for joining that.
[01:31.680 --> 01:36.320]  And Michael is also the co-maintenor of this ODF toolkit.
[01:36.320 --> 01:45.400]  And yes, sorry, Dennis, bring my laptop, please.
[01:45.400 --> 01:50.440]  Okay, so, yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, anyway.
[01:50.440 --> 01:58.680]  So the ODF toolkit is basically a Java-based, and it has two main core deliverables.
[01:58.680 --> 02:03.640]  This is the ODF DOM, and the other thing is the validator.
[02:03.640 --> 02:09.000]  And yes, I know, but gosh, here we go.
[02:09.000 --> 02:24.440]  Sorry for the inconvenience, or it's over there, sorry.
[02:24.440 --> 02:48.320]  Hi, here's something, okay, sorry, okay.
[02:48.320 --> 02:52.760]  The one thing is the core, the ODF DOM, and the online validator is the wrapper around
[02:52.760 --> 02:53.760]  it.
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.320]  It's hosted by ODF, and it's used for validating this ODF file format.
[02:58.320 --> 03:03.760]  And ODF DOM, you hear it by the name, it's not only an ODF implementation, but also
[03:03.760 --> 03:04.920]  in DOM.
[03:04.920 --> 03:09.320]  And you might know this from the browsers, and that's the browser standard, the HTML
[03:09.320 --> 03:14.160]  standard, demand that at the runtime, the browser is accessed by the DOM API, and that
[03:14.160 --> 03:19.640]  is the way that JavaScript not only runs in Firefox or Internet Explorer, but that is
[03:19.640 --> 03:23.480]  this macros are interbubble in all browsers.
[03:23.480 --> 03:26.120]  And ODF doesn't have such runtime API.
[03:26.120 --> 03:31.440]  You have either a LibreOffice macro or Microsoft Office macro, and they do not work to each
[03:31.440 --> 03:32.440]  other.
[03:32.440 --> 03:33.440]  This is a downtime.
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.800]  I don't say that we need a DOM, but there's no DOM access in LibreOffice, but it would
[03:38.800 --> 03:42.320]  be nice to have a feature API, a high-level API.
[03:42.320 --> 03:47.200]  And the reason is that we have a standard, a blueprint, the OSSTC given standard, and
[03:47.200 --> 03:51.560]  then we have this implementation where ODF is one of them, and it's hosted by ODF.
[03:51.560 --> 03:55.880]  And just in a nutshell, what is the standard defining?
[03:55.880 --> 03:58.600]  The standard blueprint is defining the zip.
[03:58.600 --> 04:02.640]  If you will have an ODT document, you can exchange the suffix, and then you suddenly
[04:02.640 --> 04:03.640]  have a zip.
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.400]  And there's different parts in the specification parts, number one introduction, number four
[04:08.400 --> 04:14.280]  formula that's not implemented here, but the zip itself is defined in the package, like
[04:14.280 --> 04:18.840]  the encryption signature, and also this meta-inf manifest, which is a content table, and you
[04:18.840 --> 04:23.400]  will find signature XML as well, and the whole XML part is one of them.
[04:23.400 --> 04:31.000]  And the reason now, the high-level goal is to have a, to close the gap between the standard,
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.840]  the blueprint, and the limitation, like want to get away from paper because you don't want
[04:35.840 --> 04:40.280]  to get, oh, here, developer, here's another 500 pages of the specification or start.
[04:40.280 --> 04:47.480]  But the idea is to generate as much as possible documentation and most of the core by this.
[04:47.480 --> 04:53.440]  And yes, ease by this development, and how it's been done, because we are generating
[04:53.440 --> 04:58.680]  from the XML, look, there are a lot of elements of the XML, but the manifest is like a set
[04:58.680 --> 05:04.920]  of content table signatures, also the manifest XML, and all of these is taken away, abstracted
[05:04.920 --> 05:06.680]  from the developers.
[05:06.680 --> 05:13.640]  So we generate the DOM tree, and type DOM tree, like for each element, attribute, we have
[05:13.640 --> 05:19.600]  a class, and an element gives you methods to what's inserted, and the default values
[05:19.600 --> 05:26.840]  are extracted from the spec, so burned soonish is like you should have a constructor from
[05:26.840 --> 05:29.680]  all the mandatory ways of the subtree, something like this.
[05:29.680 --> 05:37.040]  But there's also some gap in the, let's say, digital gap in the spec, like there's some
[05:37.040 --> 05:43.320]  formulas in the floating text saying, oh, when attribute A is active, then the attribute
[05:43.320 --> 05:49.040]  B, sorry, if it's B is present, then A become active, or there's a certain value for B.
[05:49.040 --> 05:53.400]  And these conditions, I would love to read out and generate from it the source code,
[05:53.400 --> 05:57.840]  because I don't want to type it myself with thousands of attributes.
[05:57.840 --> 06:02.440]  Another thing that is not there, because it's a lot of things, the puzzle pieces, I would
[06:02.440 --> 06:07.920]  call them feature, and this should be the feature API, everybody expect there's an image,
[06:07.920 --> 06:13.280]  and there's a table, and this is like, even if you don't know anything about ODF, you
[06:13.280 --> 06:18.320]  will find another file from HTML markdown, and you have a certain assumption that if
[06:18.320 --> 06:24.320]  there's a table, you can insert a column, and this insert column function, yes, this
[06:24.320 --> 06:31.520]  change API request, that has a certain pattern of XML change, and this might and should be
[06:31.520 --> 06:36.320]  defined in the spec, generate even this API from it, right, so in the end it's something
[06:36.320 --> 06:40.320]  like this, we have a semantic layer, and this is currently not generatable, and XML layer
[06:40.320 --> 06:46.800]  and a package layer, and the idea is that you might exchange the semantic layer with
[06:46.800 --> 06:52.960]  even other file formats, like there's also a table where you can do markdown from a table
[06:52.960 --> 06:55.040]  insert column and markdown this way.
[06:55.040 --> 06:59.920]  So let me run through it a bit, of course, there's just a model and not a view, this
[06:59.920 --> 07:05.200]  is for Libre Vasone, and because as well that the spec is not very strict on the view, and
[07:05.200 --> 07:10.680]  the highlights is, we've done recently a release vote of one or two still, we've refactored
[07:10.680 --> 07:16.040]  a lot this code generation, and also did a release after 20 years and took over the
[07:16.040 --> 07:20.320]  multi schema value data, which is for loading and understanding the grammar, because we
[07:20.320 --> 07:25.200]  have something called real X and G, which is simpler like XSD, grammar, and from this
[07:25.200 --> 07:28.560]  we traverse and are able to generate as much.
[07:28.560 --> 07:35.600]  As in one, three upcoming release, nowish, I thought I could release it with Michael
[07:35.600 --> 07:41.560]  for Foster, but it was some bugs, and one at four later, why one at four later, that's
[07:41.560 --> 07:48.000]  the ODFTC update, really, you see, this was the last release, one or two with Son, that
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.200]  was really, Son was stopping staff this year, and it took a while till we made the next
[07:54.200 --> 07:55.520]  release for OASIS.
[07:55.520 --> 08:00.880]  And now we are closing on ODF, there's a link, you can click on it and see the query
[08:00.880 --> 08:08.200]  of the 66 issues, which are already in, and then 23 credit dates, where people can validate
[08:08.200 --> 08:10.480]  from, take something from it.
[08:10.480 --> 08:17.800]  Okay, so there's another thing, I did a project on a major data search engine, where the text
[08:17.800 --> 08:24.240]  in major been extracted from ODF, and I realized that there's something missing in ODF, I just
[08:24.240 --> 08:29.000]  for discussion after something, it's like, we don't have this ODF model in the middle,
[08:29.000 --> 08:35.480]  like this feature model, and then we say, okay, now I tell you, how do I do the export,
[08:35.480 --> 08:40.880]  how should a table look like in Markdown, and you can do cherry picking of features
[08:40.880 --> 08:47.520]  you like to have in your own format, like Markdown or HTML, and I realized that the
[08:47.520 --> 08:52.240]  whole design, we came from XML, and later we realized, we need this feature level to
[08:52.240 --> 08:57.560]  abstract from this thing to XML details, that this is missing.
[08:57.560 --> 09:03.640]  So here's some sources left, and I really, really love to discuss on some kind of this
[09:03.640 --> 09:22.800]  later by TB or something, thanks a lot, see you next year.
