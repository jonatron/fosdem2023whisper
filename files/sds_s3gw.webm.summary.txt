Jo√£o from SUSE Storage team presented a new project called S3 Gateway at the FOSDEM conference. Their aim is to provide an S3 service for local storage within a Kubernetes cluster that is easy to deploy and use. They leveraged the Rados Gateway from Ceph to create a new backend that stores data on a file-based backend instead of the Rados store. The S3 Gateway is currently under development and is not yet considered production-ready, but there are gradual performance improvements being made. The team hopes to increase the number of operations supported, ensure semantic compliance with the S3 API, and improve performance in the long run.
