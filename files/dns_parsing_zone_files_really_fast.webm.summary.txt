The talk given at FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about fast parsing of DNS zone files, which is currently slow in NSD. The slow parsing is due to the parser being based on lexing yak which is not suitable for zone files that are not standardized. The speaker presented algorithms that he used to identify quoted sections and classify blocks into non-quoted strings, improve identification of domain names, and use perfect hash to classify record types. The new implementation was able to achieve a scanning of 2 GB/s for zone files. The speaker also mentioned the plan to incorporate all the projects that use SIMD for base64 decoding and release it as a standalone library for anyone to use. The parser was able to strip comments and output the DNS wire format. There were also discussions on the benefits of fast parsing for zone files and the possibility of multi-threading in the parser.
