{"text": " Welcome to this session. We are talking today about open source collaboration tools for Al fresco, how to improve the online editing experience by using the Al fresco as document repository and some other known open source services for the collaborative editing online. My name is Angel Boroy, I'm a developer evangelist in Highland that is the company that is producing Al fresco today and I hope you enjoy this session. Let's move with the agenda for today. On the first part, we are going to review what Al fresco does, so the main features are Al fresco as CSP and we are going also over this topic later. The second part will be focused on the default applications provided by Al fresco in the integration API, so you can understand what the integrations we are going to explore later are adding to the product. After that, we are going to focus on the online editing collaboration tools that we are testing today, mainly LibreOffice, Collaboration Online and OnlyOffice. We are going to see some live demos on how to integrate this with Al fresco and how to use that with the Al fresco applications. And finally, some recap, some thoughts about the future and about these integrations we are going to explore. So let's move to the first topic, Al fresco as CSP, so the content service platform is a term that was coined by Garner back in 2014 and mainly what that means is that there is a set of services, APIs and repositories that are working with content types, that are working with documents and that are helping to classify and to manage all these documents. On the last year, this topic was named as ECM, Enterprise Content Management, but in these days, this term, this content service platform is the most used in order to classify this kind of platforms like Al fresco. Remember also that Al fresco is an open source product, the main license is LGPO version 3, so you may copy, distribute and modify this software and you need to provide also source code if you are extending the Al fresco, as it happens in the modules in the add-ons we are going to see later. We are open to the community, so you have all this source code that I labeled in the Al fresco GitHub.com, we have also a Maven repository because mainly this is developed with Java, so you have also this open Maven repository, you can get in touch with the community in the Al fresco hub, hub.alfresco.com and there is also the official documentation available that you can also contribute to improve that and we have also some chatting channels like the Al fresco Discord channel, so we are open to you, just reach us if you have some thought of if you want just to improve the experience with the Al fresco open source product. So let's start reviewing what are the features provided by Al fresco and by mainly all the other content service platforms, so this is like a classical flow of document management inside a content service platform, so you start with the ingestion of the document, so you need to put the documents on the repository and in this step you can apply some OCR transformation and classification operations and once we have the document inside the repository then we need to classify that by using content models describing the properties, the metadata associated to a document, we are providing also the searching by using this metadata and its properties, these values and also the content of the documents, we can also transform the documents just changing the mind type or for some enrichment of the metadata or the content and we can also provide some automations and workflow for the rules in order to work with the document to transform the document or to move the document between different users and finally it's the collaboration, it's the review, the co-authoring, the online editing and some process that happens between the users on the same document and for that we have like a simple integration with Office and Google Docs that we are going to see later, so let's move on the ingestion process, so the ingestion process mainly is just getting a document that can be rotated, that can be grained and we can apply some processes like OCR transformation in order to get something more clear in order to get the test of the document and the right quality, so we can classify the document, in this case we are extracting the metadata, the type of the contract, the name, the taker, provider address, some metadata and also the content of the document and with that we have the document inside the alfresco repository, if we move to the content model, so the content model is something that is used in order to describe every document in order to classify the document with different metadata, so in this case we are using a type that can be a list of a screen, the name of the document, taker that is the name of the taker and provider also can be a list of different streams, we can apply regular expression in order to validate the input, the postal code and the content and with that, without definition, we are providing UI form for the users in order to change the properties, the values of the properties or in order to verify that is extracted in the right way, we can upload the document also manually and something that we are also providing is the versioning for the content for the metadata, so you can understand the different changes that are happening on our document, if we move to the searching part in alfresco we are providing three different search syntaxes, so the first one should be like free, so you can use a term in order to get the information from metadata and content, you can use FTS, FTS is the alfresco syntax, so you can just combine your terms with some properties, with the value of some properties, so in this case like the type contract and finally we have the standard CMIS that is something related with SQL, it's like the SQL syntax and also allows you to create some filters and some conditions on your documents, so with that we are providing facets and we are providing also the results from your searching type and you can just connect with your documents, for this process we are also applying permissions, so every user, every document is associated to user groups, to some authorities, so we are applying also that to your searching capabilities, another service provided is the transform service, so for this transform service we can create some renditions, for instance a thumbnail of one document or we can start some pages, we can also apply nlp to extract or to recognize some information that is on the document and finally we can apply also some transformations to the main type, so finally you got like different versions of the input of the initial document, and we move to the automation, we have for instance these folder rules that are able to classify the document according to different criteria, so for instance for every document of type contract you have to start the approval workflow and the approval workflow is something that also is provided by the by the alfresco repository and that is related in the activity engine, that is a vpmn engine, so we can define our workflow for the document and with different steps that are prepared for user interaction or for automating some process and connection with external services and so on, so these are like the first steps for a document and once the document is prepared, once we have this document with all the metadata, with the content, with the searching capabilities then we need to start working with that in many cases, so by default alfresco is providing the circuit protocol that can be used with office in order to edit these office documents, we have also support for google docs, so we can copy the document to google docs, you can edit the document in google docs and that is coming again back to the alfresco repository but we have something in the middle that is not covered, that is the online editing the collaboration with an online open source platform and this is what we are going to see today, this is what we are going to explore in this session but let's start with the integration mechanisms and the applications that are provided by alfresco default out of the box, let's start with that, if we talk about alfresco applications and integration APIs, yes for you to understand how to integrate a solution with alfresco, we can think of the main user applications that these days are two of them, we have one that is named SER, this web application is like the legacy web application that provides the access to the documents and all the collaboration features and that is it's built on top of freemaker, dojo toolkit and ui, so they are like all the technologies and the development happens in java, so we are creating java projects in order to extend this application, on the other hand we have also the adf the alfresco development framework that it's built on top of angular, so you have some angular components and you can add your angular components to this ui application, so there are different applications with different SDKs with different ways of extending, currently many users are still using SER but the new users are using adf ACA that is the alfresco content application, it's one implementation of this adf, so if you are planning to create something new for the alfresco ecosystem then you need to move to the angular one, and if you are supporting still previous deployments of alfresco probably you want to create something for SER, for the alfresco SER we are talking about alfresco SER add-ons, so you have on the alfresco documentation all the instructions in order to create this kind of extension for this application that can be declarative, just configuring something of the application, changing some behaviors and default behaviors of the application, you can create something that is programmatic, so you can add new features, add new functionality to the application, and you can even overwrite default behaviors of the application, so this is very rich and it's really relying on these maven projects, so it's a java project, you add all your modifications and you deploy that on the SER web application, if we move to the alfresco ui extension to the adf then this is something different, then you need to use an angular project and you can overwrite or disable extension points, you can change some rules, actions, visual elements, you can register new application routes, and you can also reduce new rules about auto components, so you have all the information also on the alfresco official documentation and the extensibility, these extending mechanisms, it's able to apply your angular components to the default application, so you are working in this case with angular, so you need a detailed knowledge of angular in order to extend that, if we move to the integration api, so remember that we were talking about SER and adf that are mainly the uis, are mainly the user applications that we are providing, but even with that you have also some extension mechanisms on the repository, so you have the res api and the even apis that we are we are compiling both into the alfresco javasdk that the name is out of process, because this integration happened out of the alfresco repository, so you can use both res api and the events api that is related on active enqueue from this SDK, if you want to create an extension inside the repository then we have the in-process SDK, so with this SDK you can create some new resume points or you can create some behavior different inside the alfresco repository, and finally we are supporting also the standard cmi client that should be more or less also some out of process extension, so let's go deeper with the first one, so this out of process is reliant on events and res apis, again in the official documentation you have everything you need in order to use this api and this is based on cloud events, specification and open spi specification, so both events and the res api are specified on standards that you can rely on, and you have all the different actions and all the different information in relation with action activities, comments, notes and so on, so you are able to interact with all the different entities of the repository by using events or using the res api, if we move to the in-process, to the maven SDK that is related in java, you can just create a new content model, you can add some new res api endpoints, you can also create some behaviors for some policies in the repository, so you can just create new behaviors for that and add new code to the standard alfresco lifecycle for the nodes, you can create some transformations and extract some metadata, and even you can create some schedule jobs, so you have a wide variety of operations that you can extend on the alfresco repository by using this kind of integration, if we move to the cmis that is a standard developed by oasis, so you have all the specifications at this point, alfresco is supporting like 90% of the standards, so we have a wide coverage of the standard, and in this case we are working with res api bandis that can be in xml or in json, so browser atompook, and we have also some kind of services and navigation, object, multi-filing, discovery, versioning, relationship, so we are able also to interact with the repository by using this cmis standard that have clients for many different technologies, so java obviously and python, and many different technologies that you can use, so these are mainly the all the different ways of extending alfresco, so remember the applications and this UI applications, these user applications, but then we can also move to the repository and we can also extend the repository features by using one of the SDKs, so let's move to the next section. Okay, let's start with the online editing collaboration tools, that this is like the main topic of this session, and we are going to start with LibreOffice, so the first integration with LibreOffice was relying on web app or cmis protocol, so we can see this sample from our partner, from our community developer, repillibro, that was just checking out the document, editing the document, checking in the document again, so it was a process that was not that easy, right, so you have this description, you have this process description also for reference, but we are going to explore something like, it's like more simple than that, that is the colabora online project, so colabora online is a project that is providing LibreOffice for the online editing, so you have this project that is hosted by colabora online itself, that is the alfresco colabora online, it's an avant-garde alfresco that we are going to see later, and is maintained by Yesi, Yesi is a French company very focused in open source, but the nice thing about that is that this project is coming from Magenta, that was a Danish company, and this Danish company created some initial version, then this developer, Jeremy Lesard from Yesi, created something better, Arawa came later to create something better, and finally all this previous work was consolidated in the alfresco colabora online that is currently the version we are using, so this add-on that you have available on the colabora online, you have a com, provides online editing for alfresco using colabora online, so many users can open the same document at the same time, and they can collaborate together on the same document, this integration is made by using new opi, this web application open platform interface protocol, so that means that we are open an iframe inside alfresco, and it's really very handy because you have your iframe and you can just work with that without being out of alfresco, so very clean implementation from that, and it's providing an add-on for alfresco ser for the legacy application, it's also providing an extension of the UI for ACA for ADF, an angular extension, an angular component, and it's providing also the alfresco repository add-on, this alfresco repository add-on is required and you can deploy the ser add-on or the UI extension if you are using ser or if you are using ADF ACA application, an angular application, but the repository is required because it's providing some services that are used by both UI applications, in order to test this project we have created, we have created a repository that includes a Docker Compose template that you can use to test the integration, so this is just something that you can use to test the integration, but if you want to deploy that in production or you want to move farther with the integration, then probably you need to contact with GSE or you need to you need to spend some time in order to understand better how that works, so this Docker Compose yes needs some modifications for you, the first one is that you need to use to add your public URLs for collaboration alfresco, so in this alfresco setting I'm using this one that is my local IP, but you need to add yours and then we are using the collaboration online development editing, so we are using this code with no SSL and we are exposing that by using the port 9980, so these are like the main characteristics of the Docker Compose, just remember to add your own IP and we are also just extending the alfresco Docker images in order to deploy the collaborative platform extension for the repository and in order also to deploy the collaborate extension for the SER application, we are not providing the collaborate extension, so we are not providing the ADF extension, the Angular component, because we want to compare this integration, this collaborate integration with only office, since only office don't have ADF extension, we are only using this, but you can also deploy this collaborate extension, if you are using ADF or ACA, there is no problem in doing that, just follow the instructions on the main web page on the GitHub project and you can understand how to apply that, and with no more explanations, let's dive into the demo. Before starting with the demo, just remember that you have in the collaborate online GitHub account, you have this alfresco collaborate online, that is the project we are going to use, that is the one providing the ad-ons for the repository, this platform extension for the SER application, this one we are not going to use the collaborate extension, the Angular extension, but you can also use that, you have all the instructions below, just for you to understand how to build and deploy that, and we are going to use this alfresco collaboration tools project, that includes the Docker compose template for both collaborate and only office, so for the collaborate one, we have this Docker compose with some alfresco and SER Docker image extensions, so just remember to check your IP, so in my case, my IP is this one, my public IP is this one, so this is the one I need to use, okay, just change that in the Docker compose, and without any additional instructions, we can just start the Docker compose, so let's start that, I just have the project locally, so Docker compose up, we are going to build the Docker images, so the Docker images are very easy, so we have this the extension at this point, and we are just standing the alfresco repository and copying the YAR to the deployment folder, and it's the same thing exactly for SER, so we have a extension, and we are copying this extension to the deployment folder, so once the deployment is ready, then we need to use this URL, or this URL in order to access the environment, so just let's wait for it to start, it looks like now it's ready, so we can just go and open a new fresco with SER, we are opening this SER web application that has this the collaborate online on it, this extension, we can just go and find some document like this one, and with that you can see this editing collaborate online action, that is something that was added by the add-on, if we click on that, then we have this, we have the news, so we have this iframe that is on the alfresco application, we can just add something, we can change something on that, we can just save the document, and when we close, then we have the new document with all the changes, and we have also that version, so let me create also some additional users, so we can experiment how that works with many different users editing the same document, I'll be back in a minute, okay so now we have two different users with access to the document, we have the test one in this browser, and we have the test two in this other browser, so if we start editing the document with test one, we can go back to this other user, and we can see that cool entry is being edited with collaborate online, but we still can be editing the document also, so with that we have collaborative editing with test one, with test two, we can make some changes, for instance I'm going to change that with the user with text two, and we can save that, if we move to the other one, the change is happening, it is live, and we can change also from this other user this color, and we can again save that, so once we are back to the document, we can see that if we close also this edition, and we refresh the environment, it's not being edited anymore, all the changes are happening on the document, and on the version history we have the change happened by test two and test one, so very clean, it works as expected, and is very useful to apply this kind of collaboration of editing collaboration with collaborate online, so it worked, let's move to the next one, if we move to the only office integration, then we have another case of collaboration, so the initial integration was created by Cetric3, that user was working for Parasift, so they created the initial version, and then this was adopted by OnlyOffice itself on the GitHub account of OnlyOffice in order to promote and to improve this integration, so you have the project in the official GitHub account of OnlyOffice, it provides online editing, also and many users can be editing at the same time, so it's more or less the same thing as collaborative, but in this case they are using a custom protocol that is not WOPI, and it updates the document after 10 seconds of inactivity in OnlyOffice, so you can also just see on that, but it's a custom protocol created specifically for this operation, you can also get access to the details on the GitHub account, and also the difference is that we are not using an iFrame anymore, but we are opening OnlyOffice in a new browser, with a new browser tab, so we are editing the document on this tab, and then we are going back to Alfresco, we are, this add-on is providing an Alfresco share add-on and an Alfresco repository add-on, so there is no option for ADF or ACA for the Angular components in this case, but you can still develop that because it's more or less the same thing as we have with the Collabora app. The deployment provided, again on the Alfresco collaboration tools project with the OnlyOffice folder, is just using the OnlyOffice document server, but with the JWT option enabled, because we are using the latest version of the document server, so we need to enable this authentication, so we are using this secret, and we are signing this secret in the document server, in the OnlyOffice document server, and we are also applying that to the Alfresco repository, so we are deploying the JWT application in the Alfresco repository, and we are adding this for the Alfresco global property, so the OnlyOffice URL, remember that this should be also the PolyURL, and the secret that we are signing with the document server with the OnlyOffice, and we are deploying the OnlyOffice integration in the server application, and no extension is available for the Alfresco container, so extending the Docker images, just to add these settings, the Office, the OnlyOffice URL, and the JWT secret, and creating this JWT secret on the configuration for the Docker Compose, so with that in mind, let's start with the demo. For OnlyOffice, again we have the OnlyOffice project in the official OnlyOffice JWT with your instructions, and you have also the releases ready to be deployed on that, so you have both add-ons enabled, and we have created this OnlyOffice project that again has the Docker Compose, the Docker Compose templates for reference, remember again to use your own public IP for that, just change this parameter, and then you can just go with that, so we have also the project again, so we can start this on the OnlyOffice folder, and the extension in this case is more or less the same thing, so we have this Docker file, and we are copying the add-on, the JAR file to the deployment folder, since this is not supporting environment variables, this add-on, we are copying the configuration we want also as the Alfresco global property, so it's a small difference with the other, with the JWT secret, and also with the public URL, and insert is more or less the same, so we are extending the Alfresco Docker image and copying the JAR to the deployment folder, so again more or less the same approach, a simple Docker Compose with some extension for the Alfresco Docker images in order to apply that, so we can just go with that, we can open again SER, we are going to use the admin user for the first test, let's see if that is working, so in this case something that is also interesting is that if we navigate to the same document, we were modifying before, so this one, we have now the written OnlyOffice or convert using OnlyOffice, so this is because OnlyOffice is not supporting this format, so we can convert the document, and once the document is converted, we have this one that is ready to be edited in OnlyOffice, so with that again, this is OnlyOffice window, we can just change that, and once we close these windows, when we say okay this is safe, after some time, we are going to get the modification in Alfresco, so you can say that the system still thinks that the document is being edited, but if we wait a bit more, then we have the version 2.0 and we have the modification on it, so it's also something that we can use very easily, we just need to wait a bit to get the changes in the Alfresco repository, and let's see now how that works when different users are editing the same document, and let me create some configuration and let's move to that. Okay, so we have a similar setting, so we have the user test 1 in this browser, we have the user test 2 in this other browser, and just let's check what's happening when I click on editing OnlyOffice, so I'm editing in OnlyOffice with the first user, if I move to this one and I refresh, I can see like the document is located, so I cannot co-edit on that, so I need yes some cooperation in order to collaborate with it, so I can close this one and wait a bit, since that is not edited anymore, and the same thing on the other side, and we can just click on editing OnlyOffice and editing OnlyOffice again, so now we are both editing the same document at the same time, so we have two users and two users, if I change this one from user 2, okay, and I close, that will be safe, and if I change this order from user 1, so yes, let's move to green again, and I close again, then probably, or I expect to find the document is still locked by the other user, so let's wait a bit, remember that there is some time you need to wait, okay, now everything, all the changes are on the document, and I have also this change, so only the latest changes, the latest change was updated to Al fresco, so we don't have the full history, but we were able to edit the document both at the same time by using OnlyOffice, right, so the behavior is a bit different, but it's still working and is still able to provide collaboration between both, okay, that was also awesome, and let's move with some more material for today, okay, once we learn about Al fresco, what Al fresco is providing, and we'll learn also about all the different APIs and applications that Al fresco is providing, we review two different approaches for the online editing collaboration, one coming from Collaboration Online, that is relying on LibreOffice, and the other coming from OnlyOffice, so both integrations are providing a source for their repository for the set application, and also the Collaboration Online is providing an Angular component for the new UI for the ADF ACA Al fresco UI application, so with that, just remember that Al fresco is providing some content service platform features that can be useful for you in order to prepare the documents for this online collaboration, however, in Al fresco we are adding this collaborative editing feature by using standard services, we are talking about the community edition, the open source edition, that you have the source code and so on, so for this edition you need to add collaborative editing by using, for instance, OnlyOffice or Collaboration Online, and as I said, you can use Share for both, and you can use ADF also for Collaboration Online. Thanks to every contributor that made this reel, so as we saw before, this was like a journey in order to create the Collaboration Online add-on for Al fresco, and also a shorter journey for the OnlyOffice add-on, but it was a history of collaboration, and this is something that really makes that happens and made that valuable, and if you are planning to integrate your service with Al fresco, yes, contact me, reach me, yes, talk me in the conference, or just reach me by any of my social media, because really we like you to use our product, and we like to create this collaboration histories, so I hope that was a useful session for you, and you have my email, and you have me also in the social media, so just always willing to help and willing to collaborate with you in some ideas or some projects you have. It was a pleasure for my side, see you there, and bye. Yeah, so I think that we have about four minutes for questions. I don't know, Angel, if the connection is stable enough on your end, or if you can hear me, so I have to mention for the audience that Angel today is at FOSDEM, so you may be able to see him also within the corridors. I guess so, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, great. So let me try to fetch the questions. Yeah, so can you hear me, come in? Oh, it's a bit delayed, but I guess that we can try. Yeah, indeed. So actually, well, don't hesitate, for anyone in the chat, don't hesitate to ask questions. On my end, I had one when it comes to the only office integration, actually two of them. So you mentioned that you are opening the only office editor now in a new tab instead of an iframe for the collaborator editor. Is it like a restriction that you found with only office, or is it more for answering a security concern, or do you know about it? No, not really. I guess that was a restriction, because this alone was started some years ago, and they created like a new pattern of integration, this distance seconds waiting time. Probably, if doing that on the current days, let's collaborate online. But the nice thing is that you have the source code, you have the APIs, now you have all the basic tools in order to make that real. And also, again, if you're planning to do that, just try and reach me, and we'll try to build something together. So this was like the main methods of this session. So there are people working with that, there are people just creating some ideas, and we can contribute to make that better. But I guess that the only office integration can be recreated using the modern features of the only office platform. Okay, okay, great. And so we have about one minute left, I think, for the talk. Maybe one last question. So by recreating this only office filter using the new APIs that you provide as part of Al fresco, do you plan to have a multi user collaboration here in your demo? For example, you showed that you had to have one user that opens the only office document, and then the other one, and then closes it, and then the other one can open it, but they cannot really edit in real time. Is it something that you are planning to build also? Or it needs to be in the wrong map, I would say. Yeah, yeah. So the behavior can be exactly the same you have with the collaboration online. So both both users collaborating online and creating changes. But I'm presenting this from the perspective of of Al fresco. So we are not maintaining the project, right? Okay, yeah, and help to make that real. Okay, yeah, that's good. Okay, thanks a lot, Angel. And so if there are other questions, then you can the the the room called tackling the document, sorry, the room tackling named open source collaboration tools for Al fresco should be no open. And so if you have more questions, maybe they can be put there. So on your end, thanks a lot for for joining the event yet again this year.
