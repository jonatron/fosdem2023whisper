In this talk, Samuel discusses PyDantic 2, a data validation library in Python that leverages REST superpowers. He provides an introduction to PyDantic, talks about its popularity and usage, and explains the need for rebuilding PyDantic completely. By using Rust, Samuel explains how PyDantic can be faster, have strict mode, functional validators, composability, and better maintainability. He envisions a future where Python acts as the user interface for Rust, and explains the advantages of Rust in deeply recursive code, small modular components, and complex error handling. He also touches on the idea of using Rust to build low-level components and Python for high-level application logic. Samuel concludes the talk by discussing plans for PyDantic and the possibility of implementing alternative schema types such as protobuf or Avro.
