The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 discussed NASA's use of open source software and its commitment to open science. The speaker highlighted the importance of software in all NASA missions and shared success stories of open source software projects, such as the Ingenuity drone copter and the James Webb Space Telescope. The challenges faced by NASA in terms of licensing, bureaucracy, and software sustainability were also discussed. The speaker then outlined the opportunities for NASA in the open source and open science communities, including the release of data and software, new policies, funding initiatives, and community engagement. The audience was encouraged to contribute to NASA's open source projects and join in the mission to explore the universe and reveal the unknown.
