{"text": " Hi, everyone. I hope you're doing well and not feeling enough sleepy after the lunch hours. We are here to talk about introduction to Sef on Kubernetes using Rook. Here's Alexander. Alexander will introduce himself. I'm Gaurav, Cloud Storage Engineer at Coore Technologies and I'm also a community ambassador for the Sef project from Indian region and been working with the Sef and Rook project since a long time and now contributor to the Rook project. I'm Alexander Trost, funding engineer of Coore Technology Sync. I'm a maintainer of the Rook project as well and yeah we wanted to talk about Rook for everyone who doesn't know it. I want to get you started with storage who doesn't need fast reliable storage nowadays with the cloud native applications. We're obviously talking about a bit more well more performant storage I guess depending on who you're asking. Well the point of Rook in end is that with Kubernetes being kind of like with the shipping container ship here you have your Kubernetes that kind of abstracts everything tries to well provide you this one API for most to all things depending on how far you want to go with it and I guess for most people running Kubernetes it kind of looks like that if you have your big giant ship running your production applications and you have your automation and CI CD process that kind of just try to keep it running and that's where the question with storage more and more comes into frame for people especially with local storage already like I think a year or so a year or two even ago coming into let's say being better supported in Kubernetes in a native way and not just having things around Kubernetes to try to make that an easier endeavor. We have the question of how can I for example get my self storage talking with Kubernetes so that I have storage for my applications and well that's the simple interface it's more or less great that it's nowadays mainly one interface there called CSI container storage interface which for well for storage vendors basically means they only need to implement one storage they only need to implement one interface and as well for Kubernetes slash you as a user you have one interface or like one way on how you can get storage for example if you want storage on Kubernetes you have the way of using the persistent volume claims we basically from our application perspective claim storage and Kubernetes will take care of for example talking with self storage and provisioning the volume and subsequently the CSI driver from Seth will take care of the whole mapping the volume mounting the volume so that is completely transparent to your application and the whole thing is with the CSI interface there it's like this one way for any storage vendor to also get their storage running like there's well there's obviously more than Seth but well obviously with Rook Seth we're going to focus on Seth here and that's exactly kind of like a connector that in between there so if you want storage doesn't really matter if it's just Seth the point over obviously Seth is that we have the Seth CSI that's disconnecting bits from Kubernetes from the applications container side for your storage and that's already a point where kind of Rook we're starting to talk about Rook here is that you can run your Seth's storage cluster well on most to any hardware I don't know what we could run it on a Raspberry Pi as well all right yes easily um you can well I think I've heard people run it on some Android phones or something even as well but it's like the well you know just because you can doesn't necessarily mean you should but that's a whole nother discussion the point being you can technically have yourself storage anywhere so it doesn't really matter if it's well if it's on the metal in your own data center or if it's just a few laptops thrown together doesn't that's the thing with Seth in general there it's like you don't need the best hardware like you don't need to buy that big box from the one storage hardware vendor maybe to explicitly go into that direction to have storage and that's the thing where kind of the combination of using Kubernetes and Seth might come into play or just for having storage for your applications but also as a point for how should I put it for running Seth that's what Rook is about it's about running Seth obviously the connecting part setting that con connection up between Seth and Kubernetes as well but the idea is that Rook runs Seth in Kubernetes in containers kind of I think I think I mainly saw it from Seth ADM last time we deployed it cluster on bare metal directly that like Seth ADM also one other way maybe to put like that to do install deploy even configure easily manage it's easily managed but it's one way to just install run it it's kind of the same point of for like Rook where Rook is basically a Seth operator for Kubernetes I'm going to go into a little bit more what an operator does because that's like that's one of the vital points in general just from well running certain applications on Kubernetes and just again as we had it like running Seth on Kubernetes we can with the operator pattern that we have in Kubernetes we can easily have most things that cause quite some pain depending on how big you scale your storage cluster as well obviously deployment bootstrap and configuration upgrades and everything like that's all processes that I think there's probably five million ansible playboots to install Seth there's well obviously Seth ADM there's what was called the deploy was there early as well which is Seth ADM I think now it is right Seth deploy is earlier Seth ADM is now more of a no advanced and I mean latest tool that everyone is using these days and there's more like I can already just think about five more tools on like how to deploy Seth and ironically for the people that have looked into Kubernetes a bit more already it's kind of the same story for deploying Kubernetes but because of Kubernetes being kind of like this abstraction layer on top of hardware to some degree abstracting everything away but very quick skip this is that patch it allows the Rook operator that's exactly where this image comes in it's orchestrating a cluster it's not just a well deployment office here as well but it's about using the Kubernetes APIs to easily just take care of everything so to say you want add a new a new note into your storage cluster what do you do technically speaking you just add it to Kubernetes and well if everything goes well ten seconds later the operator will be like oh new note gotta do my job run the preparing job and everything get the note ready and a few seconds even later from that the new self components the OSDs on the disk depending what disks are obviously as well are taken care from that's kind of to make this full circle there with Kubernetes side is like what the operator flow kind of pattern it's mostly called is about it's about observing the operator is observing a status or even in Kubernetes case custom resources these are just think about it as like YAML let's just give it a dead what it is an object of YAML in Kubernetes which the operator can well watch on I as a user either make a change or even like my automatic CI CD process makes a change to it like oh a new note has been added or something or I want to tweak something in the configuration of the cluster and so the operator is observing that and when there's a change or when there's even in like the Kubernetes cluster there's a change like a node missing or something it analyzes that change for example if a node is gone or is just not ready in Kubernetes terms anymore let's say network outage for like two of your nodes the operator would analyze well observe it first of all analyze that and start acting upon that for example in Kubernetes terms it would take care of setting certain so-called just to have that term out there portrait disruption budgets which kind of tried to prevent other nodes from potentially stopping the components of the SAF storage cluster main point is really just that it's this like observe analyze act kind of loop because in the end it just repeats itself all over again it's a whole deal with Kubernetes operators it's it's again if like I want to for I guess the people more already into the SAF if you want to scale up some more SAF monitors or well soft months you just edit the object in Kubernetes in the API and just crank the number from one count from three to five or something and again this changes detected by the operator analyzes it and acts upon it and that makes it quite convenient as well again here over perfect with the YAML sorry it's a I've just this guy and come a little bit of clarification I don't have it mirrored on my screen so it's a bit hard but that's exactly the YAML that we talked about like as an example I have my cluster running and let's say new SAF release for what I would need to do to upgrade my cluster I would basically go ahead and just change the image to be well not 1723 let's say as an example yeah 1725 as an example and again operator would detect that analyze if every component is up to date or not and then even start well I don't want to say complicated upgrade process but there's especially with something a SAF there's more than just I'll let me just restart it there's checks before every component is restarted through SAF native ways of like it's basically commands that are well okay to stop they're basically called like that and that's the whole idea there that the operator helps you with that and in the end just fully takes care of it so that in the end for the main part of your work you can just sit back change it in the YAML in a few minutes or it can't even be ours depending on how big the cluster is the operator will take care of that as I mentioned before like the example of the monitor count for example we want to change that change it a few seconds later the operator will pick that up and start making the changes necessary or even if you would want to scale it down from like 5 to 3 or 3 to 1 which not recommended we need highly availability there or another option the operator again what does it takes care of doing it or even if you want to specifically say on this one note please use this one device or even for this then disk or NVMe for example use more than one storage team OSD team for that these things are possible and quite easily just by writing some lines of YAML in the end according to your workload you can easily just customize your according to your workload you can easily customize your YAMLs that will make your life easier and we've mainly talked about having like the cluster running or even setting up the cluster with the YAML definition of a self cluster object but if you would for example want to well run some Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster and need storage for them to be able to use storage in SAF you need to have a storage pool for example RBD storage block storage basically we also again just go ahead create a SAF block pool object which is simply containing the information of if we go from here failure domain where well you basically tell SAF to only store data on different hosts to keep it simple for now the replicated size that there will be a free total replica of three copies of data in your cluster that requires SAF replicas let's just skip the phone out it's like a SAF replica size and even that you could technically set the compression mode for this pool point is again we can just write this in YAML apply it against the Kubernetes API and a few seconds later also for like the other objects same way you need the SAF file system SAF object storage same way the operator takes care of creating all the components for example the MDS for a file system we have the well standard components like the manager the monitors operator the OSD's and even for the object store for example the RJW components and the operator simply takes care of that and again if you change the SAF version a few seconds to maybe a minute or two later depending on what the state of your clusters operator will take care of doing the update we've talked about we've talked about we've talked about deploying root SAF cluster mainly right now we want to highlight in that in that point as well the crew plug-in that root SAF is building and yeah providing it allows you to well have certain processes automated even certain disaster recovery cases are easier to handle with that and GERF will talk a bit about that so so what's crew right crew is basically a package manager for kubectl plugins you can I mean it makes the management of Kubernetes easier and that's how the core developers and maintainers came together and thought we can definitely write a plug-in to make the life of our developers and administrators more easier crew was the way to go since it's the de facto package manager for kubectl plugins so I mean you can just do a crew kubectl install kubectl crew install root SAF that's how the plug-in will be installed and just if you can see we just ran the help command it shows a bunch of things that you could do you can just run a whole bunch of SAF commands RBD commands right now also check the health of your cluster you could just do a bunch of things like even if you want to remove an OSD so the need actually arise because for example if you want to use underlying tools like SAF object store or something like that to debug core troubleshooting issues and core issues at core OSD level I mean crew plugin is definitely a great way to go as it provides common management and troubleshooting tools for SAF it's currently I mean a lot of things work will show you it's just like I mentioned you just need to run kubectl crew install root SAF it goes ahead quickly installs the plugin it's I mean way easier that you just don't need to earlier I mean you need had to go inside the toolbox pod to debug and troubleshoot every issue with crew it provides such an ease of access that it makes I mean lives easier and troubleshooting makes is definitely easier you could just override the cluster configuration just at the runtime and some of the disaster recovery scenarios are also addressed some of the troubleshooting scenarios that were addressed is mon recovery suppose let's say you will have the default three mons in the cluster and majority of them lose code I mean recovering mons from mon maps I mean just doing bunch of tasks could be if not done carefully it could be it could lead to more disasters but certainly with more automation in place when things are definitely working this is also made easier with the crew plugin and even if you want to troubleshoot CSI issues it's it it makes it easier for sure so yeah I mean just like if you want to restore mons with OSDs and even if we just delete a custom delete the root SAF cluster after accidental deletion of custom resources that could be also restored and one of the common goals in the road map is also automating core dump collection because let's say if there's an issue that happens with the SAF demon and we want to collect the core dump of the process for further investigation to share it with the developers and with the community to understand what issues we are facing it can easily do well if you want to just do a performance profiling of a process with gdb that could be made easier as well so that these are some of the goals the current the current plug is in plug-in is written in bash but there's a work going on to rewrite the whole plug-in in Golang so that it's definitely more scalable and much more easier to manage and even for contributors so yeah just like that so I guess the point we're more or less just trying to make is that if you have Kubernetes or even run a distribution of well what is the Ranger open shift obviously as well on your hardware and I would even put it to some degree as like a you're confident enough with Kubernetes to run it you can have it quite easy running a SAF cluster as well on top of that obviously to some degree you need some SAF knowledge but that's with everything if you run it in if you want to run it in production it's just that with this abstraction layer again with Kubernetes it makes it easier for you it's more of like you kind of start in general there to think of more of like well I have some notes and they're simply well there to take care of the components that you need to run for the SAF cluster and especially with the root SAF operator obviously it makes the process easier by well a GitOps approach for example where you can just throw your YAMLs into well into Git most of the time and have that automatic mechanism basically to care of this deployment process so that again the operator just takes the YAML takes care of it and makes the changes necessary and with the RUG SAF crew plugin just so you get that summarized real quick again it's a way for yeah for us to have certain automatic processes in the hand of admins when they need to and not just as like a hey here's like a 100 line bash clip please run that one command at a time and it simply allows it again because we have this access to communities where we can just ask Kubernetes hey where's the monitor running oh it's on node A and all that because well we have an API that can tell us most of this information and also for recovery scenarios there we can just ask Kubernetes to run a new pod or to well have a new monitor for example then running with this old information from the other monitors to have this forum recovered that is required there and regarding RUG SAF is like a general outlook for the future some of the major points we're currently looking at is that we want to improve the cluster manageability even more than it we already have it at we'll make it easier we're using the RUG SAF plugin right now you still need to do quite a lot of manual YAML editing of the objects that we have in the in the in the API but we would like to have well some more crew plugin commands there again to extend that functionality make make it simply easier as well improved security by having the operator and other components that are running in the cluster use separate access credentials to the cluster just to have there a bit more well I guess to some degree even transparency if you would look at like audit logging of the SAF cluster and as well that's encryption support for SAFFS and OSDs on partitions and as with everything there's more feel free to check out the roadmap MD file on the GitHub GitHub.com slash RUG the link will be shown as well if you want to get involved if you want to contribute if you have questions or anything we have well obviously to GitHub there's even the GitHub discussions open if you have any well any more more questions I guess then that might not fit on Slack we well we have Twitter account obviously we also have community meetings if you have any more pressing concerns to talk about and well just kind of from that side as well where as Garth and I mentioned we're from code technology sync we're building a company that wants to create a product around RUG staff and just in general try to help the community out there if we do talk with us or contact us as well and for now thank you for listening and we'll gladly take some questions and can simply take the last I think you showed 50 minutes for questions or even just talking a bit about certain scenarios here with everyone I guess one more last thing before we go it's not a good idea that there's two like yeah I would just like to add one last thing if you want to check a demo and more troubleshooting scenarios we did a talk at self virtual summit 2022 it's already there on YouTube where we demoed couple troubleshooting scenarios and crew plugin I'll definitely share a reference and add a reference to here but that'll be a good to check out as well if you want to check it check out a live demo yeah thanks thanks any questions I was wondering a bit the downsides of using RUG with SAF because SAF is known to be really hard in configuring and getting the right performance to do some kind of granularity there. So if I've summarized correctly the question is what are like the downsides I would more or less maybe put it at the advantages disadvantages of using RUG to run SAF on Kubernetes especially with SAF being quite complex. If there's a loss of control on SAF side. Oh I see okay and attitude at if there's anything that's well you lose when you use RUG SAF. I guess as a major downside that most people see as well is because you have an additional layer with Kubernetes being that. I guess maybe to address that a bit more from what is at least I know there for example with SAF ADM I think SAF ADM is for RUG uses Docker to run containers basically as well right. So SAF ADM for example at least uses kind of also introduces in that layer so to say with Docker slash Potman well one that runs container insert here. It has more or less in regards to like installing SAF for example in my eyes but I'm like I'm very biased to containers obviously. It has this aspect of here's the SAF image and it should work unless you you know have something weird with the host OS going on. Downside is again like if Kubernetes just goes completely crazy the SAF class is probably also gonna have a bad time but that's kind of then like the weighing off do you are you confident enough I guess to well run Kubernetes and even running a Kubernetes cluster for long term it's like especially with Kubernetes there's more of this talk about was again Pets versus Cattle so instead of just you know having a cluster for every application or something even and just and oh we're done throwing it away versus for well obviously something that's persistent and important as a SAF cluster you can't just throw it away then. From experience so far I can tell that it is possible to run a Rook SAF cluster over multiple years I think I when did I start mine I think I had it running for two years and the only reason I shut it down was because I had gotten new hardware in another location I kind of just said I was like do I migrate it or do I not mine it was just okay let's just start from scratch but that's also because that's cluster I'm talking about there had like 50 other applications running where it's just like a okay let's start from scratch anyway so to say in regards to losing control it's not necessarily you don't really have like a like you don't have like a use this disk manual really way besides putting it in the yaml and fingers crossed the operator takes care of preparing and then deploying an OSD to that disk or even partition but it's like again I think with most tools there that take away certain aspects at least in regards to the installation or configuration so that those points are taken away but it lies in regards to configuring SAF or even certain aspects you can do everything as normal and at least from well from experience with SAF it I guess to put like that has gotten a lot better as with the now tell me the the now the config store the config store as it basically says you have like well config store in the monitors where you can just easily set for certain components instead of always having to manually make changes to any config files on the servers on your storage nodes themselves and it has gotten better that's awesome I think I would just like to say a lot of places it gives you a control as well right because I mean operator is responsible for reconciliation and taking charge when we I mean off automatic automated scenarios where we want recovery to happen right and SAF the goal is to improve recovery and in productions you don't need any unexpected loss of control as well right we would want to give admins a certain level of control we don't want them to go ahead and I mean play around with the ways these so I think I mean in in ways you in many of the production production scenarios you need a certain set of control as well which Rook actually provides so I mean at that point I would certainly recommend and consider it as an advantage as well um question is if there's going to be a performance hits in regards to running SAF in Kubernetes depends on how you run it if you run it like I'm personally preferring running the my Rook SAF clusters always with host network but you kind of can already depending on how far you're with container of companies it goes over well host network some like that some don't I personally do more or less just do it because I don't want the traffic to go over the overlay network as you have some plug-in some CNI container network interface when you want who wants to look into that that takes care of the network between between your notes so it more or less depends there's a lot of people using well just having Rook SAF talk over the overlay network as well it works fine as well it's just a preference I would really more or less put it at and depending on what your network looks like if you have 10g or something and your overlay network in the end maybe brings the like in an iPerf test at least brings it down to like nine point something you know like is it worth exposing that traffic to the host network then versus just having it go over the overlay network but again if you think about it just like another layer to consider if you want that if you don't and if you don't want that there's also options like Maltos to allow you some more fine-grained network connections or config in regards to the interfaces you want to pass in like different VLANs or something but that's like again it depends yeah can you still manage your SAF cluster via the SAF dashboard or is it another dashboard or do you need two dashboards or the question was if you can still use the SAF dashboard maybe just to expand on that SAF manager dashboard just to manage your SAF cluster to some degree there is currently not a functionality to add new OSDs I think if I remember correctly that's one thing as well with the future roadmap part with the more managerability where I also kind of looked at the dashboard and was like wait I have a grid but why oh why don't we but then it's the typical oh there's some road blocks that we just need to get out of the way and make sure that like we are all like especially with operator and even SAF ADM and others out there we're all aligned on the same way or if there's like a manager interface because there is even one and there I think if I understood you correctly or heard from the meetings correctly they're even looking into improving that interface further it will hopefully be easier thankfully also faster to have the dashboard as this point of contact as well yeah there's a lot of current work that there's a lot of work that is currently going on I'll just keep it I'll just say that there's a lot of work going on currently in the usability space from the recent discussions in upstream that we have had there's a to improve dashboard as well from both CUBE CTL from both Kubernetes and old standalone SAF perspective it's to make sure that I mean you can easily manage and monitor SAF in even in the CNCF world there has been recent discussions that have happened to improve it as well from Rook space so a lot of work is going on in the usability space but if you have any ideas it'll be most welcome and really it would be great to have I mean it's usability is one thing that really matters a lot right we I mean user experience is one thing that I mean we would certainly cater to improve in Rook I think we have time for one more question so the question is if could I maybe modify it a bit more into the direction of like how could can you run Rook I guess I think the place into that as well like you can run Rook SAF you can run Rook SAF in a way that you connect it to an existing SAF cluster that it doesn't even matter if it's a Rook SAF cluster just the SAF cluster works as well it mainly takes care of then just setting up the CSI driver then I know people use that to some degree as well if they have an existing or even an existing Rook SAF cluster that they want to share with the others there's also in this external mode the possibility of the Rook SAF operator to manage certain components so that for example if you want a file system you could run those MDS demons that you need for the file system in that cluster that your Kubernetes is running on then that works as well it's kind of like those two main external modes and obviously the case of running it in the same cluster that's kind of like this either you just share what you have or share and allow like SAF file system or SAF objects or you can just run the demons on in the cluster in the same cluster then both works for all the operator does that answer that then any other question there are no questions there are a bunch of stickers here for everyone yeah stickers and if you've asked the question just now just come see me you've got a t-shirt too and maybe there's some left over after that", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 21.68, "text": " Hi, everyone.
