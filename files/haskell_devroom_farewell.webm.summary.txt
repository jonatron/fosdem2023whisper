The speaker thanks the attendees and presenters at the first Haskell bedroom at FOSDEM, as well as the event organizers and volunteers. The speaker also announces a prize draw for three copies of Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton, donated by the Haskell Foundation. Using a monad and a random number generator, the speaker selects the winners and awards the prizes. The talk concludes with a wrap-up and thank you to all.
