Thank you very much for having me. Do you hear me back there? Lovely. All right. Okay.

00:21.760 --> 00:28.000
I'm Conrad and I have the opposite of problems and I have a million of problems compared

00:28.000 --> 00:33.760
to Geron because Geron had performance issues. That was the things before and he tried to

00:33.760 --> 00:40.880
parse DNS zone files really fast in the I2P network, which is an overlay network which

00:40.880 --> 00:47.080
provides anonymity. We have that few hosts. We don't even need to think about performance.

00:47.080 --> 00:51.400
We have, as I said, one million other problems. Now, the students of the University of Applied

00:51.400 --> 00:57.920
Science got the job from me to take a look at this DNS problem because the I2P network

00:57.920 --> 01:01.200
has no DNS. So welcome to Stone Age.
