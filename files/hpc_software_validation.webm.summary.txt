The talk presented at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 by Julia Anon from Paratools focused on testing and validation in the context of developing an MPI runtime. The speaker discussed the challenges faced while using custom shell scripts for validation and the need for a more efficient and scalable validation system. They introduced PCVS, a testing framework written in Python that aims to simplify the process of writing and running tests for HPC environments. PCVS allows users to define benchmarks and test scenarios, automatically retargets the tests based on the runtime and compiler, and can scale the test suite to different environments. The speaker also mentioned the architecture and features of PCVS, including run-time analysis and the ability to generate trends and statistics over time. They concluded by mentioning future work, such as integrating metrics and exploring graphical front-end options. The Q&A section addressed questions about resource allocation and potential graphical front-end frameworks.
