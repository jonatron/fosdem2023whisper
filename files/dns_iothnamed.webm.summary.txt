The talk is about the internet of threads and how it's one step farther than the internet of hosts. It involves enabling even threads or processes within processes to have IP addresses. The speaker discusses the implementation of the Libyot library for the internet of threads, which is a framework that allows for loading actual implementations for network stacks as plugins. The speaker also talks about the need for an ecosystem around this idea, including the implementation of internal threads for various tools and scenarios like managing DNS servers for IPv6, one-time IP security features, and using different stacks for delegated domains. During the Q&A, there are questions about the overhead and latency of using a network stack in every thread.
