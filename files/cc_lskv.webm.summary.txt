The talk by Andrew Jeffery from the University of Cambridge is about LSKB, a new data store aiming to democratize confidential computing. LSKB replaces CD, a distributed key value store, and runs inside an SGX enclave to provide confidentiality and integrity. It has an HCD-compatible API and offers additional features like receipts for detecting untrustworthy proxies. LSKB is faster than CD, providing higher throughput and lower latency. However, it is optimistically consistent, replicating data asynchronously instead of synchronously like CD. The speaker also mentions the Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF) , which LSKB builds upon to manage interactions and roles in a distributed system. Finally, the speaker encourages attendees to check out the open-source LSKB GitHub repo for more information.
