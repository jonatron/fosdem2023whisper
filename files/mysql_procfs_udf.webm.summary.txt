The speaker talks about the PROCFS plugin that Percona developed to monitor Linux metrics without an agent on the server. The talk covers what to monitor in a database, the importance of monitoring, and the difference between agent and agentless monitoring. The presenter explains how to install and use the PROCFS plugin, and how to integrate it with Prometheus and PMM from Percona. The talk also addresses limitations of the plugin, such as only working with the same version of Percona server and only collecting specified metrics. The Q&A section includes questions about the plugin's frequency of collection and memory usage. The speaker also mentions that the plugin was developed by Nikolai from Percona and is experimental, but the company's engineering team may continue the project in the future.
