{"text": " it's green now okay now it's fine okay again sorry for those online it was muted the whole time yeah so let's follow through consistency like the design must be consistent or when worse is better the design must not be overly inconsistent right and and he also starts to look about priorities and we'll get to that like in the list world in the view of the right thing consistency is as important as correctness right whereas in the unique style worse is better well consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases but if you have to do that it's actually better to drop the feature all together if it's not that important right so that so it's better to drop the parts that are that deal with less common circumstances rather to introduce more complexity or inconsistency right so that's one way to keep it consistent is like not add more inconsistent stuff right if that was supposed to break down with the simplicity like and finally the the completeness both of them want the design to cover as many important situations as practical or reasonably expected cases should be covered right but in the right thing way of thinking completeness and consistency are what matter the most so that simplicity is not allowed to reduce completeness whereas in the unix world the unique way of thinking Lord in worse is better it can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality right consistency can be sacrificed to get completeness if not at the cost of simplicity right so these are these are different ways of working that are concerned with the same things and they are similar on the surface but as you go deep they are very different right and both of them work like they're both proven and they both built very successful software right so but what we can get out of this like what does it matter for us okay it's interesting that in the 90s someone wrote about this and identified this two ways of thinking but what matters for us in our everyday development is that there is no one right way to do like minimalistic software there are in the decision space in the design space there are forks in the road where you will be faced with decisions like okay I want to make this software clean and minimal and nice but okay do what do it this way or do it do it that way right there will be forks in the road and I'm gonna talk about all the ways that I got that wrong right so we will see what happens when things go wrong even if you have your best intentions of making clear and nice and simple minimalistic software right so bit of context I've been involved as like Andy said like many of us said we're all getting older like I've been involved with the Lua community for Lua programming language for like almost like 20 years now and yeah here's me at like the first Lua workshop back in 2005 like and giving a talk on a piece of software that I wrote so I was talking about how nice it was and like now 20 years later I talk about how terrible this after I write it right so yeah that's called maturing right so yeah so so yeah so this is Lua is like an example of like a very nice like minimalistic language like the whole source distribution is like 360k right and that includes like the bytecode compiler the VM the standard library like an amazing C API which is like stack based and like it's a triumph of like the power of simplicity and all that and the these three guys here who are is this and this they are like the creators of Lua and they have said like time and again how influenced they were by scheme right so but if you look at the surface it's like an all-goal style syntax it's like no parentheses and all of that right but like in essence you know because there are very much in that spirit of the right thing like it's it's it's very much in that mindset right but then when you get minimalistic systems like that and minimalistic languages right you end up with that batteries not included effect because that's how you get like such a simple and small thing right but when you have to interact with the real world the language that the minimalistic system is like the tip of the iceberg right because you have to deal with xml parsing and json and various protocols and all of those such things right so like you have to build on top of that little minimalistic base right so how do you deal with that we go modular right the idea is that instead of having that you know that big monster system with like every capability under the sun where that you see in some environment build like the smaller system that you can right so enter lure ox which is like a module manager a package manager for modules for the Lua programming language when I first got involved with that Lua had no package manager and and this was a project that we started around 2006 that so it's been like I was like around 15 years that I've been maintaining this project right and I know I know I understand if many people here don't like language specific package managers I know because in my other hat like I'm at this Linux distro maintainer and I know the pain that they can be but yeah like I have extra slides about that in the end if it becomes like a topic but let's agree that for many situations the necessary evil right to have them like so the story of making lure ox like it started with some sets of challenges because Lua was designed to be an embedded language so people run it like you have like an engine X server like as we do at Kong and where we have like a Lua Lua VMs embedded into it or you have like games and tons of games that were Lua first got really popular where you have like Lua scripting embedded in it so the idea is that you take that small language you put inside your large application you hook one to the other via the C API and then your scripts gets the functionality of the host application right and you can write scripts that control your game or which handle your requests and and all of that stuff but what ended up happening is that at the time we started lure ox and again I think I'm using Andy's like royal we in this case there was no one Lua community there was several scattered Lua communities right because most of the applications were like this were embedded applications and even though there were some modules here and there that you could use there was no convenient way to use them all together and build like pure Lua applications right so one of the goals was not just create the package manager but also kind of create that community of usage of modules right so I so we kind of have a had a point to prove right with with the with the system so yeah so to kind of try to prove that point right from the beginning I decided okay let's make lure ox the package manager into a pure Lua application of the kind that I want to show that it's possible once you have an ecosystem of modules right so we can do like the proverbial dog footing right so yeah so so we set out from from beginning with that idea right and that proof challenging because how do you make a system based on you know packages and modules when you don't have a package manager yet right you you get it you get into that like who watches the watchman situation like who packages the packages for the package manager and yeah so then of course we get to the the solution is bootstrapping right so I guess as open source developer right for the love of the like the will of the open source developers to show the products worth by dog footing like and like compilers and programming language people like like to show the worth of their systems by bootstrapping it by building it in itself right so so that's what we did like so we had a file system operation because that's generally what package manager do is a bunch of file system operations like moving files around calling calling other compilers and things like that building stuff and you know putting things in the right places so we had a library of file system abstractions and we made like an initial bootstrap version of that library which would have zero dependencies it would like because like core luon like has shell out command like a system can do like a CLI call right so we could so we made a library in terms of those operations that that was like the bootstrap version right so that we can that we could then build the rest on top right as I said who watches the watchman so we ended up with these two versions like the bootstrapping version and and the dog footing version and so this one could run with zero dependencies but then once you had the ability to install additional modules this one ran all of the file system operations in process so it ran a much faster right so because of deployment into systems and new operating systems that did not have any support yet we ended up having to maintain both of them in the code base right so there you start notice that things are getting smelly right like it's no longer that minimalistic anymore when you have like these two different implementations of right off your core libraries around plus the real world keeps getting in the way and once you have those little like Unix CLI abstractions often you start to have like to put little additions because some of the OS's are different right and then as time goes by you have to make an entire different implementation in order to support windows as well right so yeah so things are things are not getting like looking any nicer right yeah plus over time people start asking like this is a package manager you told us that low rocks was a pure low application why can't I like upgrade it in itself you know just run low rocks install low rocks and I looked at it and then I thought about like the two different bootstrapping situations and all of the complications that that would happen and after a while like I caved in I said okay let's try to do this we've done this for a while it worked if you had the exact same set of circumstances in your system you know for in order to that to work because lower rocks can be installed like in a home in a home folder without permissions as a system-wide package with permissions installed by the package manager installed by yourself from sources or if it's on windows then windows you cannot modify files that are currently open unlike in Unix so over time we ended up dropping this one because now this is no longer supported like so you actually have to install lower rocks by some other means right but yeah so but we really tried so another point where like the idea of minimalism kind of backfired was the definition of the scope of the project itself so especially because I was coming from experience of being a maintainer for a Linux distro and writing the package manager for that Linux distro as well so I had a bunch of experience in in package management and the development of that area I decided from from the beginning and said like this is gonna be a package manager for Lua modules specifically and Lua modules can be written either in Lua like .lua files which contain like source code or they can be actually see dynamic libraries like .so files or .dll files right which are like C programs that use the Lua C API and built into a library that can be loaded by Lua at runtime right and I limited the scope and said that's this is it right because I don't want people to start making like crazy hacks with it because I knew that once people would start doing crazy hacks with it they would start stepping on the toes of the operating system package manager like even more than language package managers already do right because I've had people ask me things like oh I have some Lua stuff that integrates with a JVM I would love to distribute my Java files and classes with Lua rocks right I've heard all sorts of things like that so at first I thought the decision was right but then there were things like okay I'm doing web applications and I need assets like CSS and things like that that actually have a legitimate case of being distributed with that right or I'm making a game and my graphics like they need to come along with that and all of that and at first I say well if you're making like a whole application like you can use Lua rocks for your modules and then you have to package it some other way that would make sense if you're thinking with the hat of OS package manager but in the end people would just end up like doing like crazy hacks like you know renaming their files like .lua to please Lua rocks so that they wouldn't install it and then load it by other means and all the things like that and and and I myself was guilty of that at some point in which like I made a Lua module that could read the Lua rocks metadata and find out where Lua rocks it's install it's like documentation files and you could put like other files in there and things like that so it's kind of like you know like I should have put like a Jeff Goldblum slide saying life finds a way you know so for this one maybe you can add it in post and add that so yeah so the next story I think this is the third this is the third story of the so Lua keeps its simplicity by having this model of mechanism not policies like people ask for features and the Lua authors do not give them the features they give them like the mechanisms in which you can actually write the feature right so instead of having a debug error Lua has like a debug API which can provide you like you can call functions and get information of the about the debug state and people has used that to write debuggers and IDs and all sorts of things right so it's a it's it sounds sounded to me like a smart way of keeping things minimal and and bounded right while being very principle about how they do it you know the right way so so in Lua rocks kind of tried kind of trying to find the to follow the same path and going well when in doubt make making a sensible right for various things for example like how to download code from the internet in order to make your packages right back like nowadays the whole version control wars are done and get has won right but at the beginning like around 2006 you would have like subversion and mercurial and fossil and darks and all of the other ones that no one else remembers anymore and so yeah so so it came up with the whole thing where okay so depending on who what you used in the protocol if you put like get you know colon slash slash or if you put like foobar it would try to load the foobar module and see if you know if we had like hooks in order to download stuff and and things like that the side effect is now now we have the code base like modules there for a version control systems that I'm sure no one has used like for over 10 years and they're still there in the code base right as extensions and things like that extensible build types another aspect of that you know you know heard of cats that was the Lua community and then the various subcommunities around it was that everyone was building before Lua rocks existed everyone was building their module like their own way right some people use C make some people use make some people just put the code out there and say like compile it yourself you figure it out right and and I didn't want like some people use like configure with auto tools and all of that right so I didn't want to annoy anyone because the goal really was to get a community formed around it and not like segregate anyone so we did the same thing with the build types right but this time I kind of followed my unixie itch and I went like full worse is better on it and in addition of all that is those extensible build types I create one that I just called like built in like a total lack of creativity which was like kind of like make you know like just get a list of things to do and things to compile but like without any sort of like dependency resolution not anything like I was like super dummy was just go through the list one by one call the compiler get things done and recently like a few years ago like I I ran the numbers on the whole rocks repository like thousands and thousands of packages and like 80% of them were all using the built-in mode because like the most common cases they are is that your lure modules just a couple of Lua files and not even or it's a single C file like so that one like it it really was that one was a success right so in that sense and the last example is like configuration this is also not supposed to be read like it's just supposed to be like how big are is the response when you run like low rocks config because at first because everyone was using their own like little ways of running Lua I made like every single path and sub path and folder name like oh do you want your includes to be in a folder called include or do you want your bin to be in a folk art bin so nothing ever is hard-coded in there right so end result I've barely seen people like customizing all those deep configurations plus people tell me that the configuration is super complicated and sometimes people who would maybe like solve their problem by changing those things they just can't just can't find which is you know the proper entry to fix because you know because there are so many options and they're so very similar like runtime external depth subdirectories and like runtime external depth patterns because maybe in our different operating system where it doesn't end with SO and things like that so all of that is but but it was I kind of overshot in making it you know too configurable right so now by now you must be convinced that low rocks is like the worst piece of software in the history of mankind and or at least the worst package manager out of them but if you think about it like on paper low rocks is like the minimalist's dream package manager right it has zero dependencies it dogfoods its own optional dependencies it has a well-defined scope in terms of you know the files that it manages it's built like its internal APIs are built on a minimal base yet it's extensible right so what went wrong right I guess in the end but what happened is that it also ended up becoming like the kind of thing that minimalists despise the most right because it ended up and ended up being a large system that tries to be all things for all people right so well let's make the extensible then people start extending it in so it started growing in all sorts of directions right so what happened why why did why why we got to that point like two things one was that like the realization that reducing complexity is different from shifting complexity around right you say well I made a minimal base and now and now this is extensible but then all of the extensions was were bundled right so I so I still have code around for maintaining all all of those like old deprecated version control systems and things like that because they were all part of off the core application still right so many of the extensible bits they they kind of like if you were to use like a third-party extension sort of felt like a second-class citizen like you would have to add like an additional build dependency for that so and and and things like that and second the world is dynamic like things change and when we talk about design people often think about design as a blueprint but a blueprint you know it's something that you'd like before you start building the house right so so people tend to see design a lot like a initial step right you have to design then you have to build but the world keeps changing the requirements keep changing like stuff keeps changing and you keep accommodating for those changes so you have to think about how you're going to keep your minimalism over time right because it's easy to start small and then and then it spirals out of control so that got me thinking a lot like the sort of like the final section here of the thought about it is that that got me thinking about like minimalistic software maintenance because it's nice to you know you think about like oh this nice and small like piece of software like as a something like still in time or at the beginning but you have to think how do you make it how do you make that work over time you know and keep those principles and the way to do that is by setting boundaries and and that's one thing that that worse is better system that like that puts simplicity at the front so it does that well it's like a lot you know cuz that really like it stops from like say oh we're gonna drop a feature if it reduces simplicity or we're gonna make it a little inconsistent as long we keep everything simple because simple is more easily maintainable right because things can be like complete and consistent and end up being super complicated right so for example like one example within the realm of like the right thing philosophy I think was that the little language itself it favors simplicity over compatibility right because they they do put consistency and completeness like and in first place right but also like the right way style of managing that growing complexity is by changing your definition of complete right or limiting your definition of complete right then you like if you want to go for completeness and you want to still be minimal like you have to put a bound on your definition of complete right so so the way they did it was that okay we have to make changes all right what are we gonna take out what are we gonna you know in order in order to keep that going so so basically in Lua every like major version which is like every 5x version five one five two five three they are essentially different versions of the language in terms of like even like source code gets incompatible because they make changes that break things right like as long as they keep the design consistent and complete within their definition of completeness right so yeah and and when we think about is like the easiest way to go is to go like the Unix approach which is if you if if you just follow the way of keeping simplicity then you do get that long-term maintainability and even in the original essay Richard Gabriel said like he said here like I have intentionally caricature the worst is better philosophy to convince you that it's obviously a bad philosophy and that that New Jersey like the Bell Labs Unix approach is a bad approach however I believe that worse is better even in its strong and form we watch that caricature of you know like everything simplicity is more important than correctness and things like that has better survival characteristics right then the right thing and it's interesting because survival characteristics gives you the sense of like something happening over time right you keep surviving right so so here isn't directly talking about maintenance like about long-term success of the project right not that's something that was like oh I dreamed it up one day and I came up you know with with Lisp and wrote a paper and that's it like okay what happens with Lisp over time right and so it's so he said that in line one right he said oh it's a you know the New Jersey approach when used for software is a better approach than the MIT approach like said that later he wrote another paper that called that's what's called worse is better is worse right because he was still trying to advocate for a list approach but things can't get out of hand like and then you remember if you remember that Richard Gaber was involved with common Lisp right which is not exactly minimalistic right so that's why that that's what can end up happening right so why are the lessons learned like what about lure rocks you know what can we do about it like after all this time right there are things that I'm thinking about doing like this is like this whole talk is like the foreshadowing of the changes that I plan to make into the work all right so yeah that's like the last talk so we have a little bit of a relax all right so yeah that's the last last couple of slides here so just to say like we can still provide zero dependencies for users if we vendor in our bootstrap dependencies so we don't have to deal with bootstrapping anymore because like now we know 15 years later that the base set of dependencies really doesn't change over time right like we need a socket library we did an SSL library we need you know just a little couple of things right we can still make it zero dependencies for users and we can manage like a small set of libraries that we keep need to maintain ourselves right so that whole you know set of boots can be done away with like we could like simplify the scope and you know so that people don't have to do hacks in order to use assets and things like that because we do present it like and then it goes back to the whole right thing and worse is better right because the concerns with implementation versus interface because I was very concerned of presenting a cleaning interface you only deal with lua modules but the internal implementation was that lure rocks and it's internal it's a general purpose package manager has to deal with files moving around in a completely general manner right so we could just expose that to users and trust their ability to you know not mess up with the files like if they say like I'm gonna put them in this folder then alright we just we'll just put it there for them right and the other thing is that yeah the idea of the extensible minimal base is a good one but it should be a minimal base that it's extensible not like already extended right and the way to do this is that the extensions need to feel like first-class citizens like just like you know the rest of the code and not have things like okay these if you use this bill type you don't have to pull in anything else but for this time this one you do right so if you if you put everything in an even playing field then you can keep your base small right so in the end yeah it's still about simplicity correctness completeness and consistency but I would say and as we get older and start learning those lessons about how time matters is that you need to think about simplicity over time correctness over time completeness over time consistency over time now I'm over time so thank you do you have any questions or should we go for the drink last we have questions okay what do you mean by that a moment very overwhelmed by amaziness yes yes yes yes so yeah thank you for allowing me to talk about the good parts yeah there was a to me a turning point moment was I think well I think like law rocks are 2006 I was hired to do a law consulting project around 2013 so that was like quite a few years afterwards in which I had the experience of using lower rocks as a user with a deadline who actually had to put up something together that solved a real world problem for the customer and I needed like protocol buffers and lots of things from the real world and I was actually like able to I was so used to having to come up with everything on my own in lua and then like okay lower locks install lua protobuf well it actually works like okay now in an XML and I pull like five six seven eight different packages and actually got my problem solved in a way that was much faster and I felt like yeah okay the yeah this is the actual park you know like like the it is a reality like it you only believe it when you use it right and sometimes the people who make the software and other people using it right so you don't actually get to experience that but but yes like I think the part about the building an ecosystem that was a success in the end right we actually have an ecosystem now any other questions over there yes so that's that's the slide I prepared for this topic yeah so yeah so like language based package managers and open system package managers right because whenever people are you know reticence to the idea of language package managers they go like oh why don't we instead just instead packages all as insert my favorite package style like why don't we just do deb files for everything or why don't we just do geeks for everything why don't we just do rpm for everything why won't we just do you know macOS whatever they use now things right so it turns out that it's so one okay this alone would sort of answer right but then again there's another argument of scale because if you think about like how many packages do just debian which is one of the largest distributions have like I think like last I checked a couple of years ago it was like something like 60,000 packages right must be higher now right the JavaScript okay JavaScript is the worst example okay so let's take something like this JavaScript is over a million packages right so that's let's call that too much right but take something in the middle like Ruby Jam's like will easily have over a hundred thousand right or maybe like two hundred thousand by now right so like the set of modules of a language ecosystem would easily overwhelm like the pack like the old package management overhead of the community of that distribution like so if you do the math the matrix of like every operating system and Linux distro versus every language out there right doesn't add up like this so you kind of have to have language module managers on one side and system managers on the other and okay this was the funniest slide okay this is actually the actual slide so actually we're a paper on this problem right which was rejected many many times because you have operating system conferences and you have programming language conferences and package manager is always everyone else's problem right and I was there like living at that crossroads like these that the other two guys like Lucas from IBM Research and Michael from Victoria University in New Zealand they were both developers of global Linux was also the Linux distro that we were developing together right so so we're all coming from and Michael is a researcher in programming language department as well right so so we so we had like and like Lucas works with operating systems so and I'm sort of in between so yeah so so it took a while right so that was this this was in a rare like PLOS programming language operating system workshop that happened within SOSP which is an operating system conference and at last that that got like accepted because we came up with a taxonomy of like identifying the different types of package managers and what do they get right and wrong because yeah they do step on each other's toes a lot and yeah this this paper has some recommendation on how not to because low rocks was very careful not to step on top of the toes and now we're gonna be kicked out of the room let's go out and have some beers thank
