{"text": " Good morning, everyone. We're starting without slides because the projector isn't connected yet and we're going to keep trying to troubleshoot that. So thank you so much for coming. My name is Elena Finnedrecht. I'm here with the Foundation for Public Code. Welcome to the Public Code and Digital Public Goods Dev Room. I'm going to start with two really quick housekeeping things and then give a really fast pitch for the Foundation for Public Code, so you know why we're here. And then Veepal, who is my co-host from the Digital Public Goods Alliance, will give an intro to the Digital Public Goods Alliance. So as housekeeping, one, we're following Fossum's Code of Conduct here. Please be respectful while you're in the space. And two, I've opened some windows so that we have ventilation so that everyone can be comfortable being here. Please leave them open. I don't think it's a big issue about people closing them today. There's not very many of you. But yeah, but we'll leave them open throughout the session. So thank you for coming. We're delighted that you're here at our second Public Code Dev Room. Our first one was last year. It was online. This year, we're hosting it jointly with the Digital Public Goods Alliance because the Foundation for Public Code is proud that we're a Digital Public Goods Alliance member. And again, you'll hear more about what that means in a sec. And very importantly, because we believe that Public Code has the potential to make a significant contribution to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. So first, what is Public Code? Public Code is open source code that implements public policy. It's used for the public good, and it's used by public organizations like governments, public administrations, and state corporations. This morning, you'll hear more about two super interesting public code COVID-related projects. You'll hear about best practice for Digital Public Goods and Public Code, and about the policy environment in Europe. And so quite quickly, just an intro to who the Foundation for Public Code is. We're a non-profit founded in 2019 in Amsterdam. My slide would say that we provide tools and processes that bring people and institutions together to collaboratively build and maintain software as public infrastructure. My speaker notes, which would have complimented that slide, say that we exist because there's plenty of governments that are able to build public code code bases, but then they don't necessarily have the mandate to make the communities around those code bases thrive, to build actual public collaborations that ensure that the code bases are being reused, that they're growing, that they're living code bases. And so the Foundation for Public Code exists to help public code bases grow real sustainable communities so that the code bases are used in more than one place, and public organizations can actually benefit from the scaling potential of open source. Quickly, what do we do at the Foundation for Public Code? The most important thing we do is code-based stewardship, and our stewards take the role of a coach. They help to bring the most out of a community by helping, by giving the code base the best possible conditions to succeed. We do this by checking code quality, by organizing community events and helping the community thrive, for example, community calls, helping to develop the code base as a mature product, for example, by assisting with branding and communications around it, and developing training materials, and helping people who are implementing the code base, like vendors so that they can attract more people, they can help more organizations use the code base as well. The next thing we do is work on the standard for public code. There's copies there, and this is a set of criteria that supports public organizations in developing and maintaining software and policy together. It includes best practice guidance for policymakers, government administrators, developers, and vendors, and code bases that meet the standard are easy to collaborate on and to reuse. It's both fundamental for our own work, and it's a recognized digital public good. We recommend that as a resource for other digital public goods. And then finally, we do capacity building work for public organizations, like workshops and training, and an example of that is our governance game, which is an actual game, it's fun to play, but it lets people explore what's needed to govern a code base, what the various roles and complexities are in keeping code base governance balanced and flexible enough to be usable. And services issues worth considering during setup, and in the game context that includes things like Godzilla, but it also might include real things, so there's a rogue developer card, so what happens when you have somebody who doesn't follow the agreed governance. And so it's useful for visualizing how the current governance model is set up or how it could be changed as well. If you work with an ambitious public code base that might benefit from more support to grow internationally, or if any of our tools or approaches sound intriguing, come chat with me, or Kehinde, at one of the breaks. And that's us from the Foundation for Public Code. So on to people from the Digital Public Good Alliance. Of course, yeah. There we go. Thank you. So technical issues, people getting sick, it's all kind of thing going on right now. So sorry for the delays and sorry for all the things. Not as expected, like projector working for now, but I think it should be fixed. I just wanted to quickly run by what Digital Public Good is and Digital Public Good Alliance is. But before that, a quick short story, when COVID started, there's this tool called DHIS2, which was a Digital Public Good back there, and it was used in 76 countries, 73 countries, and it's a digital health, health metrics information collecting tool. And when the first COVID outbreak in Sri Lanka was recognized on January 27th of 2020, within two days, the developer community of there were able to change it, modify to start tracking COVID patients coming from different highly contagious areas. And because of such fast work, in several next few days, it was deployed and started being used. That's not even the most impressive part. Within the next few weeks of that, it was already being adopted in 73 plus countries. And till now, it has located and counted and tracked 3.8 billion people, which is 40% of the world population. And all of it was possible because it has open licenses. It had a community around it, and it was targeting a critical need that the world needed. In Digital Public Goods Alliance, we call these things called Digital Public Good, obviously. These are open source technologies or content, software, data models, it could be anything, which follows and adheres relevant best practices, do not harm, and advances the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. So these three are the heart of what we call Digital Public Good. Later on, when expanded, it has nine indicators from proper licensing, documentation, not collecting PII's information, must be platform independent, so you should not be dependent on a proprietary solution that can prevent you from further scaling up. And all of these nine indicators help us nominate and decide Digital Public Good. Very easy to nominate a software. If you have a link, SubmissionStartDigitalPublicGood.net, you go there, you nominate your project, there will be a technical review of it, and once done, it's recognized on the registry. Today, we have recognized 127 public goods, and it's continuously increasing at faster rate than ever. So DPGA, started by UNICEF, the government of Norway, government of Sierra Leone, and ISPRIT. At this point, we have a lot more organizations together with it, and if you attended the keynote yesterday, the fresh announcement is Open Source Initiative is also in the DPGA, in the Alliance now. We have Bill and Belinda Gates Foundation, Github, UNDP, USAID, and a lot more. It's a multi-stakeholder alliance founded by UNICEF and others, but today DPGA has expanded a lot. And the advantage of being certified, you have discoverability. If your tool is there, it's easy to discover for a lot of people to identify, well, not just contribution, but to adapt it for their critical need, support for usability, and deployment capacity, because there are pathfinder countries who will work with you to adapt that solution and utilize them. Within UNICEF, we also have programs, DPGA accelerator programs, where we'll take a DPGA digital public good solution and try to pilot it in countries where it can be actually used for good. Just wanted to keep it short, because we are running late, and again at 1040 or 1050, I have my talk where we'll again refresh this thing in maybe more details. But you can go to digitalpublicgood.net, read more about us, what we do, and you can submit your solutions at submissions.digitalpublicgood.net. That's me, and thank you for coming today. And I think we have projectors fixed, so for the next talk, we can start giving up.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.24, "text": " Good morning, everyone.
