Phil then proceeds to discuss the landscape of container developer tooling and the various solutions available for developers to use depending on their operating system. He provides an overview of the major technologies and tools such as ContainerD, Podman, Lima, NerdCTL, and Rancher Desktop. The project Finch, developed by Phil's team in AWS, is also introduced as a new container interloop lifecycle solution built on top of Lima, NerdCTL, and BuildKit. Phil explains the motivation behind creating Fiinch was to simplify the command line tool, as opposed to the GUI-centered focus of other projects. The session ends with a short Q&A section.
