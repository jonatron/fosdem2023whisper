 Okay.

This talk focused on using High Performance Computing and Nix to speed up and optimize the process of program development and experimentation. It discussed how the cross-compiler based on the LBM can be used to translate pragmas into function calls to a runtime, as well as how to work with the SLURM diamond, how to use LD library path, and how to install Nix packages. It also described the NixWrap tool which enables the development and experimentation process to occur in an isolated environment, as well as how to override compiler flag and how to prevent software from accessing system paths.
