In this talk, Arjen's Japanese discusses his project involving knitting and live view. He explains his background in programming and his interest in AI and art. He then describes how he and his colleague began working on a project to create a knitting installation for a conference. They bought an old knitting machine and used an Arduino to control it. Arjen's explains the challenges he faced in automating the machine and the parameters he had to adjust for successful knitting. He then introduces live view as a solution for creating interactive user interfaces in Elixir. He explains how live view works and demonstrates how it can be used to update the state of a knitting machine emulator in real time. He also mentions other features of live view, such as function components and live components. Arjen's concludes by expressing his excitement about the possibilities of live view and the growing community surrounding it.
