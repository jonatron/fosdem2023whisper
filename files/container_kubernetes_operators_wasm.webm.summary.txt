 And so the parent operator that we have, that we provide right now, it basically just caches all the requests. So the child operators are already, they already interface with the Kubernetes API through the parent operator. And, yeah, so the parent operator basically provides caching for the child operator at the same time, like a watch-based caching, as you said, but also normal request/ response caching. Tell us explicitly what the summary is. 

In this talk, Merlin discussed their research on using lightweight Kubernetes operators written in WebAssembly for edge computing applications. It was shown that WebAssembly operators use 50% less RAM than their Docker container equivalents, and have superior latency. An optimized build system and predictive unloading are currently being developed, as well as patches for KubeRS and an extension for the WebAssembly system interface for upstreaming.
