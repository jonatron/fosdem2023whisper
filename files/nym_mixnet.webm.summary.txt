The NIM mixed net is a new anonymous communication network that tackles the challenge of surveillance by entities that collect massive amounts of data on a global scale. This is achieved by mixing data through an overlay network using a cloud of nodes, with each packet individually mixed and wrapped in layers of encryption to hide its destination. The network directory is a set of validators running a consensus protocol that tracks mixed nodes and gateways and provides bandwidth credentials. The network is free to use and relies on community contributions for its vision of a self-running system in the future. The NIM framework could be integrated into other privacy platforms as it operates at the transport layer. The NIM mixed net is not meant to replace other privacy systems, but rather complement them for different types of applications.
