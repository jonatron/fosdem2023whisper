WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.800
Good afternoon. Are you ready? Martin, how many times did I tell you not to sedate the

00:12.800 --> 00:17.400
audience when we give a presentation? I think this was a marketing ploy, wasn't it?

00:17.400 --> 00:24.640
Let's try this again. Are you ready? Much better. Welcome to our presentation on Linux

00:24.640 --> 00:28.360
in loss. This is us. More like a talk than a presentation because

00:28.360 --> 00:36.760
there's only one slide. This is us. Yeah, so if you like knowledge or madness,

00:36.760 --> 00:42.720
either is good. Welcome. So just of curiosity, how many people of you

00:42.720 --> 00:50.720
listen to podcasts? Very good. Pretty much everybody, right? Wow. How many people have

00:50.720 --> 00:59.000
heard prior to this gig about Linux in loss? Okay. Our two listeners are here. Wait. Martin,

00:59.000 --> 01:10.720
Martin, Martin. This is all planned. Ah, yes, yes. Did you win the bet,

01:10.720 --> 01:17.240
by any chance? Because Martin now just won officially the bet. So how many people actually

01:17.240 --> 01:24.080
have listened to one of our episodes prior to the presentation? This one gets the bottom

01:24.080 --> 01:29.720
up. After the presentation, please collect your price. Indeed, indeed. Well done, that man.

01:29.720 --> 01:37.800
Okay. On with the show. Yes. So thank you all for coming. So today is really about getting an

01:37.800 --> 01:43.200
idea of what our podcast is like, which is generally very free-flowing and well-prepared.

01:43.200 --> 01:49.320
Yes, but maybe before we go into the details, maybe we should kind of introduce ourselves

01:49.320 --> 01:55.680
more formally. Yes, yes. I'm Chris. I'm Martin. Actually, it's the other way around. This is

01:55.680 --> 02:00.480
Martin Visser. My name is Chris Simmerman. You want to say something about you? Sure,

02:00.480 --> 02:05.520
sure. So, yes, as you, well, some of you who may know that listen to our podcast,

02:05.520 --> 02:10.680
we've been doing some IT stuff for a bit. Chris is retired now, so he just does it as a hobby.

02:10.680 --> 02:17.360
But yeah, this is us. Martin has about 20 years of international arms trade, drug-crafting,

02:17.360 --> 02:24.520
and other professional activities, but no jokes aside. My name is Chris Simmerman. I have been

02:24.520 --> 02:33.720
using open source for the last 30 plus years. And I also run Lurken in Germany. The Lark Frankfurt

02:33.720 --> 02:41.760
have been doing community events for 10 years, and about three years ago, but more about that in

02:41.760 --> 02:46.480
a minute, we decided to start this podcast. So, Martin, what did you do prior to the podcast?

02:46.480 --> 02:54.400
Prior to the podcast. Well, so yeah, like yourself, been in IT since the year dot, messing around

02:54.400 --> 03:00.440
with PDP11s and all that kind of stuff. If anybody knows what that is, but yeah. So yeah,

03:00.440 --> 03:04.720
in short, we've been around for quite a while and been playing with open source software,

03:04.720 --> 03:11.680
which you will hear all about today. Exactly. And we should probably say where we actually

03:11.680 --> 03:18.160
met the first time. We can do, we can do. Probably in a bar somewhere, no? Well, we did.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.800
Just prior to that, basically, I was working at a company called Redis. Redis, if you're

03:21.800 --> 03:25.920
listening, if you're watching this on the stream, the email is a sponsor at Linux Inlast on you,

03:25.920 --> 03:31.520
in case. And no, this is where we met. And Martin decided to join that no secret

03:31.520 --> 03:39.000
database company. And this is basically where we met about three years, four years ago.

03:39.000 --> 03:49.040
You're forgetting COVID on you. So we were doing technical sales at the company. And now on with

03:49.040 --> 04:01.040
the history of the podcast, it is November 2019. Yes, a rainy, cold Prague. What even was the

04:01.040 --> 04:06.440
event? The event was actually sales kickoff. Ah, yes, of course, of course. Or business review.

04:06.440 --> 04:11.920
I can't remember. Who knows, you know, some corporate nonsense. Exactly. Yes. But yes,

04:11.920 --> 04:19.840
out of that was some craft beer places visited. And where we discussed all things open source

04:19.840 --> 04:27.560
between us. Indeed. Martin was choking on hot chicken wings. And so was I. And after a few

04:27.560 --> 04:33.000
years, basically, we both discovered that yes, we were heavily into open source. And we always had

04:33.000 --> 04:38.520
this intention of doing a podcast. And then we said, why not do it together? And actually the

04:38.520 --> 04:45.320
first episode that was published in 2020 in February of 2020 actually is aptly named or the

04:45.320 --> 04:52.200
second episode is actually aptly named for them. Because where mostly I talk about 2020 for them.

04:52.200 --> 04:59.640
You went there at the time. I did. Yes. I give a presentation in the rest of room on. What is

04:59.640 --> 05:15.280
it? Okay, cool. Done. Make closer. Make closer. Yes. Okay. No, there was, yeah, there was a

05:15.280 --> 05:21.480
deaf room presentation. And then basically that was our second episode that we did. So yes, we

05:21.480 --> 05:31.000
kind of stumbled upon a format that we both like as in discuss topics like operating systems,

05:31.000 --> 05:38.640
rust, programming languages, stuff like that. And in between that, we do various interviews of

05:38.640 --> 05:45.200
people that are notable in the open source community. The format is loosely modeled on

05:45.200 --> 05:52.200
something called Floss Weekly. I don't know if that rings a bell. Twitter TV is the publisher. But

05:52.200 --> 05:57.280
they do weekly shows with just interviews. And the idea that we had at the time when we kind of

05:57.280 --> 06:04.400
originally devised the podcast to share the episodes between knowledge transfer for one

06:04.400 --> 06:16.320
or for better expression. But also livening up the whole format with actually interview guests. It

06:16.320 --> 06:23.320
took us some time to come up with the exact format. It was also loosely based on, well,

06:23.320 --> 06:30.880
as the name says, some of you may have recognized Linux Outlaws. That was a podcast a while ago

06:30.880 --> 06:41.360
that had a similar kind of format, right? Almost. Who of you knows Linux Outlaws? Ah, okay. Yeah,

06:41.360 --> 06:49.840
about 15 years ago, FAPSchafter and Dylan shared the idea of actually doing, I think,

06:49.840 --> 06:56.160
a weekly format talking just about current events. Something that we started with too.

06:56.160 --> 07:01.680
Yeah, we did that, didn't we, for a while. But it's, yeah, with the delay between publishing and

07:01.680 --> 07:07.080
talking about current events. It wasn't that relevant because the podcast came out like three

07:07.080 --> 07:13.800
months later, right? Exactly. So, yeah, go ahead, man. Yeah, well, this kind of brings us to where

07:13.800 --> 07:19.920
we started as well. Our podcast was first on Hacker Puppy Radio, which you may be familiar with as

07:19.920 --> 07:29.920
well. They have a booth. They do. Well, Ken has a booth here. Yes. Ken has a booth called Free

07:29.920 --> 07:40.080
and Culture Podcast. And this is what we use originally to bootstrap ourselves. That was

07:40.080 --> 07:45.640
actually, I spoke to Ken, I forced him in 2020, and he said, we're more than happy to bootstrap you

07:45.640 --> 07:53.880
in terms of host you to get us initially off the ground. And that's exactly what we did before we

07:53.880 --> 08:01.280
changed this, but more on this in a minute. Yeah, so for anybody thinking of doing a podcast, very

08:01.280 --> 08:09.480
easy to get started. We have an episode on this as well. We do, yes, we do. So, yeah, personally,

08:09.480 --> 08:15.120
I like the interviews. I don't know about yourself, but we have some quite very good guests in the

08:15.120 --> 08:21.880
past that we've had, which you may know as well, like the likes of recent one we had to run Levy

08:21.880 --> 08:29.840
from. Religious life. Religious life, yes. So we had various people supporting open source like the

08:29.840 --> 08:37.720
FSFE. Which is actually in the audience. In the audience, indeed. And we had various people on

08:37.720 --> 08:48.320
programming languages, operating systems. We, yes. For those of you who are now becoming interested,

08:48.320 --> 08:55.920
we do have a back catalog. The website is linusinlows.eu. For example, we had a kernel maintainer

08:55.920 --> 09:03.720
panel. We did the same with BSD, of course. Program language panel, yes. Yeah, program language

09:03.720 --> 09:08.400
panel and all the rest of it. So the idea is basically to get people on the podcast, and not

09:08.400 --> 09:15.720
just one, ideally, but more than one, and talk about projects, political issues, that sort of

09:15.720 --> 09:21.120
thing. Ah, political issues. Is there the particular episode you're thinking of from the Georgia? Yes,

09:21.120 --> 09:25.320
we have the Electronic Frontier Foundation on the podcast, but also, of course, the Free Software

09:25.320 --> 09:31.520
Foundation Europe. Yeah, it's well worth listening to that one. As is the one by Paul Ramsey,

09:31.520 --> 09:36.520
would you remember that one? Vately, remind me. I mean, we've been doing almost 80 episodes by

09:36.520 --> 09:42.880
now. Yeah, so Paul Ramsey is a push GIS maintainer. I don't know if you, those of you familiar with

09:42.880 --> 09:49.680
Postgreps will know push GIS, but he's also very much a speaker on things open source. And he

09:49.680 --> 09:56.000
kind of raises a lot of points around, you know, open source is free and available, but, you know,

09:56.000 --> 10:01.480
you get just a few people maintaining it. So there should be more funding for open source

10:01.480 --> 10:07.160
contributors in a way, but specifically in government, right? Because government uses a lot

10:07.160 --> 10:14.200
of open source software, but they're not actually contributing, and the code should be free as well,

10:14.200 --> 10:21.760
things like that. So we had a lot of discussions about this. True, yes. I think it's fair to say

10:21.760 --> 10:28.720
that we keep a, or we try to keep a well balanced middle ground between technical stuff and also

10:28.720 --> 10:33.320
political stuff. Yeah, that's a good point. Probably fair to say. But it's about raising that

10:33.320 --> 10:40.680
profile as well, right? For open source and the people that make that software is part of what

10:40.680 --> 10:45.880
we want to do. Absolutely. And this is basically why we came up with the podcast in the first place.

10:45.880 --> 10:56.080
Yep. All those years ago. Well, all three of them. So having said that, we do bi-weekly

10:56.080 --> 11:05.240
episodes, right? So it's got a busy schedule. And yeah, we alternate between a topic and an interview.

11:05.240 --> 11:12.080
Now, we should probably mention something called the dark side, Martin. The dark side. Do tell.

11:12.080 --> 11:20.680
Martin and myself, when we set out doing the podcast, we had this idea of providing a little

11:20.680 --> 11:29.080
of color to the podcast. So you've been sort of a bit of a dark color. Exactly. So who knows

11:29.080 --> 11:38.840
something called the bastard operator from hell, BUFH? Okay. Matthias, this is nothing okay for

11:38.840 --> 11:45.280
enough. No, the BUFH was, I think about a format about what, 20 years ago, maybe less, maybe

11:45.280 --> 11:53.680
more. That's where actually a system administrator talks about his trials and tribulations has

11:53.680 --> 11:59.560
put it this way. And so we took this original idea and the dark side is loosely modeled on the

11:59.560 --> 12:06.560
bastard operator from hell, but turned this into a much more comedy-oriented format that's put it

12:06.560 --> 12:13.560
this way. Yeah, for sure. It's a bit of dark humor. Let's put it that way. And yeah, these are also

12:13.560 --> 12:18.520
the only parts that are scripted in the podcast. Yes, good point. Good point. Everything is

12:18.520 --> 12:25.400
normally very ad hoc apart from that. Yeah, it's free flow. Normally, we do these dark sides, bits

12:25.400 --> 12:32.200
and pieces as part of a Halloween special, for example. Halloween, Christmas, Easter. Yes. Any

12:32.200 --> 12:42.520
other religious holiday you may want. And do you want to talk about Dutch's fladesa, maybe? Some

12:42.520 --> 12:49.080
teaser? Well, okay. So we have this, you're particularly talking about the Halloween one,

12:49.080 --> 12:55.400
right? Yes. Those of you who've heard this one, we have a yearly Halloween episode where various,

12:55.400 --> 13:04.880
we have a friend of ours who participates and does a very good, let's say, female vampire

13:04.880 --> 13:09.880
impression. Yes. If that's possible in the podcast. Yeah, actually, she's from Macedonia,

13:09.880 --> 13:21.760
right? And there, essentially, she's our voice model. She's our voice actress. And mostly,

13:21.760 --> 13:27.520
these Halloween episodes, of course, have a Halloween topic. So essentially, the episode

13:27.520 --> 13:33.160
that I was referring to, and again, we normally do these kind of around Halloween, that sort

13:33.160 --> 13:40.600
of thing, refers to the tribulations that a certain Transylvanian Duchess encounters when

13:40.600 --> 13:46.320
her workforce decides to unionize. It's that sort of black humor, and I won't give away too much.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.080
You have to listen to the episode. It's that sort of black humor that drives the dark side.

13:51.080 --> 13:57.880
In addition to kind of, and the people basically who... Slightly more serious,

13:57.880 --> 14:03.320
a subject in other episodes. And apart from the humor that is woven into the interviews,

14:03.320 --> 14:10.880
into the other sessions. Definitely, definitely. On that subject. Yes. Clearly, we make this

14:10.880 --> 14:17.000
podcast partly for ourselves because we have a bit of fun making it. True. But it's clearly

14:17.000 --> 14:26.240
aimed at listeners. So we have many ways for people to provide feedback. Yes. Carry on.

14:26.240 --> 14:31.880
The email address is, of course, FeedbackLinux.eu, but since we should probably talk about the

14:31.880 --> 14:37.440
hosting aspect, too. Yes. We publish normally on archive.org. So if you have an archive.org

14:37.440 --> 14:44.080
account, you can also leave a commonly feedback there. We do not do it Twitter for obvious reasons.

14:44.080 --> 14:53.720
Yes. No, we haven't done Twitter any time to be making of the podcast because never

14:53.720 --> 15:00.320
much of recent. We started on the on HBR for a long time, right? And only recently kind of,

15:00.320 --> 15:05.600
on other podcast media, you'd be able to find us on most of those. Yes. Of course,

15:05.600 --> 15:10.360
when we were still on Hacker Public Radio, you could leave comments on Hacker Public Radio, too.

15:10.360 --> 15:16.600
Yes. And I mean, these comments are very important to us, really. I know it's something that,

15:16.600 --> 15:22.280
yeah, more feedback we get, the more they... Exactly. I mean, yeah, the podcast is done for

15:22.280 --> 15:33.600
you listeners, not for us. Certainly not for our sponsors, because we don't have any. No. What we

15:33.600 --> 15:38.840
also do is actually, we also invite people from other podcasts on the podcast. For example,

15:38.840 --> 15:45.080
the Linux Lads, if Shane or anybody else or Conan is here, but I don't see them. Also,

15:45.080 --> 15:48.800
but we should also probably talk about the Grumpy Old Coders, right? Grumpy Old Coders,

15:48.800 --> 15:56.480
yes. Another set of podcasters that have a... Well, not a similar format, but they have... Yeah,

15:56.480 --> 16:01.840
they're more on the technical side, right? They publish less frequently. But it's again,

16:01.840 --> 16:09.520
it's some friend of ours that we occasionally have some banter with. Exactly. Yes. What else

16:09.520 --> 16:15.840
is there to talk about Linux in-laws? Well, you should listen to it. That's the main thing.

16:15.840 --> 16:27.880
Yes. Yeah. So why should you listen to the Linux in-laws, right? That's your cue. You put

16:27.880 --> 16:34.760
your spotty on. Well, why would you listen to the Linux in-laws? If you wouldn't be making it?

16:34.760 --> 16:41.240
Personally, yeah. It's mainly because we do intermix the detect stuff with a bit of fun,

16:41.240 --> 16:47.920
right? That's the main thing. And personally, I like the interview pieces generally very much,

16:47.920 --> 16:52.280
because you get so many people from different parts of the world, from different projects,

16:52.280 --> 16:57.000
and they all have clearly an open-source link, but they all have different stories to tell.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.680
And about open-source and why it's good, and they're part in it, really. Very true, yes.

17:03.680 --> 17:10.440
What about you? Well, I've been doing open-source for the last 30 plus years, so... This is why

17:10.440 --> 17:16.920
you run an Apple Mac. Indeed. But as we all know, underneath is a well-hidden BSD system, right?

17:16.920 --> 17:21.360
So no worries. Do we not have an upcoming episode on Tuxedo computers? We do,

17:21.360 --> 17:26.520
but I don't think they're listening, so it's not worth mentioning that as a sponsor. No,

17:26.520 --> 17:42.560
no worries. But no, because we touch on, I reckon, subjects that move people in terms of open-source

17:42.560 --> 17:51.840
is more and more used across industries, countries, planets. I mean, whoever has a mobile phone

17:51.840 --> 17:57.040
running Android, but also running iOS, is essentially running open-source software.

17:57.040 --> 18:03.960
Android is powered by Linux, as probably most of you know, and beneath the iOS is something

18:03.960 --> 18:14.000
called BSD, both widely used open-source operating systems. And I reckon with doing Linux in-laws,

18:14.000 --> 18:19.920
we are providing a platform for projects to voice themselves, to make themselves heard.

18:19.920 --> 18:26.040
These are not just Linux subjects, right? We also, as mentioned, touch other parts of open-source,

18:26.040 --> 18:34.320
whether it's software and hardware occasionally. And politics. Politics, yes. Society topics,

18:34.320 --> 18:40.560
and all the rest of it, yes. Yeah, not to mention, yeah. The showering situation in Germany is a

18:40.560 --> 18:47.120
common topic. Yeah, I mean, we normally reckon, we normally open with a little bit of humor. I

18:47.120 --> 18:53.680
normally slag off the United Kingdom, and Martin returns these jokes with dire descriptions

18:53.680 --> 19:01.840
of the situation in Germany. That's probably fair to say. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yes. So, yeah. If you

19:01.840 --> 19:06.080
want to, no. In short, Linux in-laws, you want to learn a little bit, you want to listen to

19:06.080 --> 19:12.160
people that have things to say about open-source, and you like a bit of fun, just come and listen

19:12.160 --> 19:19.200
to us, really. That's the... Absolutely, yeah. Well, what's our slogan, by the way? You come for

19:19.200 --> 19:26.240
the knowledge, but stay for the madness. This is something that marketing came up with before

19:26.240 --> 19:30.800
you fired them, right? Marketing? What is marketing? The department that you... Is that the people that

19:30.800 --> 19:41.920
make the t-shirts? No. So, who makes the t-shirts? The people with graphically designed capabilities

19:41.920 --> 19:47.200
I suppose. Fair enough, fair enough. No, we should talk about the logo, actually, no? You can talk

19:47.200 --> 19:51.840
about the logo, yes, yes. Oh, how many stickers have you brought, actually? Yes, you can find

19:51.840 --> 19:58.400
stickers, actually, at the Free Culture Podcast booth. Oh, you didn't have any photo listeners here?

19:58.400 --> 20:04.560
I do, yeah. Only about four or five. You find the rest, actually, at the booth. It's a prototype.

20:04.560 --> 20:10.480
Yes. So, yeah, very, very, very, very, very... Like the t-shirts. The first batch, yes. So,

20:10.480 --> 20:18.960
the logo, Martin, why did we need a new logo? Well, mainly because the previous logo was based on

20:18.960 --> 20:24.640
some pictures of us of 20 years ago. True, true, true. It's not that representative anymore.

20:25.760 --> 20:30.640
But, yeah, certain podcasts, let's say, publishers also didn't like the format, so...

20:31.280 --> 20:38.640
So, we had to change this. And after about 20,000 focus group sessions, quite a few...

20:38.640 --> 20:44.400
This is without marketing. Debates, exactly. Quite a few debates. Debates,

20:45.920 --> 20:52.960
due to various sessions, we came up with a new logo, which I hope you will find on most podcasting

20:52.960 --> 21:01.040
platforms also. By the way, yeah, although Ken is not in the audience, I think we should probably

21:01.040 --> 21:08.080
talk about metrics. Okay, go ahead. Metrics in terms of basically how many people...

21:08.080 --> 21:12.720
Well, metrics, metrics. We had done some metrics in the room today, so we could...

21:12.720 --> 21:24.560
About what? 150, maybe 108 people in the room. We host our episodes, our MP3s, on now,

21:25.200 --> 21:33.120
Ark of the Rock. And the download stats for an average one episode, just on that platform alone,

21:33.120 --> 21:43.840
clock in between 2,500 downloads per episode. But if you type Linux in-laws into your search

21:43.840 --> 21:49.360
engine of choice, you come up with a syndication left, right, and center. So it's probably...

21:49.360 --> 21:55.280
Or even your podcast app of choice, right? Yes. So it's probably fair to say that, on average,

21:55.280 --> 21:59.040
we are listened to by more than 8,000 people per episode. Give or take a few.

21:59.040 --> 22:08.000
Yes, unfortunately, they don't all feedback today. It's just a shame. Shall we interview

22:08.000 --> 22:16.160
someone in the room? Where is that listener? Where'd he go? You want to... Okay, he doesn't.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.960
Okay, fair enough. He's too shy for that. That's a shame. We should get him framed.

22:20.960 --> 22:30.160
By the way, when did you start to listen to Linux in-laws, if I may ask?

22:41.040 --> 22:47.120
Okay. Did you get that? Something about feedback. Sorry. Okay, let's talk later on this, sorry.

22:47.120 --> 22:55.280
Okay, no, we were just curious because... We get feedback at times, but the more we get,

22:55.280 --> 23:01.200
the better, obviously. Exactly, because essentially, we do the podcast for you in terms of, okay,

23:01.200 --> 23:07.200
this is our show, but we live on feedback because if you think, and that goes for anybody listening

23:07.200 --> 23:13.280
to us, if there's a subject that is of interest for you, feel free to give feedback so we can get

23:13.280 --> 23:19.760
that project on the show, talk to these politicians, whatever. And we're not kind of fixed on one

23:19.760 --> 23:26.080
particular topic, right? If you take the Ran Levy example with Manish's life, they're very much

23:26.080 --> 23:31.040
focused on security. Very true, yes. We'll do an episode on security, but we won't do a whole

23:31.040 --> 23:37.440
bit podcast on that. We'll do anything around open source. Exactly, needless to say, an open

23:37.440 --> 23:43.440
source angle would help. Yes, that would do. But at the end of the day, the Electronic

23:43.440 --> 23:50.720
Frontier Foundation is more like about civil rights. And when we did the episode with the

23:50.720 --> 23:55.680
Georgian chapter, I think one of the focus points of that interview was actually gun laws.

23:57.520 --> 24:04.160
Yes. For example. So the point that I'm making here is, yes, open source is important for us,

24:04.160 --> 24:12.000
but so are the politics and the civil rights aspects behind this whole notion, behind this whole

24:12.000 --> 24:17.360
revolution. Well, this is the part about free, isn't it, really, that we have in free and open

24:17.360 --> 24:22.400
source software that we also have talked about. Absolutely. And that's exactly the reason why

24:22.400 --> 24:29.360
we try to maintain a balance between technical and non-technical subjects. Ah, yes. And also,

24:29.360 --> 24:33.920
if you do have trouble sleeping, there is an episode on licenses, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, an open

24:33.920 --> 24:45.280
source license. But we didn't have guests on this. So yeah, it has many uses. We should probably

24:45.280 --> 24:50.800
talk about the road ahead, right? I mean, we've been doing this for the last three years now.

24:50.800 --> 25:00.000
Yeah. Where do you want to take this one? Apart from the usual world domination, making lots of

25:00.000 --> 25:08.480
money, how is yet to be determined? The objective is already kind of met, right? We're spreading the

25:08.480 --> 25:14.560
word and supporting the projects and the people that make open source. So we continue doing that,

25:14.560 --> 25:21.600
in my opinion. True, true, true. But maybe there's something more. Is there? Probably. Do tell. Some

25:21.600 --> 25:26.240
people have suggested, when we still have the focus groups, that more humor might be in order,

25:26.240 --> 25:31.600
for example, as in more dark side stuff. Okay. Well, we'll have to get some feedback on that,

25:31.600 --> 25:41.280
won't we? Indeed, indeed. Yes. What happened? I need to say, if our listeners have more ideas,

25:41.280 --> 25:45.840
the modern area. Indeed. Well, we have, I mean, the whole year is planned out pretty much, but

25:45.840 --> 25:54.320
there's always room for, of course, stuff for sure. Like today. And I mean, if you are maintaining a

25:54.320 --> 25:59.280
project that you, that you, as in you in the audience, that you would like to see feature on

25:59.280 --> 26:08.160
Linux in-laws, free to talk to us after this talk goes without saying. Yes. Now, this is exactly

26:08.160 --> 26:13.600
the point, right? If you have things that you want to be vocal about or talk about open source

26:13.600 --> 26:18.240
related, whether it's a project or your community efforts, come talk to us and we'll put you on

26:18.240 --> 26:25.520
the podcast. And with us, it's probably time for our interview guest. Oh, interview guest. Yes.

26:26.320 --> 26:32.000
We do have an interview guest. Right. Welcome. Welcome. Matias, why don't you join us on the stage?

26:32.960 --> 26:37.040
It's a little bit ahead of time, but more than Maria anyway. You'll get a bit of an

26:37.040 --> 26:42.640
appeal for how we do that episode. For those of you who do not know Matias Kirschner,

26:43.440 --> 26:49.600
why don't you introduce yourself? Yes. My name is Matias Kirschner. I'm the president of the

26:49.600 --> 26:56.480
Free Software Foundation Europe. That's my day job. And yeah, beside that, I did some volunteer

26:56.480 --> 27:06.160
activities, which is probably the topic of this interview. Absolutely. So hands up. Who does not

27:06.160 --> 27:12.000
know what the Free Software Foundation Europe does and is? So everybody knows the FSFE. You can skip

27:12.000 --> 27:18.400
that question. Fair enough. That was what she was getting at. Okay. Of course, that's also an

27:18.400 --> 27:24.320
episode from something called links and loss on the FSFE. But yes, why don't you tell us a little

27:24.320 --> 27:33.760
bit about how you came into the open source world? Put you on the spot right now. Oh, I first,

27:33.760 --> 27:42.240
the start was that I asked my father to subscribe to more newspapers so I can inform myself from

27:42.240 --> 27:49.760
more sources to see who is trying to accomplish world domination. And my father said, oh, that's

27:49.760 --> 27:56.000
too expensive. But I read something about this internet. And I will make sure that you get this,

27:56.880 --> 28:02.320
which was at that time probably more expensive and long run with the modem there. But yeah,

28:02.320 --> 28:07.360
I started with that. And then I had a second computer at home. And I tried to connect them.

28:07.360 --> 28:11.760
And I wanted to send emails to them without connecting to the internet. And it didn't work.

28:11.760 --> 28:18.080
Also, both of those computers had an email program on them. I complained at school. Someone said,

28:18.080 --> 28:23.520
I have something for you. Brought some floppies, brought some CDs. And then I installed my first

28:23.520 --> 28:31.600
GNU Linux distribution. And a few months later, I had a mail server. And from there on, then I

28:31.600 --> 28:40.880
read more about technology. I organized meetups to install parties for in the local groups,

28:40.880 --> 28:47.760
went to events. And then I read more and more about that it's also about political, social

28:47.760 --> 28:56.080
beliefs. And that's how I get interested in FSFE. Yeah, I understand the technical background,

28:56.080 --> 29:01.280
but there's clearly more to it for yourself than just the tech side with open source.

29:01.280 --> 29:08.640
I mean, at that time, I wasn't able to say, to formulate it this way. But in the end, for me,

29:08.640 --> 29:15.200
it's free software is a way to distribute power in our society. I think, I mean, democracies

29:15.200 --> 29:21.680
depend on distributing power. And we also need a distribution of technological power. And free

29:21.680 --> 29:26.800
software is an important tool for that to make sure that there is not one entity has too much

29:26.800 --> 29:31.840
power in our society. And I think that's the main part which is driving me for the work there.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.680
Very good. Very good. Did you want to take the next one?

29:35.680 --> 29:40.320
And why did you decide to join, eventually, the Free Software Foundation Europe?

29:42.560 --> 29:47.360
So at that time, then, I mean, there was, at this point, I had this political interest,

29:47.360 --> 29:50.960
I had this technical interest. I thought there are so many people on the internet,

29:50.960 --> 29:54.640
when you have questions about technical issues, you can ask. And there are so many

29:54.640 --> 29:58.880
bright people who will help you to figure it out. But about the political stuff,

29:58.880 --> 30:03.840
I was not able to figure it out myself. So I studied politics and management then.

30:04.400 --> 30:09.760
And we had to do a seven-month internship. And I asked some people, some DBM developers,

30:09.760 --> 30:16.320
I knew, where could I do that? And one of the suggestions was the FSFE. And then I read about

30:16.320 --> 30:21.200
them and applied there. And after a long or back and forth, because they didn't have

30:21.200 --> 30:26.240
interns before and didn't have an office at that time and didn't have money to pay.

30:27.120 --> 30:32.560
In the end, I ended up there in the one-room apartment of the president at that time on the

30:32.560 --> 30:37.920
sofa. He had a desk. And from there, I then worked and attended Free Software events,

30:37.920 --> 30:43.520
including my first FOSSTEM, then in 2005. Very nice. Very nice. So there's clearly,

30:43.520 --> 30:50.720
yeah. What's next after that? Is there some other will-domination plan for yourself?

30:51.840 --> 31:00.000
I think the one that is running is the topic we... I don't know what you want to say already about

31:00.000 --> 31:12.320
your next episode. Tease it away. Now is probably a good time to feature an upcoming presentation

31:12.320 --> 31:20.480
today, or reading rather? Yeah. So I will do a reading of this new book, which I wrote. It's

31:20.480 --> 31:26.000
called Ada and Sangamann, A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream. It's about

31:26.000 --> 31:32.480
encouraging people to tinker with computers. It's about software freedom in a way that is

31:32.480 --> 31:39.280
hopefully encouraging them to think on their own how they want to use technology. It will be at

31:39.280 --> 31:47.360
six o'clock now. I have to check the room again in UB 2147. And there I will do a reading of the

31:47.360 --> 31:56.400
book in 30 minutes. And afterwards, answer some questions about how to write a book with under

31:56.400 --> 32:02.240
free license. Get that published by O'Reilly for the German version and No Start Press for the

32:02.240 --> 32:08.800
English version, plus other language versions. Clearly you have an objective with the book,

32:08.800 --> 32:14.160
right? It's not just, oh, let's write a book for a bit of fun, but there is more to it than that,

32:14.160 --> 32:23.200
if I'm not mistaken. I mean, at the beginning, my main idea was how can I explain this topic

32:23.200 --> 32:29.120
to my own children? And I asked if others have some ideas about that, and if there are some

32:29.120 --> 32:36.640
existing books, and they were either for older children, or they were about a bit complicated.

32:36.640 --> 32:42.960
And then I started to tell some bedtime stories myself, always a bit improvised, and then depending

32:42.960 --> 32:52.000
on the feedback, I was then just changing the stories at that time, and then in the end, this

32:52.000 --> 32:59.360
came out of it. Is this your personal kind of initiative, or is this something that the FSF

32:59.360 --> 33:05.360
is trying to promote in terms of, you know, making awareness amongst younger people? I mean,

33:05.360 --> 33:11.840
at the beginning, it was a personal project of mine, and I was also writing this on my own time.

33:12.480 --> 33:18.160
Then at one point, I talked to someone and told him about this plan, and he said, well,

33:18.160 --> 33:25.440
if you will write a book about free software, then I will buy 1000 copies and give that to

33:25.440 --> 33:35.360
customers. And then I talked with the FSF and then I got the confirmation that I can spend

33:36.000 --> 33:42.720
a few hundred euros to get an editor on board, so that I can get someone with experience how to

33:42.720 --> 33:48.800
actually write a children's book. And yeah, when we had this, then we could also hire an illustrator

33:48.800 --> 33:55.600
to do the illustrations for the book, and get an illustrator to understand Creative Commons licensing,

33:55.600 --> 34:03.600
which is very unusual for this area, and then we were also quite lucky to get two publishers

34:03.600 --> 34:11.680
on board who also understand free licensing, and agreed to publish this as commercial publishers

34:11.680 --> 34:19.520
under CC Buy, share like. Excellent, excellent. So where can people find the book? So the

34:19.520 --> 34:32.320
German one, you brought some with you today. So this is the commercial part, or at the German

34:32.320 --> 34:38.160
version, you can already buy that everywhere. The US version, the English version, you can at the

34:38.160 --> 34:43.280
moment just get that from the US publisher, because the worldwide distribution just starts in May.

34:43.920 --> 34:51.440
So the FSFE, we got some of the books and brought them through customs, which was a pain,

34:52.240 --> 34:58.800
and we have them at the booth, and so we have a few amount of those here. And yeah,

34:58.800 --> 35:05.360
else from now on already, you can order that at every bookstore and pre-order will be shipped in

35:05.360 --> 35:11.280
May. And tonight you're doing the first, let's say, reading of the English version, right?

35:11.280 --> 35:15.840
Yeah, that was one of my wishes, that FOSSTEM will be the place where I do the first

35:15.840 --> 35:20.880
reading of the English book, and yeah, I will do that there, and for everyone else, you would like

35:21.920 --> 35:28.720
to do that. I mean, you can first try it out, and one of my recommendations is it's a really great

35:28.720 --> 35:34.640
tool to talk to children about our topics. I did several readings with the German version

35:34.640 --> 35:41.200
at schools with 30 people, 40 children, or even once in a cinema with 150 children,

35:41.920 --> 35:47.200
talking with them about that, answering their questions they have, or having some discussions

35:47.200 --> 35:52.640
about what they want to invent, how computers work, and so on. And so we have all the slides and

35:52.640 --> 35:58.640
the text and where to change slides and all kind of other information, how you can do that on our

35:58.640 --> 36:05.040
git repository, it's all freely licensed, you can make changes to it, let's see what's coming out,

36:05.840 --> 36:12.400
you can make a sequel. Yeah, it's, I think that's something we will also discuss in the show,

36:13.280 --> 36:20.400
probably a tool for world domination. And for those of you who cannot make it at 6 p.m.,

36:20.960 --> 36:25.200
there will be a reading on something called Linux Inlass in an upcoming episode, more than

36:25.200 --> 36:31.920
likely in April. So if you missed this reading tonight, feel free to tune in or download that

36:31.920 --> 36:40.720
particular episode. Okay. Anything else we should discuss with the president while we have him on

36:40.720 --> 36:49.200
the stage, Martin? I think we still have some minutes left. No, I think we have some minutes

36:49.200 --> 36:54.000
left. So I mean, I think the subject has been beaten to death, but anywhere I would like still

36:54.000 --> 37:02.800
to have your opinion on this. Richard M. Salman, just two sentences on this, just to wake up the

37:02.800 --> 37:10.080
audience once again. I mean, it's history for enough, but it's been a while, but I think he has

37:10.800 --> 37:15.040
made a rebound in terms of he's back on the board now, right, of the Free Software Fund. I know that

37:15.040 --> 37:23.200
the FSFE issues a statement after the Holy Barclay, but I reckon he's back on track now at least

37:23.200 --> 37:31.200
in the U.S., no? I mean, any views on this that you would like to share? Oh, that's very complicated.

37:31.200 --> 37:37.920
Okay. And we still have, I think, 10 minutes left. The abridged version.

37:39.200 --> 37:47.920
Yeah. Now I was cornered here on this topic. Now, I think that's a really complicated

37:47.920 --> 37:54.320
discussion, and it's also a discussion which, at the moment, I also prefer to have some

37:54.320 --> 38:03.120
personal conversations with other people involved in this before this is going public. So I'm sorry,

38:03.120 --> 38:09.520
but this is a bit too difficult to discuss. Very diplomatic answer. Back to much more

38:09.520 --> 38:12.960
safer grounds. Where do you see the Free Software Foundation Europe going?

38:12.960 --> 38:24.080
I mean, what I see is that the topics are going more and more mainstream, and so

38:25.360 --> 38:33.840
one of the big challenges there is how can we make sure that this topic doesn't stay at

38:33.840 --> 38:40.160
FOSTA and at some Free Software conferences, but that we are going to other conferences

38:40.160 --> 38:48.080
and connect with other topics which are ongoing and which are very much influenced by our topics

38:48.080 --> 38:53.120
that we are usually discussing here. So when we talk about, there are discussions in the

38:53.120 --> 39:00.640
sustainability area, which when you, there's a huge dependency on can you really make changes

39:00.640 --> 39:11.360
to hardware, software, and how is technology developed? There are questions about who should

39:11.360 --> 39:17.680
have control over the computers. Like, I mean, we have net neutrality. On the other hand,

39:17.680 --> 39:21.840
it's very important that we also have device neutrality so that every one of us has the right

39:21.840 --> 39:28.160
to install or remove software on our devices, that we can change web browsers, that we can change

39:28.160 --> 39:34.000
app stores, that we can change the services which are connected to our devices, and that's

39:34.000 --> 39:41.440
something which is, I mean, at the time when the movement started, it was small and we had some

39:41.440 --> 39:46.240
desktop machines and some laptops, and now we have the computers everywhere, and now, I mean,

39:46.240 --> 39:51.680
there are so many people who have questions about this topic, so it's more and more important to

39:51.680 --> 39:57.440
translate this to a more general audience, people who don't have such a knowledge about

39:57.440 --> 40:05.360
technology, and that's something which was, the FSFE always was doing this, but that's

40:05.360 --> 40:11.680
something where we have more and more demand about that, and it's now not anymore that you

40:11.680 --> 40:16.320
want to talk with people about free software, and most of them say, oh, I'm not interested,

40:16.320 --> 40:22.480
it's now more the problem that there are so many people who have questions about that, and we just

40:22.480 --> 40:28.960
have a limited amount of resources, so the important thing is how can we enable more people,

40:28.960 --> 40:35.040
more volunteers to also work on these topics, that's also why, with this book, I mean, I'm

40:35.040 --> 40:40.640
invited to do a lot of readings at schools, but I will not be able to fulfill this, that the demand

40:40.640 --> 40:46.720
there, so we need to enable others to also do that and do this, and that's also for the,

40:46.720 --> 40:55.440
for all the other topics, with device neutrality, with sustainability, with public money, public

40:55.440 --> 41:01.520
code, one of the campaigns we are running, where there are so many governments which are interested,

41:01.520 --> 41:06.400
and public administrations that are interested, yes, I'm totally convinced, but how do I do that,

41:06.960 --> 41:13.760
and so that's one of the big challenges there, how do we enable that, and I mean, during the last

41:13.760 --> 41:19.760
three years, it was very difficult to motivate volunteers to get in contact with new volunteers,

41:19.760 --> 41:26.080
that's why something like FOSTA now is very important there, I mean, public money, public

41:26.080 --> 41:31.200
code was the first campaign where I came across the FSFV all those years back, at the moment,

41:31.200 --> 41:35.760
you're running a sustainability campaign in the era of mobile devices, if I recall correctly,

41:36.320 --> 41:43.280
that was upcycling Android, where we help people to install other ROMs, other operating systems

41:43.280 --> 41:48.720
on their mobile devices and also explain people that it's important that you can install or

41:48.720 --> 41:55.760
remove software from devices and repair devices, so that's one other area. Okay, and would you go

41:55.760 --> 42:01.840
as far as kind of associating these campaigns with the right to repair that you all, that you

42:01.840 --> 42:06.800
almost touched upon a minute ago? Yeah, I mean, the right to repair is definitely one part of this

42:06.800 --> 42:16.320
whole device neutrality area. Any future campaigns that you want to tease now? I mean, there are

42:16.320 --> 42:22.080
several things that will come up, but one thing that for me is very important at this time of the

42:22.080 --> 42:28.080
year, so it's February, and on the 14th of February, we are always running the iLoveFree

42:28.080 --> 42:34.480
software day, the idea at that time was I thought that the flower industry is benefiting so much

42:34.480 --> 42:40.480
from this day. Why can't we have something where the free software community is benefiting from this?

42:43.040 --> 42:51.680
Yeah, so and I think in our community, we give each other very open feedback, very direct feedback,

42:51.680 --> 42:58.080
but sometimes we forget to say thank you to all those amazing people here at the conference who

42:58.080 --> 43:04.080
help others with their knowledge, who share their software with others, and so at the 14th of February,

43:04.080 --> 43:09.440
we always encourage everyone out there to thank other free software contributors out there,

43:10.240 --> 43:16.240
buy them a beverage, send them a letter or a postcard, or I mean, just in general, say thank

43:16.240 --> 43:21.680
you to them, because it's something which in the end, I mean, all of those people, they are doing

43:21.680 --> 43:28.960
such a great job, such an important contribution to our society, which we often forget about,

43:28.960 --> 43:35.120
and so do this on the 14th of February, add it to your calendar, and the next day you can continue

43:35.120 --> 43:40.160
to write feature requests, bug reports, complain why this programming language is used and not the

43:40.160 --> 43:47.840
other, and why this approach is bad and yours is better, but yeah, don't forget to say thank you

43:47.840 --> 43:54.080
once a year, at least. Also, there are, at least in Germany, there are a couple of events taking

43:54.080 --> 44:00.480
place, for example, one of the Frankfurt user groups, I think it's even the CCC, as in the

44:00.480 --> 44:08.480
KS computer club, has an event at the headquarters celebrating this free software day, so if you

44:08.480 --> 44:15.200
want to take part in this, check out, is it on the website? So yeah, on the website fsv.org,

44:15.200 --> 44:21.360
in the news section, you find an entry there about I Love Free Software Day, and several local

44:21.360 --> 44:26.560
groups are also organizing events, where we are inviting free software contributors, make sure

44:26.560 --> 44:30.960
that there are some pizzas, some cake, and there are people who can thank the others. We have,

44:31.680 --> 44:38.080
in Berlin, also, at Seabase Hacker Space, we have a DJ there, we have an event in Crees,

44:38.080 --> 44:43.920
we have an event in Frankfurt, and there are others there, and if you want to organize that on

44:43.920 --> 44:48.800
your, something like that, on your own, let us know, so we can also list your I Love Free Software

44:48.800 --> 44:55.680
Day event, it's an event where we hope that many of you here, many of the people visiting for

44:55.680 --> 45:00.800
them, will receive a thank you for your work, and well, if you want to organize something there,

45:00.800 --> 45:08.800
let us know. We can also help you a bit when you register there, that we could cover like the pizza

45:08.800 --> 45:14.720
for this event or so, and just write us an email, and we will see that we can also financially

45:14.720 --> 45:22.480
support when you want to organize that, so that, because we think that if every euro that is invested

45:22.480 --> 45:28.560
in such a nice event, and some nice cake there, that this will benefit Free Software in the long

45:28.560 --> 45:35.040
run a lot, because it's so motivating to receive, yeah, some appreciation for your work.

45:35.040 --> 45:39.840
Sounds like a bit like the dark side, really, we have cookies, don't we, cake in this case.

45:39.840 --> 45:44.240
So people, this has been almost a live session of something called Linux in-laws,

45:44.240 --> 45:49.600
this is the format that we normally do every, every, every month, as in bringing guests on stage,

45:49.600 --> 45:55.760
putting him or her on the spot, and then having a little bit of fun. If you like this, the feed

45:55.760 --> 46:02.320
address is on the, is on the, is on the screen, I think we have time for one more question

46:02.320 --> 46:10.320
from the audience. Is there any question that you would like to get answered right now,

46:10.960 --> 46:14.960
preferably from a foster, from a, from a free and open-source software background?

46:17.600 --> 46:23.280
If there isn't, thank you very much for listening, I'm tempted to say,

46:24.480 --> 46:30.400
there will be a session tonight, as in you can ask us anything, you also find the address on

46:30.400 --> 46:35.760
the website, it's just a little bit of fun. At that pub, we're going to start at about 8.30,

46:37.440 --> 46:43.680
the place isn't too big, so just make sure that you are there on time in order to,

46:43.680 --> 46:48.560
to avoid, to avoid disappointment if you can't get in. So 8.30 at that address,

46:48.560 --> 46:53.200
you also find this on Linux in-laws, you just click on the foster tab. Thank you very much.

46:53.200 --> 47:02.720
Thank you very much. Thank you.
