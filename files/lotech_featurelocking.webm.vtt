Hello, I'm not Pranam, but Pranam couldn't be here because of all these visa problems

00:14.760 --> 00:16.080
and things like this.

00:16.080 --> 00:25.600
So I will be speaking on his behalf and plus I also work with him on this section so I

00:25.600 --> 00:26.600
think it's okay.

00:26.600 --> 00:33.600
Okay, so I'm Pedro by the way, Pedro Silva, so I'm now talking on behalf of Pranam.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.760
So what is feature restrictions and feature locking?

00:37.760 --> 00:46.320
It was a section developed by Pranam within Collab Online and the main goal here was to

00:46.320 --> 00:53.040
add an additional lever, an additional option to any CIS admin.

00:53.040 --> 01:02.400
So basically it's a switcher or perhaps better described as a set of switchers that allow

01:02.400 --> 01:06.680
CIS admin to hide a set of features.

01:06.680 --> 01:15.040
Maybe you want to restrict the usage of your resources or maybe other options.

01:15.040 --> 01:22.440
Maybe you just want to avoid the users to use, I don't know, formatting a cell or something

01:22.440 --> 01:23.440
like this.

01:23.440 --> 01:30.360
There is a lot of these use cases that you can have for hiding those features, which

01:30.360 --> 01:31.360
is useful.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.080
So it's always this on, off, straight forward switcher.

01:36.080 --> 01:42.080
But what if you do not want to hide completely the feature, you just want to lock it.

01:42.080 --> 01:48.080
So imagine, I don't know, again a CIS admin, a hoster, an integrator, might have higher

01:48.080 --> 01:58.240
ceiling, but that higher ceiling for system resources, they need to be maybe either paid

01:58.240 --> 02:06.720
by the user, but still they want to offer this initial, I don't know, initial, this

02:06.720 --> 02:16.440
hostage that they normally have packaged with completely gratis set of softwares.

02:16.440 --> 02:23.720
And this is where feature locking enters in, so as it says here, it basically adds this

02:23.720 --> 02:33.560
lock icon and then the user imaginary case scenario as a hosting, the user has a free

02:33.560 --> 02:42.040
hosting plan or something like this and does as limit of system resources usage.

02:42.040 --> 02:51.720
But then after clicks that icon, any of these locked icons sees a pop up to start to have

02:51.720 --> 02:55.080
a proper hosting account.

02:55.080 --> 03:00.520
So there's a lot of interesting use cases here.

03:00.520 --> 03:04.840
But how this is done, so that's the interesting part I would say.

03:04.840 --> 03:13.600
So there is these two key words, this is user locked and is user restrict.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.720
And they are just, again, as I said, switchers, so on, off, through, false.

03:18.720 --> 03:28.280
And this can be set in the cool WSTXML, so it's very easy, just open cool WSTXML, you

03:28.280 --> 03:34.560
can even do it locally, you can try it, you can even lock it and then call your, I don't

03:34.560 --> 03:39.840
know, brother or cousin that normally screws up all the formatting and tell him try to now

03:39.840 --> 03:43.720
screw up and he cannot because all those formatting options are here.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.400
So it's very interesting a joke to do.

03:47.400 --> 03:54.880
And how this looks like, yeah, so this is an example, you see, he cannot mark any text

03:54.880 --> 04:03.800
bold, even if he tries very hard, so it's an example or he can, but you see the italic

04:03.800 --> 04:06.040
option disappears.

04:06.040 --> 04:14.360
See the difference between restricted and locked, these cool WST options stated here.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.960
So I think it's pretty much it.

04:17.960 --> 04:35.000
Thanks for having me for the presentation.
