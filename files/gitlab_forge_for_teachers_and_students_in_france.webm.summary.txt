Alexis Kaufman presented a forge project for teachers and K-12 students in France which allows them to collaboratively create educational content. The project is supported by the French state and distinguishes itself from other forges in that it prioritizes pedagogical content over code and is specifically aimed at K-12 teachers and students. The project has already been approved by the French Ministry of Education and is powered by a GitLab instance administered by the Association of Computer Science Teachers of France. The main challenge of the project is to convince more teachers and students to use it and to provide support, training, and promotion for the projects submitted. Kaufman hopes to discuss the project with other European ministries of education to share experiences.
