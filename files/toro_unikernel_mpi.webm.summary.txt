In this talk, Matthias discussed the concept of Toro Unicolonial, a method of deploying user applications in a way that is closer to the hardware with less interference from the operating system. He discussed the three building blocks of Toro: memory per core, a cooperative scheduler, and core-to-core communication based on the built IEA. He went on to explain the process of deploying MPI applications on Toro and provided a benchmark of his implementation.
