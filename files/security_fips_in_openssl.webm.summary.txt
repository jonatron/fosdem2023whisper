In this talk given at the FOSDEM conference in 2023, Dimitri Beliapsky discussed the FIPS certification process and the changes made to the OpenSSL 3.0 architecture in order to meet FIPS 140-3 standards. He also explained the importance of the FIPS certification for the usage of software in many American government institutes and for big customers. He concluded by discussing their changes such as the implementation of implicit and explicit indicators, the removal of algorithms such as AdWords curves and triple-des, changes to key derivation functions, and how downstream patches are used to improve backwards compatibility.
