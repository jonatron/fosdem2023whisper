Summary: In this talk, Max discussed how he created a documentation framework for the Sovereign Cloud Stack to enable a unified standard between many different vendors. The documentation framework uses a combination of three custom GitHub Actions Workflows to copy, mark, down folders and files from many sources, build them into a single-page application which is then deployed to a static server. The end result is the Sovereign Cloud Stack documentation page on docs.scs.community. The talk also briefly discussed support for other documentation formats and solutions for versioning.
