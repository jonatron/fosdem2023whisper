The talk is about testing Jetpack Compose UI on Android. The speaker explains the differences between testing regular views and testing composables in Compose. They provide examples of composables and explain how to write tests for them using the Compose testing framework. The speaker also discusses the Semantics tree and how it can be used to assert on the behavior of composables. They demonstrate different testing APIs and techniques, such as finding nodes in the Semantics tree, performing actions on nodes, and visualizing the Semantics tree for better understanding. The talk also covers hybrid UI testing, which involves including Compose content in regular views or vice versa. The speaker showcases examples of including regular views in Compose and Compose content in regular views and explains how to test these scenarios using Compose and Espresso together. The speaker concludes by providing additional resources for more in-depth information on Compose testing.
