{"text": " So, welcome to the second talk of today in the sovereign cloud death room. And I'm very happy that Peter, founder of Pacona, is with us. And this is now your stage, Peter. Welcome. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, one. That's fantastic. Okay. Well. So, we're going to talk today about wonderful topic of open source and its relationship with the cloud. Now, I think most of you don't know me. And I thought I would highlight my perspective first, right? So you can understand maybe where I'm coming from better. Myself, I was involved in open source since late nineties, which now seems like a long time ago. I was at that time building my first startup back in Russia. And I took unconventional decision to use open source rather than stealing property software, which was, you know, the most conventional thing to do, right? In Russia in late nineties, afterwards, I joined my school AV before Oracle, before Sunmet. That was like a tiny company about 40 people and that's where I got a lot exposure in building and sort of promoting the open source. And I also was their founder and until recently CEO of the company, which specializes in open source databases, right? And we release all our software as open source. And since that time, I was also involved as advisor, mentor, investor in some case and various, you know, companies around open source, open source space, right? If you want to summarize all that kind of presentation, a couple of words is, would it probably this, right? I believe that everything being equal, open source is a better choice, right? Of course, you tell me it's never everything equal, but then I think this second thing applies, right? I think as a member of community, employee, right, manager of a company, it is always better for you long term to invest your time, invest your resources into the open source rather than just send that to some, you know, proprietary vendor, right, which will provide more value to them than to you. Now one thing to understand about open source is that the open source takes time. This is a slide I shamelessly stole from, talk from Bruce with this last name nobody can pronounce, so I won't ever try it, right? But this is the Bruce in PostgreSQL community, right, who often talks about PostgreSQL and open source and he uses this chart which says, hey, you know what, if you look at compared to the proprietary software, open source tend to take a longer time, right? Because if you think about saying, hey, you know what, I get one kind of, you know, get a small team together, you know, fund them and say, hey, build this, we can do it faster compared to open source, which is kind of a lot more organic fluid, a lot more discussions, you know, a lot more, you know, people operating maybe on a volunteer basis, each takes time, but then over time, it overtakes the proprietary software according to many criteria in many areas. And as example, which I would use is this, like Linux and Celerius. When I was getting started with open source, I have a lot of friends which were running real Unix operating system, you know, Celerius, HPX, AIX, anybody remember those, right? And they would think like, well, Linux, that is a toy, right? That's like a 32-bit operating system at the time, doesn't handle, you know, multiple CPUs well. You could not even at the time have a file more than two gigabytes in size, right? I mean, you know, like sounds like a joke, right? And rightfully so, but where are we here now, right? I mean, how many of you are guys still running HPX, anyone? Or like AIX, Celerius probably, maybe there should be one or two people, no? No Celerius folks? Well, we can see what over time, Linux, if it's kind of slow and messy at times, development progress, right, really overtook that there are other operating systems, right? Especially if you look at the server side, right, then Linux is well dominating. And we can also look, if you look at the cloud, we can see another comparison here, right? I remember also back in those early nineties, where folks would be using, you know, ASP.net with Windows stacks and wow, it is so fantastic if you graphical user interfaces, wherever, compared to us open source folks who would be coding, you know, PHP or Perl in VI, right? Or Emacs, right, if you are from the other camp, right, in that time, right? Which was very different, right? But if you look at how things developed right now, now we have a fantastic development frameworks, right, very efficient for many open source frameworks, right, that things evolve. Now, at the same time, if you look at the cloud standpoint, we are kind of in a similar situation. You can even go to this kind of very polished, integrated, yada yada, but very proprietary stacks, which Amazon or many other proprietary huge cloud vendors are ready to provide you, right? Or you can have open source solutions which are not yet as polished, powerful, integrated. And so on and so forth, right? But I believe, well, they are going to get there. Now, what I want at this point to talk a little bit more about where we are now in kind of a state of the ecosystem, what is happening and what the trends are. One, if you think about relationship with clouds and open source, you can say, well, from one side, the cloud vendors have been making the open source a lot easier for other people, right? I mean, if you look at deploying some open source technology, especially it applies, I would say, to the databases, it's much easier to get, let's say, Postgres running in a cloud vendor compared to getting your kind of well, you know, highly available, monitor backup for a PostgreSQL cluster on virtual machines, right? But on the other hand, we can also see all those cloud vendors use this kind of an old strategy, which actually they used even before the cloud, which is called embrace, extend, extinguish, right? And what that means is, hey, you know, why don't we take the open source? We make it fancier. Fancy may mean more features, like in a database space, well, where I come from, would be something like Amazon Aurora. It's wonderful, there are those kind of additional features, very performance, wherever. Or maybe more usable, maybe there's like a fancy GUI, so you can deploy it with a couple of clicks, right, instead of have to put some elbow grease, right, to do it the open source way. But then, yes, you go there and you kind of check in in a hotel, California, right? Which if you know the song, you can't really ever leave, leave again, right? Now, what I think in this case, it's important to understand, and for all of us as open source developers to recognize what really the usability and ease of view is increasingly becoming, that is a new frontier of the competition, right? And I think that is especially hard for people for my generation, which got used to that very kind of hairy open source, right? At that time, we remember, you know, compiling open source from source, right? And kind of, we have all that skills, right? But if you think what is happening right now in a software industry, in general, as well in open source is this. One is a software just, you know, absolutely explodes in amount, right? Everything is software those days, right? Amount of software which is being written will need to be written, need to be maintained, and so on and so forth is, you know, absolutely amazing and growing every year. The same happens with data, right? We have more and more data and more and more ways to process and whatever that data for good and for evil, right? But at the same time, we are, have to do that with less, especially with skills, right? You can see as a software engineer in, right, in technology industries of all, we have a lot of people getting in that stuff, which are not going to really be able to debug Linux kernel code, right? You know, have some, you know, just obvious basic skills, right? Well, for them, you need to build a software which is, which is, which is easier to use. The fact, I think, what is very interesting is what we can see increasingly some expert, even in related to open source technologies, which actually only have cloud specific skills, right? Well, especially in the US, right, where I think adoption of a cloud is substantially for a loan, right? You may have somebody saying, look, you know, I am, you know, PostgreSQL expert, right? And you talk to them, what that means? He is very capable of provisioning, you know, PostgreSQL Aurora on AWS with two clicks, right? But you say, like, well, you know what, what is patronage? Yes, like, what, what? Well, that's like some high-vivity solution for Postgres, right, if you guys don't know, right? Which is, which is very basic, well. I think another interesting thing is what, especially in the large corporations standpoint, a lot of them run to build their businesses by, by the book, right? So if a management made a choice, what we are adopting, let's say, Amazon cloud or Google cloud, Azure doesn't matter. They often then would come to them and say, OK, how do we do that? Give us the book, right? And what are those cloud vendors going to tell? Oh, they're not going to, to tell you, well, you know, to use our basic services which you find in the other cloud. They are going to tell you to use where the most property, advanced, you know, managed solution, right? If you read what Amazon will say, hey, you know, go use DynamoDB, right? It's awesome, right? Or it's Amazon Aurora, Redshift, all that kind of stuff, which, which makes you the most sticky for the cloud and which is also providing the most margin to, to those folks, right? So what is also interesting in this case, right? If you look for Amazon Aurora, for example, as they see their customers getting more and more locked in, the price differential between their, your computer sources, right? You know, storage, right? And essentially, like another software, it becoming larger and larger, right? If every new generation of CPU can actually, you know, I find that excuses, right? So, I find that changes. So what, so that means it becomes more and more expensive over time, right? And also, you will see in this environment also really embracing scaling by the credit card, right? Because scaling is, is easy, right? You don't have to figure out how to run the, that server you have because getting the next one would, bigger one would take three months, right? Even if you get a budget approved, right? Like we used to have like 10, 15 years ago. Now, you know, screw that optimization skills, right? You can just go to the larger instance size, right? And that's, that's easy. And again, like from what we see from a database standpoint, a lot of databases in the cloud are optimized very poorly exactly because of that trend. Now, what is interesting for me also is how that plays with their venture funded open source, which is a lot of open source those days, of course, right? And what we can see is what they are really, well, protesting against unfair competition from a cloud vendors, yada, yada, right? And many of them abandon open source licenses, right? And go to, to something else, right? Which is, well, really shifting to a proprietary, proprietary software, software models. Now, this is, in my opinion, is very different from a community driven open source, right? If you think about, well, compare something like PostgreSQL to Mongo, right? Which I think is the, in the, in the database space are very opposites from on that kind of open source embracement specter, right? The PostgreSQL really has benefited a lot from, from a cloud, from adoption standpoint, right? Because cloud made PostgreSQL much easier for, for a lot of, a lot of people, right? But at the same time, of course, now there are different players which dominate the ecosystem. Yes, it used to be enterprise DB was the biggest dog, right? Well, now it is probably Amazon, right? And other cloud vendors make more money and they are, but you know what? They are hiring a lot of PostgreSQL engineers and investing a lot still to make a PostgreSQL better. So, at large extent, PostgreSQL community still benefits in this regard. What also have been interesting for me in the last decade or so is the idea of a growth at any cost, right? For a lot of companies, you can find, well, at least in the US stock market, you know, the more money company is losing, the better its valuation, right? As long as you can grow a user base, base as well, right? And in this case, you really gravitated saying, how can I grow faster? That means focus my resources and, and cloud, which often allows you to, well, things simple, no, expensive, right, was very much adopted, right? And for those companies often didn't make sense to invest in efficiency, which I think open source often brings ease, right? Even though it requires a little bit more investment and elbow grease kind of and management attention to make those things happen. Even more, though, you can see the cloud has been quite good at giving you your first shot of heroin for free, right? You can find what every cloud or person, hey, oh, your startup, great, will give you some, you know, big chunk of money so you can spend, spend on us, right? Or giving the free tea, right, and whatever, whatever solution. Well, but I guess with this analogy, you understand, right? Well, what if somebody giving you a first shot of heroin for free, they may not always have your best interest in mind, right? Now, I think what is interesting is what there are some revelations which are, which are coming, right? I think in this case and things are changing. And I will provide a bunch of like links to the detailed articles here, right, which you guys can check when you saw the cloud. Like this is interesting from this, you know, trillion-dollar paradox, right, which talks about, well, you know what, cloud is damn expensive. And for many cloud companies, the very large portion of their cost of revenues actually cloud spent, right? So if you are choosing to go with that cloud, especially kind of most expensive versions on that, well, you know what, you have to be giving up on a lot of potential, potential profit margin. Recently, you may also heard this 37 signals which talk about while they are leaving the cloud and they detailed that stuff. That is also like a very influential company, right? It's not very good, very big dollar amounts, right, compared to enterprise here. But I think it's very nice what they kind of went public in this case and say, hey guys, even in our scale, even if you spend in maybe, you know, like a less than 10 million dollars, right, a year on the cloud, it makes sense, right, to actually do things differently, right? And 10 million dollars may sounds like a lot of money to some of you, but if you look at even kind of like a mid-size and, well, especially more like logic operations, they often spend hundreds of millions on dollars on the cloud spent. Now, another trend which I think is interesting, which is coming out, I think is GitOps and generally the approaches where we have declarative versioned infrastructure as a code approach, right? Because when you do that, then often those kind of fancy GUI point and click I can do in the cloud is not exactly how you do things anymore, right? That's where you kind of sort of do it more of a, well, through, you know, API, you know, command line, if you will, right, things there. Open source tooling is already better. Hybrid cloud is another interesting trend, right? And what I want you to see from this graph is what if you look at the larger the corporation is, the more of them are embracing the hybrid cloud, right? That's from the CNCF poll, right? And if you are using public, if you're using hybrid clouds, multiple cloud vendors, you know, public and private cloud together, then you probably do not want to rely too much on those, you know, proprietary services, right? Because they tend not to be as portable. In the end, I think what you are, what we're seeing the open source kind of catches up again, leaving us with kind of two choices here. If you look at the AWS, which is obviously the biggest dog, where you can replace that with, you know, Azure, GCP, right? Or, you know, some other major cloud, you can really lock in the approach of a cloud vendor, right? Or you can use their cloud native foundation stack, right? Among others, right there, you are really treating cloud as a commodity and building the value through their open source software. What I think is interesting from a cloud native environment is how big it is, right? You guys probably cannot even see all the logos, right, on the slide, right? There is a lot out there. There is typically more than one solutions for even for a single problem, right? And some of you say, hey, that is too much, but that is also the open source way, right? In many cases, we need in open source multiple solutions to the same problems, right, which will kind of evolve, right? And maybe some of you will die off, I will join forces together, and that is how great stuff happens, right? But I wanted to show that just to illustrate how much momentum there is behind their open source approach. Now, I think in this case, what that allows us is to really, given their proprietary cloud, it's originally attended role of commodity infrastructure. Why am I saying originally intended role? Well, you can see this, this is actually the slide I took from some very old AWS presentation. Then they're just bringing the cloud to the masses and say, hey, guys, you know what? You don't usually run your own generator, right, at home. It's not convenient. Well, yes, in some cases, it makes sense, but mostly you buy electricity. So you should buy the same from a cloud when it comes to computer resources, storage, yada, yada. It will make sense. But here is a key difference, right? If you buy the electricity, it is commodity. You can buy the electricity from, you know, a variety of vendors or make your own, right, and you see all appliances going to work, right? You don't have to change your TV or your fridge, right, if you're doing the other electricity, right? Well, and that is kind of what a lot of cloud vendors want us to do, right? Well, we'll provide you commodity thing, right, electricity, but you know what we also really want you to use those appliances which will only work with our kind of electricity. Well, that sounds like bullshit to me. So with this, I think we have really two choices, right, how we can approach those, you know, the cloud, which I will call as a cloud of surfroom and counter-freedom. One is to use a lot of proprietary features of your cloud vendors, sell your soul to the devil, right, and all the other stuff, right? So let's vote. How many one is going to use that way? Any hands out there? No? I would accept there's some, you know, people working for Amazon here or something. I was saying, yeah, yes, yes, okay. And then we can use cloud of freedom, which is saying, well, cloud vendors are fine. It's like a good commodity infrastructure providers, like the internet providers, right? Just give us those commodity resources and we will build the rest of the stuff using open source. How many of you think that is a good idea? Okay, okay, that's better. Okay, now in this regard, what I think is a very good API in this regard? Well, it is the Kubernetes, right? I would not say that Kubernetes is absolutely perfect. It's not, but I think what every successful open source project started as a piece of crap, right? I mean, it's just how things go, right? Because you build successful open source projects not having a solid technical foundation despite what engineers want to believe, but building the movement, building the ecosystem, right? And then those ecosystems, right? Well, is able to redo the code, right? Mistakes wherever and to build something, right? With Kubernetes example, I remember there was messes. Anybody remember messes? Well, that was a very cool project, right? I remember talking to those goals and they have, let's say, five years ago a lot of very cool things which Kubernetes did not have, but you know what? They lost adoption game. And now you can see the things like I have next, oh, no, sorry, next, their container storage interface and some other stuff. Hey, you know what? Kubernetes is getting a lot better for data intensive applications, right? Not just for this narrow use case of a stateless applications, it was originally designed. We also now have either the data on Kubernetes community, right? Which is a special community which is focused on running data intensive applications on Kubernetes, right? And what is interesting in this case from also the CNCF survey, we can actually see what from 2001 to 2002 were the databases, right? So something which technically was not something you would ever think to run on Kubernetes five years ago is one of the fastest growing application type which is being run on Kubernetes those days. Now, I would say even more, what we see right now is if you look at a lot of modern independent database as a service provider, right? All of those folks, they are actually using Kubernetes on the back and to build their database as a service solution. You may not know that, you may not care, but they are doing that and that means for them, well, that is both efficient way to build it, operate it and that can be run stable enough, like at least with a good skill. Another interesting result what's going on with Kubernetes is what we are having, despite having Kubernetes already quite ubiquitous, right? Hey, you can run it on pretty much any cloud. If you look at many, you know, every distribution, Linux distribution now have their own Kubernetes disk, right? At least the major one, right? You see the Kubernetes from VMware, right? And, you know, many other solutions right now, right? But we are also having the Kubernetes come into other places, like I like this K3S solution, which is lightweight Kubernetes, right? Which you can deploy on the age IoT devices, right? Or, you know, if you just have, you know, a couple of servers in your basement that you want to run Kubernetes on. We also are getting more solutions for visual kids, right? Because if you look at, you know, like a raw Kubernetes, you often would be seeing that, you know, console and YAML files, right? Right and everything. But now we are also have a pretty good dashboard which comes with Kubernetes as a project and as well integrations with applications. Like, there are solutions like CubeApps or Rancher application catalog, right? We can say, hey, you know, if I'm running Kubernetes, I can deploy open source and the appropriate applications on my Kubernetes solution in a couple of clicks. Kind of similar to what we see now in their major, major clouds, right? Where we have their marketplaces. Okay, so with that, where do I think things need to be going and will be going next as we are getting more and more open source software in a cloud? One, we still need to continue working on the better integration. Because I think that is the name of the game right now, right? We expect really all the software and the software and hardware to be very well integrated with each other, right? And that is something where I think a lot of property vendors put a lot of folks in, right? Because if it's not easy to make two things work together, then for majority of the people, it would not be accessible. Because remember what we spoke about? A lot of people do not have very advanced skills those days. Related thing, of course, is the better usability, right? I mean, we have expectations of usability very high. Attention span, very low, right? I mean, I'm not sure. Any of you have like teenage kids? Or am I just too old here? What do you think about the attention span those days? Okay, well, and remember, right? Those teenagers are probably already doing some work with computers, right? It's often thought as a middle school those days, some programming skills, right? And they will be going in the industry in the next few years. And the last thing I would mention, and that again maybe comes from my database background, right? Is making sure we also have a good experience if at day two operations, not just day one. In very many cases, I see there is a lot of application catalogues and where we say, hey, look at that, you can develop an application very quickly. But then if you really want to maintain that, it's like, you know, with database, you can't just tear it apart and deploy the new one. Well, that is something which can become instantly quite complicated, right, if it's not handled well. Well, with that, I will end with my call to action with pretty much saying what I started, right? I would encourage you to embrace the open source in the cloud, also invests, both in terms of your personal time and efforts and as well, motivating your company to invest in making it better. Because open source very much depends on our collective effort, right, for its success. And of course, spread the world, that is how the movement grows. Well, with that, it's all ahead and I would be happy to answer some questions. APPLAUSE Thank you very much for your talk. You said in your final slide that people should be investing in open source and invest in making it better. What are your thoughts on the new kind of trend you see of organisations like the Sovereign Tech Fund in Germany, allocating millions to open source projects and things like that? Where do you think the money should come from? Or is there a structured way it should actually be allocated? Well, so where should money come from, right, from open source? Well, look, I think there is a variety of things, right? I think if you look in this case like from the government standpoint, right, it's classically have been supporting, you know, public good with investment in research, right, the medicine, right, wherever. Like, I think the open source is one of such ways how you can create a lot of public good, right, which is wonderful. I think though, in many cases, probably the majority can come from, right, who are the public corporations, I don't know, probably private corporations, right, acting out of their own interests, right. I think in this case, we all need to also work with that kind of like mentality change, right, because you see like for years, right, even before like a Microsoft changed it and became like all, you know, we love open source kind of company, right. It was all about like, oh, open source is evil. It's like, you know, communist run open source, right, that's how you, you know, lose all your, you know, property, right, open sources insecure, yada, yada, yada, right. And I think that is something there that's kind of spread the word is important, right, is to making sure, well, that is actually none of those things, right, and really embrace an open source and the focus on the real open source can be very good, long term ROI for corporations, maybe not a short term, right, but the long term, right. Well, in this case, I probably want to mention one other thing, which I think there is still challenge those days, right. I think what the open source term is being bastardized, right. We can see many companies, they try to say, oh, our software is kind of almost as good as open source, right, but when they put you like, well, some very specially restrictive licenses, right, in this case, right, and we, right, or have like an open core when you have like a crippled open source, right, and real property software, and we need to make sure the company understand there is what is open source, right, and focus on growing that compared to those, well, others. Make sense? Thank you. Hello, thank you for the presentation. In the beginning, we started with a good willingness to make it very portable to other cloud and that kind of stuff, having the deployment that can be multi-cloud. And we missed something because at some point, the experts that were there to help us were pushing for some proprietary or non-compatible deployment, and we are totally stuck now in one cloud provider. How do you manage such a risk, and what would you put as a rule set at the beginning so that you would not fall in that pitfall? Yeah, well, I think that's a very question. I can say, hey, we made a mistake and now we are stuck, right? Well, the thing, I think in this case, right, if you're looking at portability, right, I think it's important what that portability is being tested, right? So in your case, right, if you say, hey, we are mostly on that one cloud vendor and we want to be able to move to have a cloud vendor if we need, well, that means what you need to regularly test your software that actually works on that cloud vendor. So if incompatibility and overreliance is introduced, you can instantly squash that. Because if you don't do it, right, then, you know, like a three-hour or three years later, right, when you finally want to do that, you can say, oh, my gosh, it actually turns out so much the things what we did not do, right? And I think in many cases, what is also important is what developers do not read docs, right? They tinker, right? And often then you think, like, oh, I am using this kind of feature, right, in this case. I assume it works everywhere, but maybe they are actually, you know, using something which only works in this particular place, right? That is why testing is important. You cannot rely on, you know, the developers, right? Or infrastructure engineers just, you know, using their subset they are supposed to be using. Okay. Well, thank you. One more. Oh, one more. Okay. Hi. Thank you. When we have some companies using proprietary Cloud provider, it is difficult for us to say that they need to move all their infrastructure, as you just said. So is it a problem of offer? It is a problem of the free software Cloud provider offer to provide some easy tools to use. Or it is really a problem of politics from the companies to say that, yeah, we should go to the difficult, but free software, how do we manage with that? Well, I mean, you are asking, like, is that like a technical question, right? Or is it politics, right? And the question is both, right? In this case, like, yes, I mean, if you look from a technical standpoint, I think there are easier ways of open-source software where more it is going to be easy to convince, adopt, write and so on and so forth. But in many cases, it is possible. It is also like a politics, right? Because there can be some entrenched interest for whatever reasons, right? Or some belief, right? I have seen a number of companies on my watch, right? They will say, oh, my gosh, we are running on, let's say, like a Microsoft stack. There is no freaking way it is possible we move to open-source, yada, yada, yada, yada, right? And then we have a new CTO, right? And boom, right? You can say in a few years, right, like more than half of workloads are moved to different open-source solutions, right? So I think in this case, like, if you look at what is a primary thing, right, it is politics and desire of a management, right? That is always primary. Okay. Thank you, Peter. Okay.
