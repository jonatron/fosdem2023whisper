They explained the Secure Boot process, their own tooling called Lancer-botel for automatically re-signing boot images, and the need for a BIOS password and full disk encryption for added security. They invited all to collaborate on the project, and discussed upcoming features based on Trusted Platform Modules and other related topics.
