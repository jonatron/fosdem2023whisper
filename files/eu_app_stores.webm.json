{"text": " All right, I have the pleasure of introducing our next speakers, Marcel Helaja and Hans Grossefstein. Thank you. Right, so we have 25 minutes in front of us to speak about EU alternatives to app stores. What is this about? So I will lead you through a tool that is called a pilot project that I have initiated as a member of the European Parliament and what are the potential opportunities that I see here for the free software and open source community. So first, a little bit introduction of myself. As I said, I'm a member and also a cluster of the European Parliament. I'm a member of the Bureau of the European Parliament and I focus my work on policies that I will show you in the next slide in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection and also culture and education. I'm also working in the committee to investigate the use of Pegasus and Equal and Surveillance Pyrir. I'm sure you've heard about that scandal. And I am the first Vice President of the Czech Pirate Party. So what is my focus in policy making? The top two I believe are interlinked, free and open source technologies and freedom on the internet because I think that one cannot exist without the other. Then I also work on transparency and independence of media. Now what are we going to speak about? We're going to speak about the fact that the EU developed, of course, for public money, some applications that you can find, for instance, in Google Play. This is the list from Google Play. So I'm not sure you can really read, but you can see there a couple of applications that may help you to understand your passenger rights or you can see the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. You can account majorities in the council and all sorts of other things that has been, again, developed with public money. Now what's the problem? The problem is that, first of all, I believe that we should adhere to the principle public money, public code. What is developed for public money should, the result should also be public. I believe that EU institutions should lead by example, and therefore I believe that it's also not sufficient only that public money that is invested into software then results into public code, but also the applications need to be accessible for the citizens. The current situation is that the applications that are developed for public money are dependent on proprietary app stores, pretty much only two. One for the Android platform, one for iOS on Apple, and that creates a high barrier for smaller providers to enter the market, and also I believe that is a less choice for consumers because if you for instance have an Android phone but you don't want to have an account with Google, then you basically cannot access these applications at all. Now let's keep that in mind, and now I will explain you what a pilot project is. So a pilot project in this EU terminology together with Preparatory Actions which is a follow-up to pilot projects, they are tools introduced in the EU budget that aim at testing new policy initiatives and preparing the ground for the adoption of future measures. Such pilot projects and Preparatory Actions give members of the European Parliament the possibility to initiate innovative policies and fund them in advance of a legal basis being set. What does it mean? That means that every member of the European Parliament has this opportunity to propose a project that they will ask a funding for from the EU budget, and if it gets approved as part of the EU budget, which means that the Commission needs to be on board, the Parliament needs to be on board, and the Council needs to be on board, then this project is started and then it's up to the Commission to deliver on that project as it was defined. The project can live for maximum two consecutive financial years and then it can be extended to a so-called Preparatory Action. Now that sounds great, what can we do with that? So what I have done is that I have tabled a pilot project that is called Demonopolised Access to EU Applications. In the past I have also tabled another pilot project that is currently in the making. So results are very much possible and should be expected. So what the pilot project speaks about, modern smartphone tablet and desktop environments have established marketplaces such as Google Play or Apple App Store for the installation of maintenance apps. These marketplaces offer convenient and curated apps that come at the cost of high barrier to entry on the market for smaller providers and less choice for consumers. Now the thing is that the European Union has already realized that reliance on large big tech corporations is a bad path forward and that's why the Commission proposed the Digital Markets Act. I worked on the Digital Markets Act as a shadow repertor and one of the provisions in the Digital Markets Act is that these so-called gatekeepers where Google and Apple definitely fall into the scope, they have to enable on their operating systems in the phones installation of applications from other sources than from the official app store which is not the case in iOS at this moment. And that provision basically enables using other repositories, it doesn't have to be a store but package repositories if you will, to install them on the phone and to use the applications from there that decreases the dependency on this big tech. But then I think again as I said the EU institutions should lead by example and therefore this project pilot project aims that the European Union uses other repositories such as Ifdroid to put the applications there so that they can be installed by the users from these let's say alternative app stores to use the EU terminology. Now the objectives from my perspective definitely is that the EU institutions should release their applications on various repositories that aim at promoting applications released under free and open source software licenses and of course releasing the source code then enables people to build, study, improve the application so basically use their rights that they are entitled to according to free software rules basically for freedoms. So this of course is a potential opportunity or these are potential opportunities for the free software community because who else than the free software community can help with releasing these applications into the free software domain. I'd like to remind that the implementation is done by the European Commission, not the European Parliament. The Commission's website for funding and tenders is over here and I believe that the Commission of course is not going to do everything by themselves so they are going to open tenders to deliver on this pilot project and here I need to say that there are some eligibility criteria and admissibility requirements such as and I quote from the Commission's rules that tenders must have the necessary technical, professional, economic and financial capacity to execute the contracts which in other words means well not every entity can actually be a tender but what is important is that joint tenders and subcontracting are also allowed which I believe can also enable the free software community to take part in that. That's all from my side, you can follow me on social networks, obligatory slide, but now I give the floor to Hans Christoph who can speak more from the developer's perspective. So I guess I can start with my personal experience of this, someone working in free software for almost 30 years, you know, the rise of the pirate party movement, something I felt very close to, but where I live it's not so much a thing and then out of the blue, I work on effedroid, out of the blue someone comes to our chat room and says oh did you know there's a pilot project in the EU budget that mentions effedroid and for me it was like okay whoa okay this is interesting and we look and it comes from of course also out of this feeling, you know suddenly it was a blast to the past of like this is what I want to see happen but it seems impossible and then here it is oh no this is political change coming through free software and pirate party, so I just want to thank you for that. My pleasure. So now to effedroid, I think we're talking about free software in the mobile sphere, I think that we can say that the effedroid community is one of the biggest forces pushing free software in the, I mean certainly the android ecosystem but maybe even beyond and we have gotten there because we have, we're this volunteer led organization where people come because they believe in free software and they want to use all their computers including their phones that's all free software and there's a lot of kind of thankless work where you know someone wrote their app and they say I think it's free software and then they submit it to us we review it and you say well actually you know the Google tools don't make it that easy to publish free software they make every step easy to like oh look at this lovely library just pull it in so easy put this line in and then you're tied into the proprietary ecosystem and so we're very often the people who have to say I'm sorry I know you tried but this unfortunately includes proprietary software. So this has I think been, I mean now we're done through you know starting out with much more volunteer apps small scale now after 12 years of doing this going on 13 we have you know well-known names in free software like NextCloud coming to us and relying on us to do this kind of review and then our other organizations which want to go through the process say okay we believe that our publishing free software will make our users trust us more and so we've had companies like Tutanota and Proton VPN go through this process where yeah it's a kind of a thankless tax but people now are willing to do it because of the four freedoms and because this question I think which doesn't come up that much in free software is this question of trust we now see that it's very easy to make software that does things transparently that we really don't like you know we can talk about tracking you can talk about you know software that's designed to be addictive and these kind of things and this this when we have free software then we have the possibility of actually having anyone we trust review it and say like this is doing something that you know this is this is checked out like this software is not doing anything that I would eject to we take the user's point of view say is this something that I want to use and if not we want to flag it and make sure that others who use it also are aware of the things and this in the nephroid terms is anti-features and now this to me is a very exciting opportunity to say okay like this is I live I live in the EU I'm a citizen of a country in the EU this is my government and I would like to do provide these services as well I mean and I'm strong believer of course in public money public code so yeah I feel very fortunate to be in this position and now we also I think I mean this may be this is purely my kind of feeling but a lot of people get involved in free software because they think that other avenues don't really work like government and I was kind of like that I guess as an activist it gave me an opportunity to do something alone starting out myself like this is wrong but I can do something just by myself but now after doing this stuff for long I see like but government can play a role and when it does it get the impact you can have is huge and so to bring these you know these are complicated processes to even learn about this EU pilot project but I hope that this really opens the door to lots of other projects to say like okay this is this is our government let's get involved let's see what we can do with it well so yeah what else can I say I think the last piece of this I mean to me this is a learning experience like how we're gonna engage with the European Commission are we gonna do just advise them in the process are we going to do public tender I'm very interested to see how it goes I'll try to also publish your blog post or something on what I can to so others can learn from this experience and then a simple ask from from everyone is you know what what of these please look at these apps that our government is producing and what's what's the ones that we you know we're doing a pilot project what's the ones that are most important I would love to have feedback on that I think with that I'll say thank you and I think we can take some questions okay we also have some time for questions so could you raise your hands then I collect and start we have one over there thank you for presentation I have a question about payments in the stores so as we know currently Apple and Google don't provide an alternative for okay currently as we know Google and Facebook don't provide the alternatives to payments as we have it in the web because in the web we have a lot of providers a lot of alternatives a lot of different ways to do the payments to roll back the payments and so on there are basically no quote unquote regulations but with this with the title of the topic I would like to raise also the question not about open stores but what if the EU applications would actually require some payment let's say we would like to pay for some for some unenforced unlawful behavior for our for our debts with government what what are you going to do then what if what if that happens maybe you then want to go into the payment route maybe fdroid would be able to well not not exactly only fdroid but maybe alternative stores should be able also to include the payment ecosystem or payment some something like that and not only not it doesn't only include the payments for you apps but if that would be possible maybe other apps could use alternative stores and also have payments which which are not subjected to oligopoly that we have or monopoly that we have currently from my perspective there is no neither technical nor a business reason why other stores could not be connected to payment systems and provide this functionality as well but maybe Hans Christoph wants to add something from a technical perspective but I don't see a reason why why why this this shouldn't be possible yeah there's definitely no technical reason why this should be totally possible but after it we've actually made that we're trying to stay out of that business because it's a very different business than free software okay also I would like to add on that one that this is also relevant to the digital markets act that I that I mentioned because one of the reasons why this provision about app stores is there is because there were past cases that basically anti-monopoly cases according to competition law where where companies were complaining that that Apple is abusing their position on the market to charge them 30% fee like Spotify versus Apple for instance so so this is definitely a very valid area that that something needs to be done about yeah so do I understand correctly that you're basically or is I'm practically screaming in the microphone well try again so do I understand correctly that the EU is embracing after it in this case the EU is what is like embracing the use of after it or or or totally a releasing after it or no no no no no yes yes the question is if if the EU is yeah embracing after it so no after this basically only an example in order to understand what is behind the idea of the pilot project nevertheless that's just an idea and it should be independent of anyone basically so so it would be up to the commission to assess which direction they want to go but apparently I mean we cannot we cannot avoid using the the the major free software repository for Android applications as an example I can add real quick maybe for the stream okay all right that I think relevant here is that free after it is all the free software needed to create create an app store so you know by decentralizing this you know maybe the EU is embracing free software in the sense of anyone can create their own app store and and but yes it's not an official like EU app store right very quickly I was told so you said the the goal of the pilot is kind of to test the waters for new policy new laws does that mean that your ultimate goal would be that something like this would be made mandatory for the European Union to publish their apps in asteroid or other open app repositories well that's not I don't think that at this moment we can put it like that the the tool the pilot project is not necessarily for legislation but it's also for let's say what the institutions should do so basically it's very clear that putting the applications not only on on Google Play and Apple App Store but also elsewhere will also cost some operational money so that's why we have this tool to actually allocate money in the budget give it a try and then at the end of the pilot project it will be evaluated how successful it was and then the Commission can of course make a permanent allocation in the budget to run it there's not necessarily a need for legislation at the end of the pilot project how can people try to make the pilot project succeed how can they help make it succeed the project right that's a very good question and that's basically the whole purpose of this talk so I would so I would recommend the follow the Commission's website there was a link and and see what the Commission is going to open as a tender and then basically anyone in the free software community can contribute as Hans Kristof said either by running for instance jointly in the tender or advising maybe in some you know side capacity to the to the Commission or being a subcontractor of the main tender so that that I think would be the main goal and I can visit the volunteer aspect like the list of apps is public you and you can go get these apps and you can try to review them yourself you can reach out to us we're happy to help people get started on what it takes to review apps so there's easy small steps you can take as well", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start":
