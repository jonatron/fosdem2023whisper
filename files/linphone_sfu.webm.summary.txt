In this talk, Jean Monnier discussed the Linfone video conferencing system, which uses SIP as its base standard, as well as a Selective Forwarding Units (SFU) for media server switching. The system allows for a variety of video layouts and end-to-end encryption, as the server does not decode media streams. The client must be able to handle multi-streams, which includes sending multiple video streams and receiving one from each participant. The talk concluded by discussing upcoming features, such as Xcon conferencing and WebRTC compatibility.
