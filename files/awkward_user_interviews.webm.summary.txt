Emily O'Meara gave a talk at the 2023 FOSDEM conference on why user interviews are important and how to conduct them effectively. She encouraged developers to view user interviews as a way for users to contribute to their projects and to build community. O'Meara discussed the importance of extracting valuable information from users during interviews and offered two techniques for doing so: strategically deploying awkward silences and asking follow-up questions. She also suggested that developers should practice these techniques with friends or colleagues to become more comfortable with them. Finally, O'Meara answered questions from the audience about the potential risks of being awkward during an interview.
