The talk is about a tool called TERME, which provides practical and fun automation for terminal sessions. It works by creating a T-Mux session with two panes where everything typed on the bottom pane goes to both the top and bottom panes, essentially creating an interactive session. The tool has features like macros, scripting, and the ability to wait for specific text or regex, fuzzy find, and sending output to standard input. The speaker also explains why TERME is written in Raku, highlighting its features like asynchronous programming, built-in constructs like supplies and channels, and promises. TERME currently has 43 commands and is open for feature requests.
