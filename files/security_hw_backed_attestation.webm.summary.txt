The speaker discussed the integration of remote attestation as an authentication mechanism in TLS. The current internet security model assumes that the attacker is on the communication path between the peers, but with remote attestation, it becomes possible to provide verifiable metadata about the state of a device, such as firmware, operating system kernel, and software. The speaker explained the theory behind remote attestation and the data flow involved. They also discussed the goals, security, and privacy considerations of integrating remote attestation into TLS. The speaker then talked about their prototype implementation, which includes components like Parsec, Varaison, and Mbeth TLS. They emphasized the importance of open source software and building an ecosystem around their projects. The ultimate goal is to make remote attestation easy to use as a plug-in for authentication in various protocols. The talk concluded with a Q&A session, where questions were asked about the impact on roundtrip times in TLS and the integration of open source firmware.
