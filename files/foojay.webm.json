{"text": " Good morning, everybody. Thank you so much for being here. In the Friends of OpenJDK developer room, the primary focus of what we'll be talking about throughout today is Java, as you'll see, but there's also Kotlin. OpenJDK is large and welcoming to all kinds of languages and technologies, of course. And what we're doing by means of the FUJI project is bringing everyone together across the ecosystem, across the users of the OpenJDK. Over the past years, of course, there's been a lot of innovation. There are a lot of different vendors of Java. There are a lot of different releases of Java. So it's really hard to keep up and to know what's actually happening in Java. And what we're doing by means of the FUJI project is to bring everyone together to have one place where people can go to, to be updated about what's going on in particular in Java. So that site is FUJIO. Go there every day. There are new articles. There are tips. And what's also really important is there's information about the new releases. So there's Kotlin releases of Java, which is fantastic, that there's so much pace and innovation and change. On the other hand, it's really hard to know what's actually happening and what's been added to the Kotlin releases and to the LTSs and just to keep up. So on the FUJIO site, we have information about all the fixes and all the enhancements, et cetera, et cetera, that you can find there. There's also a Slack channel that you can join. So you're going to see this particular URL quite a lot today. This is going to point you directly to the Slack. And the Slack channel is for everyone interested in just discussing Java in one way or another. If you're getting started with Java, if you're some kind of expert Java developer, if you want to share tips and tricks, if you want to collaborate with the Java community at large, just join the Slack channel and you will find many new friends. Today, we have a really great program for you and it's a fast-paced program. So every 20 minutes, there's a new session. And it's by a range of different people from a range of different companies. You're going to see Simon in a minute talking about, after all these years, why Java is still so popular. You have Johan talking about upgrading to Java 17 and then a range of other topics. So just stay sitting. You'll be entertained throughout the day. And if you're bored at any moment, just wait 15 minutes and you'll be in another session. And again, you're going to see this link throughout the day. This will bring you directly to the Slack channel. And with that, I'm going to tell you again to go to the site. Every day, there are new tips and insights and articles and so on. And the link directly to the Slack channel.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 9.68, "text": " Good morning, everybody. Thank you so much for being here.
