The talk is about time-sensitive networking (TSN) and its applications in real-time data transport over networks. The speaker discusses the requirements and challenges of TSN applications, such as establishing a common time base in the network, minimizing transmission latency, ensuring quality of service, and implementing link layer redundancy. They also outline the kernel and user space components used in building TSN applications, including time synchronization with GPTP, traffic shaping with the TC subsystem, network management with stream reservation protocols, and real-time data packetization. The speaker mentions that TSN implementations are already available and that they are actively being used in various industries, including professional audio-video systems. They also acknowledge the need for better debugging tools and invite the audience to collaborate on developing an automated analysis tool for TSN networks. The talk concludes with a Q&A session.
