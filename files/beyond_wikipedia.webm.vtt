00:00.000 --> 00:12.640
Hi and welcome everyone. I am here today to speak to you about a little bit about Wikimedia's

00:12.640 --> 00:20.880
open source ecosystem. So I assume all of you know what Wikipedia is and maybe some

00:20.880 --> 00:28.080
of you know that it runs on a software that is called MediaWiki. So all the Wikis run

00:28.080 --> 00:33.560
on this software but there's also tens of thousands of websites around the world that

00:33.560 --> 00:41.880
use this. A very cool example is NASA is using it for some other projects. But this is sort

00:41.880 --> 00:46.640
of the core of Wikipedia and the other projects and it's of course something that is open

00:46.640 --> 00:53.520
source that anyone can contribute to but it's not what I'm going to be talking about today.

00:53.520 --> 00:59.840
Because surrounding Wikipedia in all the other projects there is a huge ecosystem of software

00:59.840 --> 01:09.680
tools. You can think of these as like third party integrations. People build bots that

01:09.680 --> 01:15.760
do edits on Wikipedia. That fight vandalism. There are machine learning algorithms. There

01:15.760 --> 01:22.860
are pipelines for data that then go to research purposes. There's a lot going on. So I'm going

01:22.860 --> 01:31.760
to be talking about this part. Just a quick word about me. I'm a software engineer with

01:31.760 --> 01:38.280
a technical engagement team. You can see we're part of the technology department and our

01:38.280 --> 01:45.000
team is kind of split into parts. We have the cloud services team, SREs and engineers

01:45.000 --> 01:50.520
that build services and platforms for all these tool developers. Then we have developer

01:50.520 --> 01:58.360
advocacy. They do a lot of things. They are writing documents and running outreach programs

01:58.360 --> 02:04.760
and doing everything so that our technical contributors can build cool stuff on top of

02:04.760 --> 02:15.480
our platforms and content. So just to give you an idea of the scale of this, we have

02:15.480 --> 02:22.880
over 300,000 editors that contribute to Wikimedia projects every month. Wikimedia comments,

02:22.880 --> 02:28.920
which is the project that is for free, media files, videos, images, so on. There are now

02:28.920 --> 02:36.920
over 90 million media files on there. And we have 1.7 billion unique devices that access

02:36.920 --> 02:44.760
Wikimedia against statistics for every month. So some of you may recognize at least some

02:44.760 --> 02:50.920
of these projects. Of course, Wikimedia is the flagship. There are other ones like Wikidata,

02:50.920 --> 02:59.480
comments that we just mentioned, Wiktionary, and many more. So yeah, we're going to take

02:59.480 --> 03:04.080
a look at these tools, ecosystems that I mentioned in the beginning, and we're going to start

03:04.080 --> 03:12.520
from Wikimedia. This is the thing that most people know about us. And from there, yeah,

03:12.520 --> 03:15.680
we're going to explore the tools that are community-created software that interacts

03:15.680 --> 03:21.840
with and contributes to Wikimedia projects in some way. An example here is PyWikibot.

03:21.840 --> 03:27.720
It's a framework for building bots. So if you have a wiki and you want to run some kind

03:27.720 --> 03:35.120
of bot that does something, some type of edits, you would very likely use PyWikibot as a framework

03:35.120 --> 03:44.240
to develop this. From the tools themselves, we're going to go and have a look at the services

03:44.240 --> 03:54.160
and the platforms that support them. And we're going to start with an example of a couple

03:54.160 --> 04:00.720
tools and how they actually integrate with one of the projects. So this is a wiki project

04:00.720 --> 04:07.360
called Women in Red. And a wiki project is a group of users on Wikipedia that decide

04:07.360 --> 04:13.280
that they want to work on something specific. They come together to work as a group. And

04:13.280 --> 04:20.000
in this case, it's to fight the content-general gap. So they observe that only around 15 percent

04:20.000 --> 04:29.600
of English Wikipedia biographies were about women. And as of the 23rd of January this year,

04:29.600 --> 04:38.520
they have managed to take this number up to around 19.45 percent in about seven or eight

04:38.520 --> 04:44.840
years. And so where does this very precise statistic come from? You can see mentioned

04:44.840 --> 04:52.080
here in red, it's something called human-niki. And so this is what we would call a tool.

04:52.080 --> 04:57.600
And in this case, this is a dashboard. It provides statistics about the gender gap on

04:57.600 --> 05:03.680
all the Wikipedia projects. And you can see here that female content is the orange part

05:03.680 --> 05:11.000
and then the rest is male. And if you go to this website, you can see it in a more granular

05:11.000 --> 05:25.240
way by country, by project, by date of birth, and so on.

05:25.240 --> 05:31.320
So if you want to contribute to this project, an easy way to do it is to go to this Wikipedia

05:31.320 --> 05:36.120
project site and you can see different lists that have been curated. For instance, here

05:36.120 --> 05:43.840
we can see female activists. So you can get a list of all the female activists. And there

05:43.840 --> 05:48.360
are many, many categories like this. And some of these lists are curated by humans, but

05:48.360 --> 05:56.960
most of these lists actually come from a bot that's called ListeriaBot, which curates,

05:56.960 --> 06:01.800
which makes queries on Wikidata, which is another one of the projects. You can think

06:01.800 --> 06:08.880
of it like a huge knowledge graph that you can query using a similar language to SQL.

06:08.880 --> 06:17.920
It's called Sparkle. So yeah, you can use Wikidata to get lists with very high granularity.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.840
You can have activists from Germany or activists from Germany that were born after a certain

06:22.840 --> 06:30.760
date. And so this is what ListeriaBot does.

06:30.760 --> 06:36.280
So we have seen two different tools. One was a dashboard, one was a bot. And there are

06:36.280 --> 06:41.880
thousands of these tools. There are thousands of maintainers. And we're going to take a

06:41.880 --> 06:50.520
look at how we sustain these people. So I mentioned that my team is the cloud services

06:50.520 --> 06:58.600
team. And what we do is we provide hosting. We provide compute virtual machines. We provide

06:58.600 --> 07:04.960
data services for all these tools to function. And so again, to give you an idea of the scale

07:04.960 --> 07:11.480
of this, 30% of all the edits on Wikipedia as of 2020 were made by bots hosted on our

07:11.480 --> 07:19.600
services. For Wikidata, that number is a little bit higher. It's around 50%. So just

07:19.600 --> 07:27.680
to make you aware that this is a quite important part of the ecosystem.

07:27.680 --> 07:34.120
So I mentioned there are thousands of tools. And as of a couple of years ago, we now have

07:34.120 --> 07:38.960
a catalog where you can browse and search and find the tool you need for your project

07:38.960 --> 07:45.400
or if you are a tool maintainer, you can add it here so that people know it exists. Then

07:45.400 --> 07:50.640
what you see here are lists that have been curated. We have something called the Coolest

07:50.640 --> 07:56.800
Tool Award. So if you look down, you can see that Humaniki was one of the award-winning

07:56.800 --> 08:05.240
tools in 2021. Some of you may recognize this as a Jupyter

08:05.240 --> 08:12.240
Notebook. So this is a Jupyter Hub deployment that we have that is directly integrated with

08:12.240 --> 08:18.160
all of our data services so that people can access dumps, they can access Wikireplicas,

08:18.160 --> 08:25.000
they can access a lot of things that otherwise would be gigabyte and gigabyte and gigabyte

08:25.000 --> 08:32.920
of data they would have to download onto their own computers.

08:32.920 --> 08:40.040
Another tool is called Query. It's a public query interface for Wikireplicas. Wikireplicas,

08:40.040 --> 08:46.280
I didn't mention it, there are replicas of our production databases. And the cool thing

08:46.280 --> 08:53.000
about this is that all the queries are public so people can actually search and see other

08:53.000 --> 08:58.640
people's queries and be inspired or if you're not very good with SQL, you can adapt someone's

08:58.640 --> 09:15.120
query to your needs. Here you can see a specific query.

09:15.120 --> 09:22.160
So these services are still tools that serve this ecosystem but we also need somewhere

09:22.160 --> 09:30.480
to host them. So though we have a platform as a services offering, it's called Toolforged.

09:30.480 --> 09:35.520
It's not quite as fancy as Heroku or DigitalOcean or anything of this sort. If you look closely

09:35.520 --> 09:41.640
you see that you have to actually SSH into it. But it's still very powerful and very

09:41.640 --> 09:49.160
convenient for our users. It integrates again with data sources and it has managed databases,

09:49.160 --> 09:58.000
a elastic search cluster that everyone can use without having to maintain all these systems

09:58.000 --> 10:05.120
themselves. So yeah, the back end here is Kubernetes.

10:05.120 --> 10:13.480
Then for more complicated projects, some projects need more compute for instance. We also have

10:13.480 --> 10:21.080
a CloudVPS offering so that people can spin up their own virtual machines and basically

10:21.080 --> 10:32.000
do what they want on them. So this runs on top of OpenStack.

10:32.000 --> 10:41.240
And how could one get involved with this? So it's possible to get involved in any of

10:41.240 --> 10:49.840
these layers, either as a tool maintainer or as maintainer of any of these platforms.

10:49.840 --> 10:55.360
And that's kind of the thing I wanted to highlight a little bit today is that this is kind of

10:55.360 --> 11:07.800
a unique opportunity to actually contribute to platform and to infrastructure. We have

11:07.800 --> 11:16.520
people that work with our team and they are on our IRC channels and they push patches

11:16.520 --> 11:20.920
just like everyone else and if you don't know you would think they are just another software

11:20.920 --> 11:29.720
engineer on the team. And I asked some of them why, what brings you here? And of course

11:29.720 --> 11:34.680
many of them associate with their free knowledge and free knowledge movement and open source

11:34.680 --> 11:40.760
and all of that. But many also said that this is a unique opportunity to actually play with

11:40.760 --> 11:47.360
things like OpenStack or Terraform or Kubernetes in a situation where actually you have real

11:47.360 --> 11:52.840
traffic and real users which is something that is kind of very difficult to do at home

11:52.840 --> 12:01.040
and there are not many other projects where you would have this possibility.

12:01.040 --> 12:12.600
So some ways to get involved. We have several outreach programs. We have Outreachy which

12:12.600 --> 12:23.000
is an internship that runs twice a year. It's targeted more towards underrepresented demographic.

12:23.000 --> 12:31.440
Google summer code that's once a year and both programs are open to anyone so you don't

12:31.440 --> 12:35.640
have to be a student. You could be someone who is changing careers or doing some kind

12:35.640 --> 12:42.080
of a letter move. Google summer code has also become more flexible. It's not just summer

12:42.080 --> 12:46.840
anymore. There are shorter projects. There are longer projects. So that could be a way

12:46.840 --> 12:56.640
to get involved and get some kind of hands-on mentorship. Another way would be to come

12:56.640 --> 13:03.320
to the Wikimedia hackathons. We have one in Athens in May this year and then one is

13:03.320 --> 13:11.240
part of Wikimedia that takes part in Singapore that is in Singapore in August. And of course

13:11.240 --> 13:16.880
if you are brave you can just dive right in because everything we do is open and it's

13:16.880 --> 13:25.880
out there on the internet. Documentation of course but just even our project boards and

13:25.880 --> 13:33.000
fabricator it's a collaborative software for task management and such. So if you go there

13:33.000 --> 13:38.480
you would see that there is a huge variety of tasks. You can see the work boards of different

13:38.480 --> 13:45.560
teams at the foundation. You can see volunteer led projects and projects where people work

13:45.560 --> 13:52.840
together alongside each other. So a way could be simply to find something that interests

13:52.840 --> 14:03.280
you and look at the documentation and then come on our IRC channels and contact us and

14:03.280 --> 14:13.960
that's it. So yeah I have added some links which can be helpful to get started. And you

14:13.960 --> 14:19.160
are of course free to just reach out to me. I had my Twitter handle on the first slide

14:19.160 --> 14:36.600
and my slides are published on the website. We have 45 seconds for questions. Thank you.

14:36.600 --> 14:54.000
Thank you.
