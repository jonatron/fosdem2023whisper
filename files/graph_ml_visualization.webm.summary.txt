The talk discusses a new approach to graph visualization algorithms that use artificial intelligence (AI) and cost functions to improve design control of layouts. The speakers explain how cost functions can encode graphic features, and how gradient calculations can be split into threads to improve efficiency and showcase a web application that uses the stress function and parallel programming on CPUs to visualize large graphs with interactivity. They also mention future work such as introducing more cost functions and transforming the problem from parallel CPUs to parallel GPUs. The Q&A session covers topics such as supporting interactive adding of new nodes, comparisons to force-directed algorithms, and tools used for calculating partial derivatives in the cost function.
