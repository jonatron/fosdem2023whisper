[00:00.000 --> 00:10.640]  Good morning and welcome to the Network Deadroom. Today, we are very packed, so we don't have
[00:10.640 --> 00:15.960]  a lot of time. As you can see, we have several talks and there is little time between the
[00:15.960 --> 00:21.920]  talks. And we start with the first session about, let's say, pure networking, okay, and
[00:21.920 --> 00:29.480]  the second part is dedicated to Kubernetes and to this type of container-based technology.
[00:29.480 --> 00:37.680]  We'll be talking about several topics, starting from, you know, network monitoring and security,
[00:37.680 --> 00:43.880]  and then we still have that. And then I said, moving down, we'll move to Wi-Fi to mesh and
[00:43.880 --> 00:51.520]  then to Kubernetes. We try to have sessions that last five minutes before the end, so
[00:51.520 --> 00:56.320]  that we have five minutes left for questions that probably is not much, but this is what
[00:56.320 --> 01:00.280]  we can offer today. We try to keep everybody in the program.
