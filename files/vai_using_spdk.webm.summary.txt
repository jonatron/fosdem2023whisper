In this talk, Damien discussed an open source project to improve the storage performance of virtual machines. He proposed implementation of the SPPDK driver and grant table interface to directly transfer BLKV requests from the virtual machine to the underlying storage platform, which would reduce costs and improve performance. Additionally, they looked into ways to reduce the amount of memory being copied from the virtual machine to DOM0.
