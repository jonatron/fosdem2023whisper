The talk is about a new project called AsyncGetStackTrace, which is an improved version of the AsyncGetCallTrace API. The main purpose of the project is to provide more profiling information and make it easier for developers to walk stacks. The new API provides more information, such as the type, BCI, method ID, and compilation level, and it also allows developers to walk non-Java frames and threads. The speaker has been working on this project since the beginning of last year and is still in the process of testing it. The talk also includes a Q&A section.
