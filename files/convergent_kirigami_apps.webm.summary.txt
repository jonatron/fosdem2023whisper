The talk is about Kirigami, a QML-based framework for building mobile and desktop applications. It was developed to build applications for both mobile and desktop, making it easier to build applications for both platforms using the same code. The speaker describes how Kirigami works, including pages and drivers, and gives examples of Kirigami-based applications such as NeoChat, Tocodon, and Calendar. The speaker also discusses the devices that support Plasma Mobile well and the long-term goals of the project. Finally, there is a Q&A session where questions about Kirigami's support for progressive web apps, the switch between light and dark modes, and the porting of KDE desktop applications to Kirigami are answered.
