{"text": " Hello, everyone. I'm Zahra. I work for Microsoft as a part of Linux Systems Group, LSU. This type is going to be about an ongoing project that we have on hardening Linux kernel with architecture capabilities. To be clear, this is not a product by Microsoft, so it's more like an exploratory project that we want to see if this hardware feature can be used for security issues that we want to fix on Linux kernel, and also as a part of this process, if we can find some new vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and things like that. So I'm going to start with a very brief background, like an intro on Cherry and a state of the world Linux, and then some of my work that capability-based hardening and future work and opportunities that I'm really hopeful that open source community can help us with that. So the big picture problem is that, as you all know, operating systems are really complex. We have millions of lines of code with a lot of complex abstractions, and basically any forms of proper hardening for a kernel is still an open problem. We have all kinds of software-based, like control flow integrity, like approaches, like compiler-based techniques for fuzzing, and all of these approaches are helpful, but we still see lots of vulnerabilities. Some of these are memory safety, like many of them are memory safety, but some are also logical problems because of this complex monolithic structure of the kernel. At the same time, Linux kernel also has different security subsystems. We have a combination of, for example, LSMs, DAC, sandboxing techniques for, for example, SECCOM, EVPF, and still also in this complex stack, the proper integration and hardening of these security subsystems themselves is not also a clear, we don't have a clear solution for that. At the same time, we also have a lot of ongoing hardware security features that are going, like, are adding to or suffer our hardware platforms. Like, for example, just on ARM, we have a combination of, like, core-screen privilege separation techniques, like trust zone T's. We have, like, more, like, at the same time, like, finer-grained memory safety features, like pointer authentication, memory tag extensions, and as we go, like, for example, modern hardware, we can have, like, for example, resource domain controllers, and all of these, like, hardware features are not really, so they are there, but our operating system doesn't really use them, like, in a fundamental way, like, in a basically principal approach. So this is the big picture of, like, lots of problems that we have for both hardening the kernel and also, like, using these hardware security features properly. And Cherry is one of, like, this fine-grained both for memory safety and for extensible compartmentalization features. That it has, like, a really old history from the University of Cambridge. I think, like, about 14, 15 years of, like, research is behind it. And the concept of, like, capability-based security models, it's, that concept is not new. We have it, like, even on, like, file descriptor, like, abstraction for Linux. So basically, having an unforeachable, like, token of authority that's, it's for, like, accessing any kind of, like, sensitive object. But the novelty of Cherry is that you have this hardware-software semantic approach for bringing this, like, concept, this, like, memory safety concept to, like, both your hardware architecture and, like, an instruction level and also, like, really have the opportunity to redesign your systems as, like, based on that. So they have, like, these extensions on MIPS, on RISC-5, and on, recently on ARM. And also, like, I think they complete, like, an example of their systems as, like, is based on previousity. So the Linux one is a new one that's mostly ARM, like, folks are working on. So what's Morello? Morello is, basically, the new development, like, experiments kind of, like, board for having, for adding Cherry to ARM V8. And it's extending, like, basically, the entire, like, instructions with, like, new registers and new sets of, like, and also extending, like, previous, like, systems registers for ARM. It's basically, like, introducing, like, the 129-bit pointers. So every Cherry pointer has, like, besides the value, it has the whole set of, like, metadata that contains its bond, boundary of, like, the memory region, the object type, and the permissions, like, basically, for any kind of, like, access to that pointer. And ARM also has this, like, added this notion of, like, controlled non-monoticity. That's basically, like, it's trying to also, because, as you know, like, ARM has, like, at least six execution levels for, like, EL0, EL1, EL2, and, like, at the same time, like, in the secure board. So somehow, this notion of, like, Moeller should be extended to all of these execution levels. So that's why they added this through, like, new exceptions sets, new executive and restrictive mode, privileged execution, and also some unsealing, like, operation that I'm going to describe later. So for every pointer, we have this permission set that, basically, by hardware, you can say, like, this, like, piece of memory should have what kind of, like, permission access. It can have, like, load, execute, just store, or even more complex, like, access controls, like, if you want to have it immutable, for example, like, region, like, through ceiling, or if you want to have even, like, systems-based, like, access controls, like, for, and software-defined, like, waste access controls, that if you want to have your own custom, basically, permissions to be defined for that, like, pointer, that capability. And the interesting thing is that, like, this system, like, accessing system registers that you can define to these capabilities, it's, the behavior is still, it's not, like, really affected by your, like, hypervisor mode, like, HVC calls, SMC calls to set security monitor, and also supervisor mode. So as you can see, besides, besides, like, the notion of, like, capabilities, you need to, like, change, basically, ARM had to change, like, several of, like, system registers, including the control registers. It, like, we have new registers, for example, for bounds, for setting, like, converting, like, pointer capabilities, like, we had to, we have to, like, have a new, like, PC, like, program counter, like, in some PCC, for example, instead of, like, PC, but at the same time, the execution levels for, like, EL0, EL1, EL2, and EL2, all of these should also be aware of the concept of capabilities. So most of, like, the control registers should also, like, they're also changed. And there are, like, you see, like, for example, CTLR, it's now, like, capability-based, like, CTLR. And this, this similar thing, for example, for, like, trade IDs, and things like that. So, for example, like, the neural Linux, like, trade structure tab, like, instead of, like, trade ID, like, traditional, it has, like, control capability-based trade IDs, or restrictive-based, like, trade IDs, that you can find most of these details in the technical manual. Similarly, as I said, like, we have a new set of exceptions for, basically, capability-based exceptions for any faults that you get from, like, permissions, like, accessing them, like, setting boundaries, like, right or wrong, so things like that. So, as I said, the whole details, it's, like, basically, a lot of details, so you can find them mostly on, like, Cherry site, and Morello, like, project, all of them, especially the arm one, it's, like, everything is, like, open, so you can, I'd really, like, if anybody in community to go and check this. So, about the state of Morello Linux, it's, the, the maintainers are most from ARM. They are really doing a very good job on, basically, in a very short time, they have a stable environment for Linux development. If you go, look at that, you see that, like, they're already, like, enabled most, most syscals. They're already, like, they have, like, distros, like, like, Debian, and they have both, like, even if you don't have, like, the development board, you can just, like, use their FVP, fixed virtualization platform, something that's basically an good emulator. And the whole system is, like, really, like, ready for experiment for both from the user space and the kernel development. Also, like, from their perspective, like, they modified most of, like, the main modifications of, like, memory management for adding capability-based architecture and things, like, that they're added. The main problems now that I'm going to discuss are from the security perspective, can be from the, like, the intersections of, like, user and security, user space and, like, the kernel space security, their interactions, their shared memory, and things like that. So, for example, in my experience, when, so, I first started with enabling some of the security features to more Linux, and the experiment was, like, really easy. I was just, trying to, like, for example, get the TE stack, like, TE driver running, adding, like, trusted keys, like, like, BVPF, like, checking, like, if the BVPF is working, like, properly on more low. And in most of the cases, when you want to add, like, these features to the more Linux, the, like, issues that I was seeing is, like, minor issues. So, basically, mostly, like, pointer mismatch, like, in the current architecture that they have, like, a pure capability-based ABI, most of the, like, so, basically, most of the issues coming from, like, when you enable these features, like, you have, like, traditional pointer abstractions that you need to convert them to capability-based abstraction. And, for example, like, when I was working on enabling the U-Axis, that, as you know, like, U-Axis is mostly from the Linux, but you have, like, all of the Linux abstraction for, like, function for communicating with the user space, like, passing pointers, passing shared memory, and things like that. And so, this required, like, low-level, like, I think, capability, like, instructions to Linux. And after we did that, like, changing the put user, like, get user, and things like that, basically, like, the kernel breaks, like, in several places. But the break was mostly on, like, okay, for example, here, on, I notify user, it says that, like, this pointer, like, it's a, like, integer user space, like, pointer. And so, it's not a capability. So, basically, we need to find out, like, dig out, like, what kind of, like, pointer is, it's, like, that, it's an address, or it's just, like, an integer pointer, and things like that. And try to use the abstract, like, tree abstraction to convert them, like, in a secure way, to capability. And then, like, it, for example, this one was, like, a kind of large patch that still needs more filling up. But, like, after fixing this, like, about 50 files, but in a very, like, a small, like, lines of code, you have, like, we have the user space, like, based, like, capability back-ends for Linux. But the tweaks are, like, actually, the good thing about this, this process is that you can find out, like, dig out, like, if there is a, like, basically, viability, like, if there were, at some, some of them, it was just not just a cherry, like, the pointer mismatch was, like, something that could, could provide, like, could be an issue, like, in the future, like, to have memory viability issues, or things like that, or if, for example, they had the boundaries right, and things that can go wrong, even, like, if we don't have cherry. So, the good news is, you have a lot of helper functions, like, from the compiler for, like, using cherry, getting, like, setting boundaries, and, like, converting capabilities to pointers and vice versa. So, that's good. The other thing that's, so, the current state of the model in Linux is that there's a main root capability that's, basically, every other capability is generated from that. So, what I'm working on is, basically, adding more, like, finer-growing, like, capabilities for both ceiling, like, making, especially, like, the sensitive, like, parts of the user space or the kernel immutable after, like, the operations are done. And, also, like, so, basically, we need to add more root capabilities for the user space, for, like, a specific capability for ceiling and making, like, both the kernel subsystems and user space subsystems immutable. And, also, we need to use better the concept of, like, this software-defined permissions on cherry. So, one of the, for example, custom, like, permissions that are added on free BSD is the permission on syscalls and permission on software, for example, virtual memory. So, this will, kind of, like, let them to define, like, and sandboxing the, like, environment, sandboxing abstractions that's, basically, backed by cherry. That's, like, this, this is, like, a really useful thing that, for example, can be, like, useful for EVPF or sitcom-based syscall filtering. So, the other thing that, like, we are working on is that, like, what's, basically, the better combinations of, like, this software-defined permissions for Linux and sandboxing. That's, basically, can, can get a lot of, like, feedback, it's usually useful to get feedback from EVPF guys, like, spokes and, like, sandboxing people that are working on sandboxing. So, see if, like, we can add these kind of, like, abstractions and integrate them properly to Linux security subsystems. So, as I said, like, most of the, like, the goal of this project at the end is, like, we want to use this hardware feature, like, similar hardware features, for protecting Linux security subsystems. LSMs, EVPF, and name-assets. So, basically, this is a very, like, open, like, area that it can be, like, really benefited from community and open-source community to be involved. And, besides that, one of the things that it's, like, it's, it's really, like, an earliest stage for, for it is that the whole systems are stacked from the hypervisor, from secure kernels and trusted execution environments. Now, for the first time, we have this option that we can, like, integrate fine-grained, like, memory protections and scalable, like, compartmentalization features to, for example, or trusted execution environment. And there's, like, a huge area of, like, attack vectors between the interactions of, like, this secure world and, like, the normal world and, like, the kernel environment and all of these, like, systems are stacked now have, like, a way to, like, to protect us from the secure RPC passing, like, pointers. That's basically the main attack vectors for all of, like, T, T environments. Now, we have the options to redesign these stacks based on these fine-grained security features. So, to summarize, the state of Linux, the Moerla Linux is really ready for, like, a special open-source community to get involved. And there are a lot of, like, basically open problems that we're looking forward to, like, get feedback from, especially, like, Linux community that are working on security subsystem to both, like, hardening the kernel itself, hardening the kernel security subsystems and, at the same time, adding more compartmentalization tools, sandboxing tools based on these kind of fine-grained features. Because at the end, the Linux, like, privilege separation is really coarse-grained. And most of the problems are, like, from, like, these huge, more intricate stacks can be solved if we have a more, like, better abstraction for privilege separation and compartmentalization. Also, from people, like, if they're working on debugging and tracing, that's also, like, a huge problem, like, open a space for capability-based systems, how we do it securely, how we basically do it properly. Now, you have these options that, for example, like, instead of the, you can define, for example, secure domains for, like, giving some capabilities to, for secure debugging. And then, for example, like, you don't need to be worried about, like, shutting down security, like, security, for example, secure boot or, like, security features of your system just to do debugging. Because, as you know, like, it's a, by nature, it's an insecure property. So, I'm happy to get any questions if you have. And let me know if you're interested in working on this project.
