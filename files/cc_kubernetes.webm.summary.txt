The talk discusses the idea of creating a confidential cluster in Kubernetes to address the challenges of applying confidential computing technology in cloud-native applications. The speaker presents three tiers of use cases for confidential computing: managing cryptographic keys, packaging applications inside a confidential container, and making the cluster itself confidential. They explain how the confidential cluster concept works, including joining nodes to the cluster through remote attestation, and how updates and upgrades are handled seamlessly inside the cluster. The speaker also mentions the need for a simple and easy-to-use user interface and highlights the open-source nature of the software tool called Constellation, which enables the creation and management of confidential clusters. The talk concludes by addressing concerns about trust, such as the firmware used in the confidential VMs, and invites the audience to get in touch for more information and questions.
