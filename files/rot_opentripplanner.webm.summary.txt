The speaker, Hannes Jornilla, discussed OpenTrip Planner, an open source journey planner, and its evolution over the years. OpenTrip Planner is used by Entur, a company that handles all public transit timetable information in Norway. The speaker explained the main pain points of OpenTrip Planner 1, such as limitations with the journey planning algorithm and lack of coordination in development. OpenTrip Planner 2 addressed these issues and introduced new features like flexible transit routes and a separate data model. The speaker also discussed future plans, including performance improvements and a unified GraphQL API.
