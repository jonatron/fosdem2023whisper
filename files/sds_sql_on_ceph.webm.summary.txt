Patrick Donnelly from Red Hat (now IBM) gave a talk at FOSDEM 2023 about SQL on Ceph using the new library called LibCephSQLite. Ceph is an ecosystem for distributed object storage and LibCephSQLite is a library for putting a SQLite database in Ceph, allowing SQL to be run on Ceph. It is useful when one wants to do something that is not dependent on other storage abstractions. The library uses the virtual file system concept (VFS) and requires no application modification. It is also easy to use and set up, and is being used in a few modules within Ceph Manager. Future work includes adding support for concurrent readers and improving read-ahead performance.
