In this talk, a compliance toolchain for yacht projects was presented. This toolchain, composed of different tools and software from multiple open source projects and the Eclipse Oniro project, has achieved 100% coverage for all components. It uses a graph database for software composition analysis and and incompatibility checks, as well as file-level mapping of licenses to create relationships between components. A set of rules have also been defined to decide which license card wins in order to automatically ensure licenses compatibility.
