The talk was about building a web UI for the Fedora installer, called Anaconda. The current GTK interface is old and has some limitations. By building a web UI, they can address UX issues, achieve consistency, and tap into the larger community and resources available for web technologies. They are using ReactJS and PatternFly for the web UI. They are also using the Cockpit test framework for unit testing. Currently, they have a functional system with basic features such as language selection and disk selection. They plan to focus on storage and add more screens in the future. There are some challenges, such as choosing the right web engine and addressing authentication and encryption. They are also considering integrating the Web UI with Cockpit for machine provisioning.
