The talk discusses two methods for protecting data at runtime in the cloud: VM-based isolation and SGX-based isolation. While SGX has a smaller trusted computing base, it is Intel-specific and has limitations with certain databases. Attestation is also important for remote verification of the system's security. The talk goes on to discuss how the SSTV open-source project integrates confidentiality into databases like MariaDB by allowing users to define a confidential computing front-end with user credentials and attestation statements. The talk concludes with a Q&A section that includes questions about the process runtime, caches, and instructions used for switching context.
