The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was given by Jadka and Jens, who presented the SNAP programming language. SNAP is a visual block space programming language aimed at high school and college students. The talk highlighted three guiding principles of SNAP: low floor, wide walls, and no ceiling. The low floor principle focuses on engaging activities for entry-level programmers, while the wide walls principle allows for a variety of projects, particularly in media computation. The no ceiling principle aims to provide a programming language that can be used by students of all levels, including university students. The talk also demonstrated the capabilities of SNAP, including building custom blocks and creating micro worlds.
