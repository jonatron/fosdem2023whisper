The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 discussed the implementation of a common S-bomb (Software Bill of Materials) format called Standard Bomb at Siemens, a large technology company. The speakers emphasized the importance of accurate and automated S-bomb generation for security and license compliance. They also highlighted the challenges of generating S-bombs, especially for multiple language projects and containers. The use of the Cyclone DX format was favored over SPDX due to its lightweight and flexible nature. The speakers shared their experiences and sought feedback from the audience on their approach and plans for open sourcing their tools. In the Q&A session, questions were raised about S-bomb generation for Siemens' supply chain and container scanning methods. The session concluded with a discussion on ensuring the completeness of dependency scans.
