This talk introduced the Sovereign Cloud Deaf Room at FOSDEM 2023 and discussed digital sovereignty, open source infrastructure, and cloud identity management. It focused on the Project Operate First by Red Hat and the MOC Alliance project by Boston University, both of which aim to create open clouds for academia and beyond. The speakers highlighted the need for proper definition and discussion around digital sovereignty, and their own roles in working in the sovereign cloud space on a day-to-day basis.
