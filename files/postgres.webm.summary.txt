The speaker discussed Postgres observability and its integration with observability tools. They highlighted the challenges of mapping Postgres metrics to tools like Prometheus and explained the difficulties of obtaining detailed metrics due to the need for a functioning SQL session in Postgres. The speaker also presented a proof of concept for a background worker within Postgres that can directly export standardized metrics to avoid dependencies on SQL sessions. They mentioned potential plans for adding tracing capabilities to Postgres as well. The talk emphasized the importance of standardized metrics and expressed hopes for easier deployment and monitoring of Postgres using Prometheus. However, the speaker noted that their proof of concept is in early stages and not ready for production use. In the Q&A session, questions were asked about obtaining the proof of concept, exposing metrics through an HTTP endpoint, and standardizing database monitoring metrics across different databases, but the speaker did not have concrete answers for these topics.
