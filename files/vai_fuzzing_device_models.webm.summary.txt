The speaker discussed their experience with implementing fuzzing in Brazil and the issues they faced. Fuzzing is an automated testing technique where random input is sent to a program to see how it behaves. The speaker implemented fuzzing for VMRTIO in the RescueMeMo project and discovered three crashes during fuzzing. They also faced issues with reusing the generated corpus, covering all areas of the code, and using coverage information to decide when to stop fuzzing. They discussed how to adapt the mock interface for the driver, and answered questions about the computational requirements and the fixes implemented for discovered bugs.
