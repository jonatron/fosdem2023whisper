The speaker, who developed it, spoke about its features, including its flexibility, customizable configuration files, and language interpreter, which allows for customized commands and auto-completion. Additionally, the speaker discussed the potential for future improvements to the language and the tool's compatibility with SVG images. The talk concluded with an invitation to attend another presentation about interactive usage of VIM.
