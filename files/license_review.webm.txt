[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Please give a warm welcome to our next speaker, Pam Chastak.
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.000]  All right.
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.000]  I hear my mic working.
[00:19.000 --> 00:23.000]  So I am here on behalf of the Open Source Initiative,
[00:23.000 --> 00:25.000]  of which I am a board member,
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  to talk about some changes that we just announced,
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  or let me put it this way, draft proposed changes.
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.000]  That's why we're here, is to kind of discuss these changes
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  and discuss, improve, take comments on these proposed changes
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  to the license review process.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  Let's see.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  So just the background, the first meeting was November 2020,
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  which was a long time ago, and we had COVID.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  So, you know, our timelines ran long,
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  and our last meeting was September 23rd,
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  and these were the participants in the working group
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  that we had set up for this,
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  which I'm very pleased with this group of participants.
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  I think we had a really nice array of different voices
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  and different thoughts and different backgrounds
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  who participated.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  So the announcement, it was announced,
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  this draft proposal was announced on the OSI website.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  I apologize for the long URLs, which are useful to no one.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  But if you go to the OSI website,
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  you should go to the blogs, you should be able to find it.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  It may still be the top one.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  I want to say that there also is,
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  these proposal is on the open source initiatives Wiki page.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  We have a Wiki page for it, it's on the Wiki site.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  And that is where all feedback on these proposed comments
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  should be placed.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  So I'm here, I'm going to take questions,
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  we'll have plenty of time to talk about it,
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  but in order to allow everybody to have,
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  see everybody's input and comments,
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  we are asking that all of the comments be added to the Wiki page.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  So if you have something here that you think is important,
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  in addition to hearing from it,
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  here I would also like you to take the time
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  to put it on the Wiki page so whether people can react to it.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  And the Wiki page is linked from the blog post.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  Again, I apologize about the links.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  So outside of the scope of this working group
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  and the OSD itself,
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  we did not discuss whether the OSD is appropriate
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  or not a conversation that comes up every so often.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  And we also didn't talk specifically about the tooling for the process.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  So at the moment we use an email listserv,
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  we have acknowledged for years that this is maybe not the best
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  type of technology to use for this process,
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  for the license review process, it's what we have now.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  The OSI has a parallel project of trying to identify
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  a better tooling system for taking in licenses,
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  asking for review, and giving feedback on those licenses,
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  and eventually making a decision.
[02:58.000 --> 03:03.000]  So what we did here and the tooling are obviously very interrelated
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  because if we want changes to the process,
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  that needs to be implemented in the tooling.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  So they do interact with each other,
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  but we stayed away from tooling and just assumed
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  that these issues could be handled and what we're going to do.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  So these were the questions that were proposed
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  for the licensing for the working group to work on.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  We're evaluating the criteria for approving licenses,
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  we're evaluating the process for considering licenses,
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  we're evaluating the current categories for licenses,
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  and evaluating whether there should be a process
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  for decertifying licenses.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  On the last one, we ended up not getting to that one
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  because when we got to that one, first off,
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  we had been taking a really long time,
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  and in looking at this last one, we realized that there were
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  many, many, many facts about the use of licenses
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  that might potentially be decertified that we didn't know,
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  and it would take a really long time to find those facts.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  So for example, what are the licenses that one might consider
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  decertifying? How are they being used?
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  What are the knock-on effects of removing that?
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  So for example, is there a business out there
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  that's marketing itself as an open-source company,
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  but we say, no, by the way,
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  we don't consider your license open-source anymore.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  What kind of impact is that going to have on that company?
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  What about companies that ingest licenses based on the fact
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  that they've been approved by the open-source initiative,
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  and we say, by the way, this one's not approved.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  How is that going to change their software stack?
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  So these were all things that we were completely in the dark about,
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  so that we took that off of the table for this group.
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  I would very much like to see another working group start
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  shortly to start working on that project,
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  because I think it is a valid project.
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  It just was something that we didn't have time for.
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  And frankly, I'm looking for someone else to lead that,
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  because I also continue to work on this piece of the project.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  Okay, I'll try to get done what we're going to see.
[05:10.000 --> 05:18.000]  So these were sort of some bigger picture things that we came up with.
[05:18.000 --> 05:25.000]  One was we agreed that the OSI will not be providing information,
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  recommendations that be providing advice on the use or adoption of the licenses.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  This is too fact-based.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  These choices about use and adoption of open-source licenses
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  is very specific to every project.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  It's very hard to generalize in a way that is helpful to anyone.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  This is an industry.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  There are people who do this as their business,
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  as to advise on adoption of open-source licenses.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  So the OSI is not going to be diving into that field.
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  What we will do in order to facilitate that
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  is we hope to provide machine-readable tags,
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  as well as licensed text.
[06:02.000 --> 06:07.000]  So providing API access to licensed text is a task that is underway.
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  We hope to provide machine-readable tags to go along with that
[06:12.000 --> 06:18.000]  in order to provide sort of more digestible information about these licenses.
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.000]  And again, I confess, you're all going to look at this and say,
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  there's a giant leap of faith.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  There are a couple of giant leaps of faith here,
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  and this is one of the giant leaps of faith,
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000]  and I'm looking to crowdsource both the identification of tags.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  We have a preliminary list.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  I don't think that that's novel to have identified some tags,
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  but to identify the tags.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  And also, I mean, there are more than 100 licenses,
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  so we need bodies to go through these licenses
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  to be able to identify what tags are appropriate for the licenses.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  Something like a tag might be, has a trace of venue provision.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  A tag might be copy left.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  A tag might be attribution requirement.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  A couple licenses don't have that, so they would be lacking those tags.
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  But to help with, you know, these licenses are all unique.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  So in some sense, I know that I always say I always go back
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  and read the license every single time,
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.000]  but certainly providing some sort of base-level information will be helpful.
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  We plan to have three categories of licenses, rejected, approved, and preferred.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  The word choices are up for discussion.
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.000]  The preferred is sort of the substitute for what is now called,
[07:38.000 --> 07:45.000]  and someone can help me, popular, something, something, a very interesting label.
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.000]  But we're hoping that the preferred tag will be objectively created
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  from data, hoping to find data on adoption metrics,
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  as well as using these tags as a filtering mechanism.
[08:00.000 --> 08:06.000]  So, you know, a license may have an attribute and still be an open-source license,
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  but it may not be sort of a preferred attribute for a license.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  So that, you know, and that's again sort of up for discussion on what are those tags
[08:15.000 --> 08:21.000]  that would, so it would be some combination of widespread adoption
[08:21.000 --> 08:27.000]  and, you know, a guaranteed level of sort of what the requirements are.
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  And we also will hope to provide more information to the public on the decision-making process.
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  It is a little bit of a mystery, particularly for people who haven't been on license review,
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.000]  sort of how, who gets to say how it works, we'll try to make that clear to people.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  So that's, those are larger concepts.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  We identified two different categories of licenses.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  This is, again, I think not terribly new concept, legacy licenses and new licenses.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  New licenses, by definition, anything that's not a legacy license.
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  And a legacy license is one, we've just sort of pinned as one that has been in use
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  for at least five years by more than 20 projects maintained by different unrelated entities.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  Again, up for discussion is 20 the right number? Is 100 the right number?
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  I don't know, but we're welcome feedback on sort of how do we know the point of a legacy license being,
[09:18.000 --> 09:27.000]  this is a license that is widely in use, but the OSI has not yet passed judgment on it on this license.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  So we want to capture those.
[09:29.000 --> 09:37.000]  So for all licenses, the submission process will, and some of these are old, you know, some of them are not,
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  some of them exist right now.
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  We will ask the submitter to affirmatively state that the license complies with the OSD,
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  including specifically affirming three, five, six and nine.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  That's because those are the ones that trip up people.
[09:50.000 --> 09:55.000]  I mean, we see licenses submitted where clearly the license submitter has never read the OSD.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  They just, you know, they just want to call it open source.
[09:58.000 --> 10:05.000]  Again, there's just a channeling function to just sort of put people through their paces on, did you really think about this?
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  Ask what projects are already using the license, the identity of the license steward, if known,
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  we'll try to get in touch with that person.
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.000]  Providing any additional information, sort of, you know, the fact that maybe Debian has said, has accepted this license
[10:19.000 --> 10:28.000]  would help inform our decision, gives a unique name, and again, some proposed tags for the license.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  This is, because we did not go into de-certifying licenses, instead, one of the rationales for de-certifying licenses is
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  that we get old licenses that would not now be approved, kind of thrown back at us and say,
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  well, you know, this was an open source license and it had this attribute.
[10:47.000 --> 10:54.000]  And so, we're just clearly stating that just because a license was approved in the past with a characteristic does not mean it will be approved again.
[10:54.000 --> 11:03.000]  So, that was the, so, so, this is for new licenses.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  So, I had what happened with legacy license or for all licenses.
[11:06.000 --> 11:15.000]  In addition for new licenses, the person submitting will describe what gap is not filled by a currently existing license.
[11:15.000 --> 11:23.000]  Compare it and contrast to the most similar, these already exist, describing illegal review the license has been through,
[11:23.000 --> 11:31.000]  but we have a new one, we have a new bullet here with the arrow, which is to provide examples of others potential use of the license
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  to demonstrate that it is not a license that is uniquely usable only by the license submitter.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  So, what we're looking for is we want licenses that are going to build community,
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  and so if you have a license that nobody will ever use, then that will be a hurdle to overcome.
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  Recommendations for approval of the licenses.
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  Again, I have three here that are, that have arrows next to that I think are new.
[11:59.000 --> 12:09.000]  So, we want to see a reusable license that the license can be used by any license or without changing the terms,
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  or that the license will achieve a different result for a different license or.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  So, it needs to function the same way no matter who adopts it.
[12:18.000 --> 12:25.000]  The license does not have terms that structurally put the license or in a more favored position than any licensee.
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.000]  So, again, this is a very even-handed, we're trying to build community here, not give anybody an advantage.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  I mean, I will say some of these are designed at ferreting out.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  Companies that are trying to get that moniker were open source, but they really have no intention of building community.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  They have no intention of having their software shared.
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  They just want to use this term as a marketing tool.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  So, that's what we're looking for.
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  The ambiguity must not have a material effect.
[12:58.000 --> 13:08.000]  There must be licenses that are, you know, a lot of them are not written in a way that is subject to clear legal interpretation.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  So, we want to, that we will take into account.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  It must be grammatically and syntactically clear to a speaker of the language of the license.
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  Every possible variation must meet the OSD.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  I've had, we had a recent one where it was sort of like, you know, two iterations were met the OSD,
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  but not four other iterations or four other, you know, sort of variables.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  Next bullet, it must be possible to comply with the license on submission.
[13:32.000 --> 13:43.000]  And the example, the counter example to this was the SSPL where I think Bradley pointed out that even MongoDB could not comply with the license itself.
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  It was the copyright owner and therefore didn't have to comply with the license.
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  But it was so, you know, but it was written in such a way that there was no one on earth could comply with the license.
[13:54.000 --> 14:00.000]  And then the license must fill a gap that currently existing licenses do not fill.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  So that's it.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  That's the, in a nutshell, again, you can go to the blog post and read sort of more detail about it.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  Put your comments on the wiki and I'm open for questions.
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  Okay, so, all right there.
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.000]  James here.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  I see James hands shut up.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  Interesting topic I guess.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  Yeah.
[14:25.000 --> 14:33.000]  Hi, how often do you see projects submitting license or people submitting licenses that projects are already using?
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  That seems like the cart before the horse.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  How often do we see licenses being submitted?
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  Oh, I mean, I think the, there was pretty often.
[14:43.000 --> 14:52.000]  So there, I frankly think that the, so the OSI's practice has been in the OSI's practice is we don't review a license unless someone submits it.
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  So there is a huge body of legacy licenses that nobody has bothered to submit to the OSI.
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.000]  So, you know, we have a little over 100 licenses have approved a little over 100 licenses.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  If you look at something like the Fedora project, I think they're in 400 licenses or something like that.
[15:09.000 --> 15:16.000]  So, so yeah, a lot of license, a lot of licenses you might expect are not there and submit away.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  Happy to, happy to have those included.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  Over here.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  Yeah.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  Hey, thank you for your talk.
[15:24.000 --> 15:38.000]  I was wondering if the working group or a related body has a part of a mandate to discourage license proliferation in general, or is it purely just about how to take the incoming licenses?
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  So I will respond to that sort of from my personal viewpoint.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  I'm trying to be clear that this is not the OSI's view.
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.000]  I will say that on the blog post, we will say that license, license proliferation, and I have the hardest time with that word.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  So if I may use a different word, because I can't say it, I think I'm not terribly concerned about it.
[15:59.000 --> 16:06.000]  I think it was very important that the OSI did put the kibosh on that many years ago.
[16:06.000 --> 16:13.000]  But I do believe that people are centering around licenses and that's why we're interested in sort of these preferred licenses.
[16:13.000 --> 16:19.000]  But I don't, we don't, you know, when open source first started there, everybody wanted to have their own license.
[16:19.000 --> 16:31.000]  But now I really think that people are cohesion around, around licenses and, and it's so that we're not seeing proliferation as a problem.
[16:31.000 --> 16:38.000]  But for again, they sort of, you know, the company that wants to have their own license so that they can say that they're open source.
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  So it's not, it's not the proliferation, it's the problem.
[16:41.000 --> 16:49.000]  It's the how they are, you know, why are they adopting these licenses and we want to make sure that they're being adopted for the, for the right reasons.
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.000]  Thank you.
[16:50.000 --> 16:53.000]  So two part question.
[16:53.000 --> 17:00.000]  Number one, you said reusable by any licensor or reusable by any of a class of licensor?
[17:00.000 --> 17:08.000]  Any of a class, yes, understanding their special purpose licenses that, but, but yes, and looking for reusability as, as the key.
[17:08.000 --> 17:15.000]  No, it doesn't have to be all purpose for all things reusable by, by the appropriate audience for that.
[17:15.000 --> 17:23.000]  But, but not, but not just that only the, only the person proposing the license or drafting the license is the only one who will conceivably use it.
[17:23.000 --> 17:30.000]  And the second, structurally favored, is the OSI going to take any position on CLAs and the use of, uses there up?
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  I, I don't recall what our position has been.
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  There are others in the room.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  I'm looking at others in the room who might know the answer to that.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  No, that's not, that's not on, we have never, we have never approved CLAs or opined on CLAs.
[17:42.000 --> 17:51.000]  And I'm not, I have not heard of anybody who thinks at the moment that that is something the OSI should be, will be doing.
[17:51.000 --> 18:00.000]  Can you take the slide back to the one that showed the comment about machine readable tags?
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  Let's see.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  This one?
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  Yes.
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  Okay.
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  I'll just comment that I agree that preferred sounds like it means preferred by the OSI.
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.000]  Right.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  So the OSI is recommending that people should use that as opposed to popular, which means that other people are using it.
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.000]  Yeah.
[18:20.000 --> 18:21.000]  I don't think that's going to change that.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  Put it on the wiki, please.
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  Going back to machine readable tags.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  That's a notoriously hard problem.
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.000]  Yeah.
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  You might need a controlled vocabulary for tagging.
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  Yes.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  And yes, it will be a controlled vocabulary for tagging.
[18:37.000 --> 18:49.000]  And you might need to make it very clear that the fact that you might need to distinguish between something, a license that has not been tagged because, with a particular tag, because no one's got around to it yet.
[18:49.000 --> 18:55.000]  Versus a license that has not been tagged because it negates the validity.
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  So we need a tag for tagged or not tagged.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  I know.
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  Or completely versus not yet fully tagged.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  Yeah.
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.000]  We only have a couple of minutes.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  I want to make sure James, who's hands shot up first, gets to ask his question.
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.000]  Okay.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  Yeah, I know.
[19:12.000 --> 19:13.000]  But I just, yeah.
[19:13.000 --> 19:14.000]  Okay.
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  So quick question as you said, changes to the criteria.
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.000]  They, I'm wondering if they're, they look to me the way you presented them as additions.
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  Is there things that you're subtracting from the existing criteria?
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  Oh, that's, that's a really, I will, next time I present, I will add that slide.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  No, it's, it's, it's, it's in addition to must meet the OSD.
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  Okay.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  So, but what are the existing criteria?
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  It's on the website.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  There's, yeah, there's an existing process on the OSI website right now.
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  Yeah.
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.000]  Yeah.
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  Thank you.
[19:45.000 --> 19:46.000]  Thank you for, thank you.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  That's why you do this, right?
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  Okay.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.000]  So the question I was going to ask is a variant about the no privileged entity one, because
[19:53.000 --> 19:59.000]  one of the ways of avoiding CLA's is to have a license that says, and this entity is, is
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.000]  empowered to change the terms of the license.
[20:02.000 --> 20:06.000]  Often done because for a new license, you don't quite know how well it will work out.
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  And you want an escape route if you want to go to an older license.
[20:10.000 --> 20:18.000]  If you keep that term and sort of, I'd have to swallow it if I were putting it close to
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  my mouth.
[20:19.000 --> 20:23.500]  So the question is, would there be certain privileged terms in the license that you would
[20:23.500 --> 20:29.000]  look favorably on if they're designed to perform a community function like being steward of whether
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.000]  the license should change?
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.000]  Because not doing that.
[20:33.000 --> 20:34.000]  Yeah.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  I'm not.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  Yeah.
[20:36.000 --> 20:41.000]  So the question, as I understand it is, are there terms that, that the OSI will look more
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  favorably on as sort of, you mean as getting into the preferred category or just more favorably
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  in the license review process?
[20:49.000 --> 20:53.000]  Basically allow an entity to change the license if something went wrong.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  That's what people usually use CLA store.
[20:55.000 --> 21:01.000]  And people have been gravitated through the licenses that made the entity instead, which
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  would run a file of your preferred entity.
[21:03.000 --> 21:09.000]  And to verify that sort of reusable and without change is, I would, I think that a name change
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  would be fine.
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  So for example, if, you know, if we said the license steward is who may come out with later
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  versions and making someone else a license steward, I think that that's something like
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  that.
[21:19.000 --> 21:25.000]  Just the name, just a hard coded name in there would be, I think that would not be objectionable.
[21:25.000 --> 21:32.000]  It was just, you know, sort of in something broader than that.
[21:32.000 --> 21:33.000]  Let's see.
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  You've got two minutes.
[21:35.000 --> 21:36.000]  Okay.
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  So you said the ambiguity must not have a material effect.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  I'm not real clear on what that means.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  I suspect there's, there's more reasoning behind that.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  Can you give an example or explain?
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  Yeah, I don't know if I can give an example, but materiality is a, is a, is a term that
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  all lawyers feel pretty comfortable with.
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  And the reason that we said without material effect is every license is imperfect.
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  So every license will have ambiguity.
[22:01.000 --> 22:06.000]  And very often you will not know what that is until down the road when someone discovers
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  that ambiguity.
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.000]  So material would be, I would say material, material, material change would be, it like
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  changes the effect of the license.
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  It's some interpretation that changes, that changes the meaning of the license so that
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.000]  there are two different ways that the license could be read because of this ambiguity.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  And that actually happens quite often.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  I would say every license has some kind of ambiguity.
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.000]  The question is whether it's so significant that it's going to create interpretation problems.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  And time's up.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  All right.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  Thank you very much.
