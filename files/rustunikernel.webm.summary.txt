The talk is about Rusty Hermit, a Rust-based Unikernel for micro-VMs focused on security. Rust was chosen for its modern features, safety, and thriving ecosystem. Rusty Hermit is tightly integrated with Rust and can easily port Rust-based applications to run on it. The presentation covers modularity, Rust's safe and unsafe features, and the team's plans for Rusty Hermit, including more modularization and rustifying the codebase. The project started as a research project, and while it hasn't been widely adopted in industry yet, they have partners in cloud and edge computing interested in using it. There are plans for RISC-V support and async support.
