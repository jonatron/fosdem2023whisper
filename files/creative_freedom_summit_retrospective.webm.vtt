WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
So we have Emma and Jess talking about what they learned about the creative freedom summit.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
So give a hand for them.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Hi everybody and welcome to our talk. We're very excited to be here at Fastem. It's the first time here.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
So very excited and nervous. Had a great time yesterday.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
So today we're just going to go through a summit that we hosted two weeks ago.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
We're going to explain what it is for people who weren't aware of it and then we're also going to see what went well and what could be improved.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
So just a small introduction first then. So my name is Emma Kidney.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm an associate software engineer at Red Hat in their community platform engineering team.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Kind of the last year. So I've kind of been more doing design work.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Kind of slowly doing more design work, less dev work.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm part of the Fedora design team and I utilize Floss in every aspect of my work.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
And an active member of the Fedora community.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
So I'll just pass it over to Jess then.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
So I'm Jess and so I joined the Red Hat team in 2022 as a Fedora community designer intern.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
For the community platform engineering group.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
And I've got all open source software, Inkscape, Penpart of course.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
And just loads of other ones and creating numerous logos for the Fedora project as well that you might have seen around.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Includes.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
So yeah, so a little bit of the creative freedom summit.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
It was a summit that we held, was it two weeks ago?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah, two weeks ago.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah, so it was all over like Jitsie and PeerTube.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
And it's just, again, promoting loads of creative software that people might know about.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
So yeah, basically, yeah, what is the creative freedom summit?

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
So it's a virtual event focused on promoting open source tools,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
spreading knowledge of how to use them and connecting creatives across the FOSS ecosystem.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
So the summit's accomplishments and shortcomings will be examined in light of the first year.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
So the primary goals for this were, of course, promote open source creative software.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
And also spreading knowledge of how to use it.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
So it's very important like there's so many free software that people don't know about

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
and it's great to give them that recognition.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
And also connecting creatives across the FOSS ecosystem.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
So other people who use these open source software can connect with each other and share ideas and all that sort of stuff.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
And then our secondary goals were to promote the Fedora design team as well as a welcoming group.

03:00.000 --> 03:09.000
So, you know, especially if you don't have a platform to show off like what you've done on open source software,

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
you can always join the Fedora design team.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
We also create a potential onboarding path for new design contributors as well

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
and spread info on how to use the creative open source tools in communities.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So again, same as the last one.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
So showing how the Fedora design team will tools to make communities stuff happen

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
and have sessions like how the Fedora design team do this, that and the other

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
and hoping make sense for easier for people to get involved.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
So what topics do we cover?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
So again, pen path.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
So if you don't know what it is, if you missed the first talk, it's a web-based design and prototyping platform.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Inkscape as well, which I love.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
And powerful, it's a vector-based graphics editor.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
Blender, Krita and Caden live, I assume you might have went to the KDE stand that was around.

04:10.000 --> 04:19.000
And GIMP and also accessibility as well, which is very important in the design aspect of things,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
like color blindness pallets and stuff like that.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
And then the free software was actually, it's like free patterns for different crafts.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
So more kind of a hands-on design thing rather than technical.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
And creative professional using open-source software.

04:37.000 --> 04:45.000
So we had some people as well who, and of course us as well, like using free open-source in a professional aspect.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
And many others.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
So we had an amazing line-up of speakers, so Maureen Duffy and David Revoy to name a few.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
And we had social hours that include the audience and help build a sense of community.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
So some of these include a hack and craft, which is kind of like the free software.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
It's by the same person, Morgan Lemmerweber.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
And so we were basically, like for the hack and craft, we were all like knitting and making sewing things,

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
but also talking about open-source and Pictionary and Gartik Phone.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
So it was really fun.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
And then, of course, wouldn't be possible without our sponsors.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
So Fedora and Red Hat were the main sponsors.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
And then the platforms we used to share was Wee's Element.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
So like people could interact in the chat.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Jitsie was for the live streaming part.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh, sorry.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Jitsie was the video part.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
So we all went into a call, and then Peerchu was the live streaming part of it.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
So, yeah, I'm going to hand you over to Emma for the retrospective.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Nice.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Okay.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
So just some details then as well.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
So when it took place, as Jess said, around two weeks ago, January 17th to the 19th.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
What platform?

06:03.000 --> 06:11.000
We used Jitsie, streamed with Peerchu, and then Element and Matrix were used for the audience to interact with each other and the speakers.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
What if you didn't make it?

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
The recordings are available on the Create Freedom Summit's Peerchu.

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
And we'll soon be uploaded to the Fedora YouTube when editing is complete, where we have some great contributors at the minute,

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
converting the raw video files over into properly caught and published talks.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And was there a badge?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
The important question when an event is run by Fedora.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yes, there was a badge.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
It was designed by Jess, again.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
And it was able to be claimed by anyone with Fedora badges account.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
And it was claimed around 48 times, I believe.

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
And also, if you're wondering why we had a badge, the summit was all about promoting open source design.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
And then obviously, as the Fedora design team, there can be a lot of overlap then between the two communities.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Here's just an example of what the setup looked like if you were to attend the summit.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
So at the top there, you have a little widget for the live stream.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
And we have another little kind of notepad feature there where you can type out any questions you might have,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
some information kind of frequently asked questions.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
And then we have the chat there then so people can interact with each other.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
And also the background channel for the talk.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Oh, yeah.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Oh, yeah, because if you wanted to just watch the talk and I've been involved in the chat room,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
you just watch directly with the PeerTube link as well.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
So the event go went very well.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
We had 18 speakers take part with an average of 50 viewers per session, which is very good for our first time round.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
We had more than 700 unique viewers spread out across 54 different countries.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
And in the element chat room, we came up to around 250 members.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
So we were kind of aiming for 100 in the element chat room, but so the fact we kind of double that grade.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
So what went well? Viewers loved the setup we had.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
They were able to watch videos soon after they were live as well, due to the system that we were using.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
And the chat room was very friendly and there was a real strong sense of community there.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
And the audience had a lot of back and forth with the speakers as well.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
There was a lot of interactions at the social events and a lot of interest.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
Also no code of conduct issues, which is always nice.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
So we got to see some amazing work.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
So we had some speed painting sessions there with grease pencil and blender.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
It's been painting with Krita, an inkscape tutorial.

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
There's a software blender as well. There was a good few things about blender.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So what can we improve for next year?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
So what didn't work?

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
We want to try and create a guide for next year with guidance on how to use the platform.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Because from a newbie perspective, if you're not familiar with matrix element,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
or that kind of thing, it can be a bit foreign, a bit hard to get into.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
We also need to look into auto captions then as well.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
Since we used jitsy and pure tube, we did not have live captions during the summit.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
We were able to add them in post-production, but it would have been nice to have it while the event was happening.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
So we're going to look into some open source tools that can be used alongside jitsy.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
Hopefully we can stick with that arrangement and then, if not, maybe look into some alternatives.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
So what's next then?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
So call for proposals.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
So depending on speaker capacity and interest, we'll probably do a call for proposals

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
around two to three months prior to the event.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
There's a lot of interest in the audience to get involved themselves, present their own talks,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
and share their knowledge.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
We want to keep group and interaction growing throughout the year.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
This can bring more people into the community, maintain their interests,

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
so maybe have socials, our challenges, kind of little, mini events.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Spread the word, so participate in talks like this one.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
Kind of get involved in more of the open source design forms, all the different communities.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
Planning is a major part, so we're going to give ourselves some more time to implement improvements,

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
try some things out, and then if any areas come up.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
So yeah, I'm going to pass you over to Jess, then, just in case you're interested in participating in Fedora.

10:32.000 --> 10:40.000
So a little bit of a segue, I suppose, since we're all, it's very heavily supported by the Fedora design team,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
so if you would like to be interested in the next one.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
So if you would like to, there's a Fedora account that you can create.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
You can create it at accounts.fedoraproduct.org.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
And you can use it to sign in to the element as well.

10:55.000 --> 11:04.000
And it's very kind of, it's like the main account to use, especially with a somewhat like this.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
So if you want to learn more about Fedora, it's all on the Fedora docs.

11:08.000 --> 11:15.000
And also if you do join.fedoraproduct.org, it gives you all the links that you can use as well.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
It shows our missions, our foundations, all the user documentation.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
And you can look us up and ping us if you need anything.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
And then also, yeah, you can hang out with us.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
So in the element chat, we have a Fedora design element chat and people share what they've been contributing.

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
And if anyone needs feedback from like the more senior people or like just in general,

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
it's a really good place to be, Fedora marketing as well.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
And there's many more channels as well, even if you're not really interested in design, there's infrastructure,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
there's many more loads.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
So, and yeah, where to find us.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
So the matrix channel there, creativefreedom.dot.fedora.im.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
And then our website is creativefreedom.com where you can get all the information.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
And we have, like when we were playing it as well, we had all of our,

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
we had a live schedule going on and you can click on it and it brings you to the streams.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
And then again, the Fedora design team matrix channel is there.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
And then that's us.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
So if you have any questions.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
Yeah, so we're planning on making it kind of like an annual event.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
So it'll hopefully happen in around January next year as well.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
So feel free to enter the matrix channel, ping myself or Jess.

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
I'm more than happy to punch in the right direction if you're not sure on how to use matrix or element, anything like that.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
So yeah, I think that's our talk.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
Thank you.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Does anyone have any questions?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
No.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Yes.

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
Do you plan to keep that format for the future?

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah, because it's, I suppose it's making open source design tools kind of more accessible.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
So we'd like to kind of keep it a virtual event, I think for the foreseeable future.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Maybe there might be some mini events, things like that.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
We haven't really discussed it, but we do like the online aspect that, you know, anyone can join.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
So it is, yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah, I suppose.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah, just making it more accessible for people.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.000
Does anyone else have any questions?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
Would you like to see more of the next one?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
So I'll just repeat the question.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
So we were just asked, what would we like to see more of in the next summit?

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
So I suppose, just getting the numbers off.

14:07.000 --> 14:15.000
Well, you know, like it's good to see, you know, just make it more, well, it is approachable, I suppose.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
But I don't know.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
That's a tough question.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
I'd like to see more of like the craft inside a thing and the open source design aspect,

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
because I thought that was really interesting when Morgan came in and was talking about having, you know,

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
open source design, say, of like sewing patterns, things like that,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
making clothing more accessible to people.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
It was kind of an aspect of design I didn't really think of,

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
even though I'm into like crocheting and knitting and stuff myself.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
So it was mad just to kind of see like a hobby and like work kind of come together then.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
So I thought that was quite interesting.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah, I'd like to see more of that.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Anyone else?

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Okay. Yeah, we also have a stand-down in building H as well.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
So we'll probably be there after this.

15:04.000 --> 15:28.000
Thank you.
