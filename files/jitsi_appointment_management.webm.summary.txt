The talk presented a seamless integration of easy appointments, an online software platform for appointment management, and Jitsi, an open-source teleconferencing project, into a single platform for booking online appointments. The talk also introduced the GeForce Open Technologies Alliance, a non-profit organization promoting open standards, technologies, and content, with several thematic working groups. The presented prototype utilized minimal changes from the original easy appointment source code and generated a unique Jitsi link for each appointment.
