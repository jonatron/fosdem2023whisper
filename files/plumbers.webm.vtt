WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.920
So, it's been a while since I've been in FOSDEM and one of the things that, well, I

00:12.920 --> 00:19.000
usually talk about technical topics, but this is really me talking about sort of using open

00:19.000 --> 00:25.160
source instead of producing it, which is quite an unusual position for me to be in.

00:25.160 --> 00:33.200
I work most often in things like the Linux kernel, I also work in open source politics,

00:33.200 --> 00:37.960
so I did a lot of kernel interaction with the Linux foundation and one of those pieces

00:37.960 --> 00:43.040
of interaction was actually being a founding member of Linux Plumbers conference, which

00:43.040 --> 00:50.040
is the conference we'll actually be talking about for this presentation.

00:50.040 --> 00:54.800
Plumbers was basically founded in 2008 as an in-person conference and it's always been

00:54.800 --> 00:59.040
an in-person conference up to the pandemic years.

00:59.040 --> 01:03.840
It's actually organized somewhat similarly to FOSDEM in that it has tracks and what are

01:03.840 --> 01:05.760
called microconferences.

01:05.760 --> 01:10.520
The microconferences are similar to dev rooms except they're really a bit more interactive,

01:10.520 --> 01:14.840
so they're really expected to do participant conversations and usually you get a cluster

01:14.840 --> 01:20.600
of people at the front talking to each other.

01:20.600 --> 01:26.080
The tracks themselves when we have them mostly tend to be presentations, so very like this,

01:26.080 --> 01:30.280
but the microconferences tend to be very discussion based.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.080
If you think about trying to do that sort of hybrid and online, you realize you need

01:34.080 --> 01:39.440
some sort of highly interactive video system, which is what we went through.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.160
One of the good things we had for Plumbers is that the conference actually produces quite

01:44.160 --> 01:45.480
a lot of money.

01:45.480 --> 01:52.000
We have quite a lot of sponsorship, so it's quite easy to pay people to do things in the

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
conference.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.960
One of the things we paid for in 2018 was to actually make the conference live streaming

01:57.960 --> 02:03.440
for all of those who couldn't attend and also to try and put all of the videos of every

02:03.440 --> 02:07.880
presentation and every discussion we had up on the website.

02:07.880 --> 02:13.360
Obviously to do that, we needed to pay somebody to run AV in each of our rooms and Plumbers

02:13.360 --> 02:18.960
tends to run as about somewhere between four and eight simultaneous tracks.

02:18.960 --> 02:24.800
We needed about 16 cameras to do this and about between four and eight people to stay

02:24.800 --> 02:30.160
in the room to also do it.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.680
Obviously this then included provision of cameras in the rooms.

02:33.680 --> 02:38.720
The way we set up cameras at Plumbers is slightly different from what you have here because in

02:38.720 --> 02:43.280
your setup, the camera is mostly looking down at me because you think I should be the

02:43.280 --> 02:48.120
focus of attention, which is true because I'm giving the talk.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.920
When you're actually trying to record an ongoing live discussion that mostly happens

02:52.920 --> 02:57.360
between people in the audience, you also need the people who are live streaming to be able

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
to see it.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.720
One of the other fortuitous things is Plumbers is always set up with two cameras, one at

03:02.720 --> 03:08.440
the back looking down on the speaker and then one at the front looking out at the audience.

03:08.440 --> 03:13.040
The AV guys are actually responsible for switching between the front view and the back view so

03:13.040 --> 03:17.400
that when we start to get conversations within the audience, the camera can actually catch

03:17.400 --> 03:19.960
them and you can watch it.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.480
This actually turned out to be really fortuitous as well.

03:23.480 --> 03:29.080
Obviously, when you try and record your conference, the first thing you realize is that in a highly

03:29.080 --> 03:34.360
interactive conference, most people don't use the microphone and it's really annoying

03:34.360 --> 03:39.520
for everybody on the streaming when you get a load of silence in the room.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.960
Getting people to use microphones is one of the key things that you have to do when

03:43.960 --> 03:45.640
you start recording your conference.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.440
This is still nothing to do with trying to get it live or hybrid.

03:49.440 --> 03:53.320
This is just recording the conference.

03:53.320 --> 03:59.480
You have to persuade all participants in the conversation to actually use a microphone.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.400
However much money your conference makes, you will only have a few microphones.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.560
This one, we have two microphones at the front.

04:05.560 --> 04:11.280
I have one Le Valier microphone for a room that could possibly seat over a thousand people.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.760
Trying to run around with microphones when you're doing an interactive conversation is

04:14.760 --> 04:18.840
really difficult as I assume the guys with orange t-shirts will be able to tell you over

04:18.840 --> 04:21.720
a beer after the event.

04:21.720 --> 04:27.160
The solution we took was borrowed from another conference in Paris called Colonel Recipes,

04:27.160 --> 04:33.200
which are these things called catch boxes and effectively they're square plastic polystyrene

04:33.200 --> 04:38.080
blobs that have a microphone inside that you can throw from one end of a conference room

04:38.080 --> 04:39.200
to another.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.920
This gives you a way of actually getting the microphone between the participants very

04:42.920 --> 04:50.640
fast and it's definitely fun to use and they do encourage participation.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.680
So far we've had no injuries.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.520
I should actually qualify.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.240
We've actually had no serious injuries so far with people throwing microphones at each

04:58.240 --> 04:59.240
other.

04:59.240 --> 05:04.760
I assume there's always a first time.

05:04.760 --> 05:09.920
The idea was really to try and make the conference that we were running available in real time

05:09.920 --> 05:14.680
to people who can't participate because it's a current development conference.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.840
We get people who want to come from all over the globe.

05:17.840 --> 05:22.160
We always have corners of the globe, especially when we run the conference in America, that

05:22.160 --> 05:25.280
even if they have the best will in the world and they can actually scrape up the money

05:25.280 --> 05:28.880
to come, they're often denied visas by the US authority.

05:28.880 --> 05:33.600
So it can be a really difficult problem.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.280
And for our first attempts at doing this, the communication was really only outbound.

05:38.280 --> 05:42.440
So the remote participants could watch what was going on in the room but they couldn't

05:42.440 --> 05:45.800
really participate.

05:45.800 --> 05:53.240
And obviously this all changed in 2000 when we got to the pandemic years.

05:53.240 --> 05:58.200
Like all other conferences, plumbers moved to being fully online.

05:58.200 --> 06:03.400
We were actually in the year 2000, we already booked a venue up in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

06:03.400 --> 06:07.720
We had a huge amount of fun trying to get out of that venue contract when it emerged

06:07.720 --> 06:10.240
that we couldn't actually hold the conference up there.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.680
And then we all had to scramble to try and actually do this fully online.

06:14.680 --> 06:20.360
So this is where the story becomes quite interesting because there are 10 people on Plumbers Committee.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.120
Mike Rappaport over here is one of them.

06:23.120 --> 06:29.040
Because of the origin, we are primarily kernel developers and because we're moving fully

06:29.040 --> 06:34.120
online, effectively, kernel developers are becoming responsible for web programming.

06:34.120 --> 06:39.280
Because what we're really doing is setting up a distributed set of web services.

06:39.280 --> 06:46.000
And if you know kernel developers, we mostly tend to theoretically look down on web developers

06:46.000 --> 06:50.280
because obviously the kernel development is at the hardcore of everything.

06:50.280 --> 06:56.040
So this is somewhat a story of how a bunch of kernel developers tried to do web and

06:56.040 --> 07:05.320
failed a bit, screwed up quite a lot and eventually got it working by the seat of their pants.

07:05.320 --> 07:10.760
We evaluated a load of options for actually going fully online as every conference did.

07:10.760 --> 07:15.240
They scrambled to, we discussed it a lot with other conferences.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.840
People had different ideas.

07:16.840 --> 07:21.720
We were actually under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation and there are much more commercial

07:21.720 --> 07:22.840
entity than we are.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.680
We're still a volunteer run, even pulling a lot of money.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.000
That idea was just to pay somebody to do the solutions.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.320
And frankly, in the early days, that looked like a good idea to us.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.360
If you can just pay money to get rid of the problem, why wouldn't you?

07:38.360 --> 07:40.480
And we have enough money.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.480
We've got almost a million dollars in the bank now for Plumbers.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.560
We could afford to spend a lot of that money to actually pay for somebody to sort out these

07:48.560 --> 07:49.960
problems.

07:49.960 --> 07:53.600
And the Linux Foundation tried to do it for several conferences and we looked at their

07:53.600 --> 07:55.880
solution and went, you know, this is terrible.

07:55.880 --> 08:01.680
I mean, why is it so difficult and so bad trying to run a conference?

08:01.680 --> 08:08.080
And so the only way we could actually foresee getting this working is if we just abandoned

08:08.080 --> 08:13.680
all of the commercial solutions and did it ourselves, which is much more difficult than

08:13.680 --> 08:16.600
we imagined to actually do.

08:16.600 --> 08:21.800
But the goal of this was that we definitely needed, in our online conference, to have

08:21.800 --> 08:25.800
two-way video interaction in real time between the participants.

08:25.800 --> 08:26.800
That was the goal.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.040
And there was no real conference system that did that.

08:30.040 --> 08:34.120
If you've tried holding conferences over Zoom, you can just about do it.

08:34.120 --> 08:39.040
But things like BBB actually do an awful lot better than this.

08:39.040 --> 08:44.360
And the other thing we discovered is that when you're running a collection of web services,

08:44.360 --> 08:47.680
it really is all about the integrations.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.360
Open Source gives you a lot of excellent pieces.

08:50.360 --> 08:55.600
So we use Big Blue Button, we use Indico for the conference scheduling, eventually we use

08:55.600 --> 08:59.560
Matrix for the Trap, we didn't use it in the first year.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.760
But there's also a downside to that.

09:01.760 --> 09:06.800
Whenever you try and integrate web services, you always write a set of glue around them

09:06.800 --> 09:09.680
that needs to be maintained.

09:09.680 --> 09:13.560
And if there are a load of disparate services that aren't used to talking to each other,

09:13.560 --> 09:16.640
it does the impedance matching between the services.

09:16.640 --> 09:21.360
And as the years go by, and remember this is a conference, so you put it on once a year,

09:21.360 --> 09:25.400
every year you upgrade to the new versions and suddenly your glue doesn't work again.

09:25.400 --> 09:32.480
So it always becomes a maintenance nightmare to get the glue working.

09:32.480 --> 09:38.600
So if you ever came to the Plumber's Conference, the web front end that you first see, if you

09:38.600 --> 09:44.960
go to meet.lpc.events, is a piece of code that John Corbett wrote in Python and Django

09:44.960 --> 09:49.680
called the Linux Plumber's Front End, LPCFE.

09:49.680 --> 09:54.640
Oh, and I should add that these things here are clickable URLs.

09:54.640 --> 09:59.320
So if you go to the presentation and you want to know where it is, you can just hover over

09:59.320 --> 10:01.800
it and it will tell you.

10:01.800 --> 10:07.480
But obviously the green light is actually the way you log people onto BBB.

10:07.480 --> 10:13.720
So by replacing green light and big blue button, we've effectively taken on the job

10:13.720 --> 10:20.160
ourselves of doing integration, authentication, user management, and pretty much everything

10:20.160 --> 10:21.160
else.

10:21.160 --> 10:26.600
This is actually a major replacement of services on big blue button.

10:26.600 --> 10:31.280
And the reason we did this is because we needed an integration with our conference timetable.

10:31.280 --> 10:35.080
We just wanted the conference timetable to display on the first screen with a little

10:35.080 --> 10:37.720
button that said, click here to go to this session.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.120
It's very like you have in FOSDAM with the matrix chat.

10:41.120 --> 10:45.280
If you just click on the integration of the matrix chat, it brings up the live stream

10:45.280 --> 10:47.440
and you can see what's going on in the conference.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.120
We wanted it to work pretty much as it does here.

10:51.120 --> 10:55.520
And green light just wouldn't do that for us because green light was designed to be

10:55.520 --> 10:58.240
a teaching front end for a single classroom.

10:58.240 --> 11:08.720
It wasn't really thinking about multiple tracks, multiple track rooms, and timetable integration.

11:08.720 --> 11:16.680
So we also, by getting rid of all of the attendee credentials, we actually had to integrate

11:16.680 --> 11:20.440
with some sort of authentication server that could be distributed.

11:20.440 --> 11:25.040
So being kernel developers, we chose LDAT because it's the oldest one and it's the one

11:25.040 --> 11:26.860
everybody has the most trouble with.

11:26.860 --> 11:30.920
So we should be able to use it, right?

11:30.920 --> 11:34.760
The credentials were the email address that you used to register with the conference,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.480
which is easy.

11:36.480 --> 11:41.280
And the password was just the confirmation number because fortunately the Linux Foundation

11:41.280 --> 11:45.600
CVent system spits out these long confirmation numbers and they're all guaranteed to be

11:45.600 --> 11:46.600
unique.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.160
So that's obviously really easy.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.680
Problem, again, integration.

11:51.680 --> 11:55.720
The CVent system will not speak to anything outside CVent.

11:55.720 --> 12:03.240
So if you register for the conference and you don't automatically show up in the LDAT

12:03.240 --> 12:08.320
database, what has to happen is I have to go to the CVent website and export a spreadsheet

12:08.320 --> 12:13.720
of all of the users, figure out which are new ones, and then feed the details into the

12:13.720 --> 12:18.680
LDAT server, which, I mean, as an offline activity, it sounds really simple.

12:18.680 --> 12:23.480
It becomes really complicated when you keep getting people who don't register into the

12:23.480 --> 12:28.640
last minute of the conference, turn up halfway through a session, want to register, and then

12:28.640 --> 12:31.720
immediately be able to see what the hell's going on.

12:31.720 --> 12:36.480
And they have to wait, I don't know how long, for somebody to actually put their credentials

12:36.480 --> 12:37.480
in the database.

12:37.480 --> 12:41.520
And when you're running a conference, pretty much all of your attendees are running around

12:41.520 --> 12:44.880
– or all of your organizers are running around full-time.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.480
Nobody has time to tend the back end of the database.

12:47.480 --> 12:51.960
And that became a bottleneck for certain people.

12:51.960 --> 12:58.640
So my request of you is if you ever get into this situation, register early, please, don't

12:58.640 --> 13:01.160
turn up at the last minute, it's much easier.

13:01.160 --> 13:08.120
Then the next problem is that nobody is actually really used to interacting online.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.520
I mean, you think it's easy, you've seen Zoom calls, you will just turn up and you've

13:11.520 --> 13:14.000
got, you know, pictures of each other on it.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.240
If you try and do that with 800 people, Zoom doesn't really do autofocus very well.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.760
You can't see who's talking.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.640
And if you're just observing the conference, it just becomes a mass of faces and it's

13:25.640 --> 13:28.680
completely useless.

13:28.680 --> 13:33.560
So we obviously had standard issues like good webcam, good microphone.

13:33.560 --> 13:39.200
The number of people probably among you sitting in this room who think that the standard set

13:39.200 --> 13:43.360
of speakers on your Dell system when you just open the laptop will do when you're chatting

13:43.360 --> 13:46.000
to each other, believe me, it won't.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.280
The thing that audiences hate the most in online conferences is static background noise,

13:52.280 --> 13:55.280
indistinctness, being unable to get the point across.

13:55.280 --> 14:00.680
If you don't have in the attendees who are going to interact good AV equipment, this

14:00.680 --> 14:05.560
is the thing which actually makes the conference experience go down the fastest.

14:05.560 --> 14:11.160
This is about the only thing we got right because we gave a speaker gifts designed to

14:11.160 --> 14:16.520
be delivered to anywhere in the world a month before the conference, a complete gift pack

14:16.520 --> 14:22.040
of headset lights so you could actually see the face and a webcam you could put on the

14:22.040 --> 14:26.480
top of your camera, a 1080p webcam so we were sure that we'd actually have a good view of

14:26.480 --> 14:27.640
the speakers.

14:27.640 --> 14:33.240
We made sure that they got to all of our nearly 100 speakers in the conference and most of

14:33.240 --> 14:37.680
them didn't use them, which was a bit of a problem.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.640
We also found, as I've explained with Zoom, that raised hands don't work and having a

14:41.640 --> 14:46.800
load of people on video who you have no idea what's going on doesn't work either.

14:46.800 --> 14:51.600
The thing we pioneered for plumbers is called video muting, which is where we try and instruct

14:51.600 --> 14:56.480
the attendees to, if you're just watching, don't turn your camera on.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.120
Pretty much it's a blank screen.

14:58.120 --> 15:02.000
The only people who turn their camera on are people who are talking or people who are waiting

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
to talk.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.640
It actually gives a good visual clue that somebody wants to interject at this point.

15:07.640 --> 15:12.480
We found it was actually a reasonably good way of facilitating interaction in an online

15:12.480 --> 15:17.280
conference and it certainly solves the Zoom confusion where you just can't figure out

15:17.280 --> 15:22.520
who's talking to whom on your screen of, and for the online conference we did have about

15:22.520 --> 15:24.080
900 attendees.

15:24.080 --> 15:31.080
You could imagine on a Zoom screen everybody would probably get about five pixels.

15:31.080 --> 15:36.600
In 2020, Big Blue Button comes with an internal chat system, which means anybody logged into

15:36.600 --> 15:41.480
Big Blue Button can pop out a chat tab at the side and they'll be able to chat with

15:41.480 --> 15:44.400
anybody who's logged into the conference.

15:44.400 --> 15:49.080
This is why, if you were doing streaming of the conference, you couldn't interact because

15:49.080 --> 15:53.680
that is a completely enclosed chat system.

15:53.680 --> 15:58.760
We realized that people wanted to have conversations outside the discussion rooms as well, things

15:58.760 --> 16:00.400
like hallway tracks.

16:00.400 --> 16:05.040
We actually adopted a, it's a sort of open source project called Rocket Chat.

16:05.040 --> 16:09.800
The core of the project is fully open sourced, but Rocket Chat themselves runs a more open

16:09.800 --> 16:14.320
core model where there are certain enterprise upsells and everything, but this was just

16:14.320 --> 16:16.240
the one we came across.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.480
The good thing for us is it doesn't require any integration because we'd already started

16:20.480 --> 16:25.440
to realize the more integrations you do, the more difficulty you have, the more strings

16:25.440 --> 16:30.920
and bailing wire stuff there is to go wrong at the crunch time when you put the conference

16:30.920 --> 16:31.920
on.

16:31.920 --> 16:36.200
So no integration looked like a good thing until we tried to run the conference.

16:36.200 --> 16:41.280
And then the problems were that chat was hard to read on the live stream because we're

16:41.280 --> 16:44.640
streaming it out pretty much through YouTube.

16:44.640 --> 16:49.240
We actually, Gilou Nadi wrote a streaming module for BVB and we just plugged it in as

16:49.240 --> 16:53.400
an additional attendee and what it saw is what we streamed to YouTube.

16:53.400 --> 16:58.840
And the problem is that YouTube does dynamic compression of most of the stuff while it's

16:58.840 --> 16:59.840
streaming.

16:59.840 --> 17:04.560
And if you have a low bandwidth connection, it will quite happily greek all of the chat

17:04.560 --> 17:11.120
that's going on and you just can't see what is going on on the chat, whereas if it's sort

17:11.120 --> 17:16.480
of having a bandwidth problem with faces and you're just looking at lips moving, you can

17:16.480 --> 17:23.080
stand losing quite a few pixels, but if you're trying to follow chat, it's just impossible.

17:23.080 --> 17:27.800
And obviously streamers didn't have any credentials to the Rocket Chat anyway because we based

17:27.800 --> 17:31.840
on our LDAP, if you're not registered to the conference, you have no chat credentials.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.160
So they couldn't join the hallway track either, which they didn't like.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.800
This was the problem.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.560
And the third problem was we had to buy an enterprise license from Rocket Chat actually

17:40.560 --> 17:46.400
to get some of the notifications that we used for integration to work.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.400
And the two chat systems were completely and fully disconnected.

17:50.400 --> 17:55.440
So you couldn't use your Rocket Chat login to look at the BBB chat and vice versa, which

17:55.440 --> 18:00.000
also was a bit balkanizing and a bit annoying for people.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.320
And so you can see that the thing I initially portrayed as a huge advantage because we didn't

18:04.320 --> 18:08.920
have to worry about the integration was the thing that everybody found the biggest disadvantage

18:08.920 --> 18:11.680
about the conference because it wasn't integrated.

18:11.680 --> 18:16.480
So you always get this pressure of, and you know as conference organizers, the more integration

18:16.480 --> 18:20.200
you do, the more chance there is that something will go wrong.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.120
But if you don't do enough integration, your audience don't like it.

18:24.120 --> 18:28.560
So you have to get the amount of integration right.

18:28.560 --> 18:33.520
And for several conferences, we actually struggled to do this.

18:33.520 --> 18:40.800
Every registered attendee got a matrix ID, and since we used email and confirmation number

18:40.800 --> 18:45.080
to log in, we figured we'd just use email address matrix as well.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.800
But there's a slight problem here.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.760
Emails contain an at sign.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.920
Matrix does not like additional at signs in your ID.

18:51.920 --> 18:56.120
So we had to replace the at sign with a full stop, which I thought, oh, it could be easy

18:56.120 --> 18:57.280
for our attendees.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.280
They're all computer geeks.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.280
They'll get this.

18:59.280 --> 19:03.600
They'll know email address for one server, email address but with at sign substituted

19:03.600 --> 19:07.320
with dot for another server, complete disaster.

19:07.320 --> 19:11.480
You know, they just couldn't figure out which ID correctly to use for which.

19:11.480 --> 19:17.200
Eventually we got the BBB server to use either form of the address.

19:17.200 --> 19:21.440
And we actually got the matrix server to translate using a JavaScript widget.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.520
If they typed in the email address, it would just fill in the dot and everything would

19:24.520 --> 19:25.520
just work.

19:25.520 --> 19:31.920
We tried it without doing that for a couple of days and got a bucketful of complaints.

19:31.920 --> 19:40.160
I should also add that when we chose Rocket Chat in 2020, I wasn't very happy about the

19:40.160 --> 19:45.080
decision because I was a fledgling matrix user, and I was sure that matrix could handle

19:45.080 --> 19:49.780
the conference, and I thought it would actually be a good idea to do this.

19:49.780 --> 19:54.200
So I advocated even in 2020 that we should be using matrix.

19:54.200 --> 20:00.480
And finally, after all the difficulty with Rocket Chat in 2021, I got my wish.

20:00.480 --> 20:06.320
So they told me, we're using matrix and you're in charge, which was fun until the first day

20:06.320 --> 20:13.000
came along and the matrix server with 900 people on it just fell over.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.680
And we had actually done scaling testing.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.880
I mean, I'm not naive.

20:15.880 --> 20:21.360
I know things can go wrong at scale that you don't see in your own lab.

20:21.360 --> 20:26.920
So we'd invited everybody to come along for a town hall, but only 100 people showed up.

20:26.920 --> 20:30.560
And it turned out that most of the scaling problems we had were somewhere between 100

20:30.560 --> 20:31.640
and 900.

20:31.640 --> 20:37.960
So we hadn't hit any of them in our little test.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.040
And I'd also tried to scale up the matrix server.

20:41.040 --> 20:48.520
So our massive 16 CPU system that we were paying about $100 a month for, when you ran

20:48.520 --> 20:53.320
top on it was only using one CPU because I hadn't realized that matrix Synapse, which

20:53.320 --> 20:56.360
was the server we chose, was single-threaded.

20:56.360 --> 21:01.600
I mean, who in 2021 writes a single-threaded web application?

21:01.600 --> 21:07.360
But the matrix people thread matrix by using the back-end web server through a sequence

21:07.360 --> 21:11.800
of proxies to actually do this, but that is not the default configuration.

21:11.800 --> 21:17.520
And so on the Monday of the conference, I was left there in my own little basement sweating

21:17.520 --> 21:20.240
away going, how the hell do I scale this thing?

21:20.240 --> 21:25.640
But fortunately, several people who attended FOSDEM, which did use matrix before we did,

21:25.640 --> 21:26.640
also ran into this problem.

21:26.640 --> 21:31.200
And they were able to send me email saying, yeah, we've got this guy you can talk to.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.520
He'll teach you how to do it.

21:32.520 --> 21:39.440
So fortunately, within about four hours of discovering the problem and realizing it didn't

21:39.440 --> 21:43.160
scale, we had a roughly scaling matrix server working.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.240
And I managed to actually complete the scaling by the end of the first day.

21:47.240 --> 21:51.560
So for the second day, matrix was actually fully functional, fortunately, since it was

21:51.560 --> 21:54.240
my little baby.

21:54.240 --> 21:58.760
And I actually did a little blog post about how we got this to work, just so if anybody

21:58.760 --> 22:02.840
else ever runs into the problems, there are online resources to go to to get yourselves

22:02.840 --> 22:05.560
out of it.

22:05.560 --> 22:10.200
One of the good things about using matrix was that even the free tier attendees, the

22:10.200 --> 22:14.240
streaming tier attendees, could now actually interact by chat.

22:14.240 --> 22:19.120
So anybody with their own matrix ID could log on to any of our matrix rooms because they're

22:19.120 --> 22:23.280
all public, in the same way that all the FOSDEM rooms are public.

22:23.280 --> 22:28.880
Free attendees still got their own separated matrix ID, but that you only got logged on

22:28.880 --> 22:34.280
to the matrix ID if you actually popped up the side chat panel.

22:34.280 --> 22:39.280
You could also use your own separated matrix thing and use your own matrix ID as well if

22:39.280 --> 22:41.480
you wanted to.

22:41.480 --> 22:47.760
And it just depended how you wanted to interact with the conference.

22:47.760 --> 22:53.640
Cee Lunadi was the one who actually modified the BVB server to, instead of opening its

22:53.640 --> 22:59.520
own chat tab, we just stole the iframe concept it uses for the blackboard and we did a riot

22:59.520 --> 23:04.240
embedded which is done by some, the URL to the GitHub account is there.

23:04.240 --> 23:10.560
The integration, the riot embedded is not, it's not as good as running the electron type

23:10.560 --> 23:16.480
application, but trying to embed an electron application into a web form is just a nightmare

23:16.480 --> 23:17.880
and doesn't work.

23:17.880 --> 23:25.400
So it's a very cut down version, all it really does is text pictures and reactions.

23:25.400 --> 23:29.440
It doesn't do any of these sort of complicated threading or replies or anything, but that's

23:29.440 --> 23:32.840
pretty much good enough for conference attendees.

23:32.840 --> 23:37.280
But you can see the primrose path we're threading down because this is yet another integration

23:37.280 --> 23:45.520
into matrix, in BVB and matrix that is not done by either upstream.

23:45.520 --> 23:53.880
But it was really useful, so the streamers could see the chat, if it was greaked on their

23:53.880 --> 23:58.880
streaming screen, they could actually use a matrix client and still view the chat in

23:58.880 --> 24:04.040
real time without having to worry about video compression and reduction.

24:04.040 --> 24:10.120
And so we thought after we'd done this successfully for two years now, especially for one year

24:10.120 --> 24:14.440
with rocket chat, one year with matrix, it wouldn't be too difficult to move over to

24:14.440 --> 24:21.760
hybrid, which is probably really the point of this talk.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.040
We already had all the remote infrastructure.

24:24.040 --> 24:28.680
By the way, to run this style of remote infrastructure for a conference size of plumbers, so we're

24:28.680 --> 24:34.000
talking about 900 people and we assume that for the in-person one, we'd probably be about

24:34.000 --> 24:41.040
400 in-person, 500 online, it will cost you somewhere between $3,000 and $5,000 to actually

24:41.040 --> 24:42.040
set up and run.

24:42.040 --> 24:46.240
That's not cheap to do the hosting of all of this stuff, especially because we had to

24:46.240 --> 24:52.480
host at scale, we needed one BVB server per each track room, we had about six track rooms,

24:52.480 --> 24:59.840
we had a few spare servers left over for hack rooms and we had one for the hallway track.

24:59.840 --> 25:05.480
But the way we looked through this, we already had all of the AV necessary for actually just,

25:05.480 --> 25:10.240
this is the naive thought, which is where kernel developers go, we got AV in the room,

25:10.240 --> 25:14.640
it's got two cameras and it's got a load of microphones, the room is just another single

25:14.640 --> 25:21.240
person attending the BVB chat, it'll be easy to do it like that, the naive way of thinking.

25:21.240 --> 25:27.120
But it really, really is not that simple trying to get a hybrid conference running.

25:27.120 --> 25:33.880
The significant problem is that you have to integrate with in-room AV and in-room AV,

25:33.880 --> 25:39.480
well, okay, so at ULB, you control it, but we were doing it in hotels.

25:39.480 --> 25:43.760
ULBs have their own local AV teams, if you touch a piece of their equipment, they tend

25:43.760 --> 25:45.920
to go screaming to management.

25:45.920 --> 25:51.000
In order to get the integration done, you can't do it yourself as the conference organizers,

25:51.000 --> 25:57.640
the AV people, the audio people have to do it and it's surprising the number of audio

25:57.640 --> 26:02.520
people who sort of sit behind those switcher boards at the back of conferences who've never

26:02.520 --> 26:08.440
even seen a sort of online hybrid conference and have no idea how to set this up.

26:08.440 --> 26:13.000
So just plonking this sort of video display down in front of them and saying, hey, now

26:13.000 --> 26:18.520
you're in charge of audio and video and we just want the conference to work, it wasn't

26:18.520 --> 26:22.680
actually a winning strategy.

26:22.680 --> 26:27.880
So we discovered rapidly and unfortunately it was pretty much on the day of the conference

26:27.880 --> 26:32.840
that we had to train the AV people and have to use all of this stuff.

26:32.840 --> 26:39.160
And we were actually quite fortunate because we'd ordered the video-based AV, we actually

26:39.160 --> 26:41.360
had two sets of AV people.

26:41.360 --> 26:46.240
So the hotel usually supplies audio people to plug in your projectors and your microphones

26:46.240 --> 26:47.960
into the hotel's audio.

26:47.960 --> 26:52.840
And then we had a separate AV company whose job was to manage the cameras and sort of

26:52.840 --> 26:55.720
cut the whole thing together and do the live streaming.

26:55.720 --> 27:01.960
So we actually had two AV teams effectively and we were assuming that we could just co-opt

27:01.960 --> 27:06.560
the AV team who was doing the live streaming because live streaming, running live streaming

27:06.560 --> 27:10.200
is not much different than running an online conference, right?

27:10.200 --> 27:12.200
Wrong.

27:12.200 --> 27:18.080
So we held meetings beforehand with them and we talked to them about it.

27:18.080 --> 27:22.400
We couldn't hold meetings with the hotel audio guys but we assumed it would just be a plug

27:22.400 --> 27:25.160
for them, which it wasn't.

27:25.160 --> 27:31.320
And nobody really anticipated the issues that we actually had.

27:31.320 --> 27:37.040
The AV setup of remote attendees is not obvious to somebody who's used to dealing with throwing

27:37.040 --> 27:42.560
microphones around a room because there is one extra wire that's coming off the internet

27:42.560 --> 27:45.720
over which a lot of attendee voices can come.

27:45.720 --> 27:51.160
And the first time they set up their AV patch panels, this wire just wasn't plugged in.

27:51.160 --> 27:57.280
The second time it was bypassing all of the audio routing which meant that the sound quality

27:57.280 --> 28:01.560
and the volume was chopping at high strength because it wasn't being attenuated through

28:01.560 --> 28:02.560
the usual filters.

28:02.560 --> 28:07.920
I mean, this is the 101, you know, how many screw-ups can you have?

28:07.920 --> 28:12.200
We basically did them all on the first day.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.720
So let's go through a list of the problems.

28:14.720 --> 28:22.560
Oh, I even forgot to mention that between 2001 and 2002, we decided to upgrade the whole

28:22.560 --> 28:23.600
of the infrastructure.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.920
We had specific things in BBB we wanted.

28:26.920 --> 28:31.360
After I told you we have two cameras, we have one at the back facing the speaker, one at

28:31.360 --> 28:36.560
the front facing the audience, the new version of BBB could actually handle multiple cameras

28:36.560 --> 28:38.000
with different views.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.680
So we figured that wouldn't it be really great if, you know, you want to see the audience

28:42.680 --> 28:46.600
so you just select the audience camera as a remote participant because you want to talk

28:46.600 --> 28:50.600
to them, or let's say you're a remote speaker, you want to see the audience, but the rest

28:50.600 --> 28:54.040
of the people just want to see you, we'll do this multiple camera selection.

28:54.040 --> 28:58.400
It was going to be the cornerstone of our implementation of this.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.120
Problem was, nobody told the AV guys.

29:01.120 --> 29:06.000
So the AV guys had come set up with a switcher for the two cameras, which is how they ran

29:06.000 --> 29:10.640
the streaming because obviously you can select one camera view or the other because the live

29:10.640 --> 29:14.520
streaming pretty much has one camera view out on it.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.640
And by the time we all sat together in the room, there was no way of unplugging this

29:18.640 --> 29:23.440
setup and we doing it such that we could plug in two video cameras because it all has to

29:23.440 --> 29:27.560
be done from the AV control deck and they physically didn't have another input because

29:27.560 --> 29:29.920
they were expecting to use a camera switch.

29:29.920 --> 29:33.000
So this is yet another screw up in planning.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.520
Third screw up was because we'd upgraded the new BBB, they'd redone the, and this user's

29:39.520 --> 29:44.480
node react as the frame backbone, they'd redone the way it was working.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.360
Riot embedded no longer worked as a pop out panel.

29:47.360 --> 29:50.900
We discovered this fortunately four days before the conference.

29:50.900 --> 29:55.280
So this was Guilinardi doing a very quick back end retrofit, trying to get the matrix

29:55.280 --> 29:58.880
chat that everybody was expecting to work to work.

29:58.880 --> 30:02.960
And fortunately by the time we did the conference, it was actually working, but this was yet

30:02.960 --> 30:10.360
another squeaky bum issue where we tried to do everything at the last minute.

30:10.360 --> 30:15.000
The first day we had a lot of rooms where the room couldn't hear the remote attendees.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.800
This is the wire problem from the remote or the remote attendees couldn't hear the room

30:20.800 --> 30:22.680
because it's a two wire problem.

30:22.680 --> 30:27.040
It's not just sound from the remote coming into the room, it's sound from the room going

30:27.040 --> 30:28.840
out to the remotes as well.

30:28.840 --> 30:32.360
So we had to have the sound correctly plugged into BBB.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.320
The streaming guys thought they were just plugging the sound into the streaming.

30:35.320 --> 30:39.720
So if you watch the live stream, it had the correct sound, but if you were on the BBB

30:39.720 --> 30:43.480
thing, it was completely silent because they hadn't plugged the sound in.

30:43.480 --> 30:48.240
It's just yet another screw up that we didn't actually think to test out.

30:48.240 --> 30:54.080
So this is how it looks in the sort of conference hall as we were going around it.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.160
So this is the panel you can see.

30:56.160 --> 31:00.600
This is what BBB looks like pretty much in a classroom situation.

31:00.600 --> 31:06.580
This is the presentation, which you can actually minimize if you click this button, but obviously

31:06.580 --> 31:10.800
we thought that the AV people might be able to click the minimize button when the conversation

31:10.800 --> 31:12.760
is going on and then click it back again.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.360
No, it didn't really work.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.960
They didn't really want to do this.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.040
So we just kept everything up.

31:18.040 --> 31:22.360
This is the attendees panel, which is all scrolling, which is nice, but if you think

31:22.360 --> 31:25.720
about it, that's not really what you want to see in the conference.

31:25.720 --> 31:30.960
The chat panel, if you click this, will pop out and come here, and the rest of this will

31:30.960 --> 31:34.380
really shrink, which is also not really what the attendees did.

31:34.380 --> 31:38.120
So what we should have done is have the chat panel down here and get rid of the attendee

31:38.120 --> 31:41.120
list or make it pop out only.

31:41.120 --> 31:44.920
So we put this on our to-do list for next time because it's sort of a nice to have,

31:44.920 --> 31:48.640
and it wasn't essential to getting the conference working.

31:48.640 --> 31:52.200
This is actually an excerpt from the RISC-5 microconference.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.600
So Atish Patra is actually asking a remote question.

31:55.600 --> 31:59.520
You can see that he's asking it of a member of the audience, so we've switched to the

31:59.520 --> 32:03.320
audience camera view, because ideally there would have been two cameras here, one of the

32:03.320 --> 32:06.560
audience, one of the speaker, and he could have switched between them, but we screwed

32:06.560 --> 32:11.160
up and didn't get that working in time.

32:11.160 --> 32:18.840
The tab also includes shared notes, which goes to a back end on ether pads, so the remote

32:18.840 --> 32:24.480
audience can also see the shared notes, and they can also click on the pop-up, and these

32:24.480 --> 32:30.120
buttons here actually allow you to mute people who are not supposed to be speaking when they

32:30.120 --> 32:34.360
are, because in a remote conference you get lots of people who forget to mute their microphone

32:34.360 --> 32:39.560
and then have a conversation with their wife or their significant other.

32:39.560 --> 32:41.560
This happens quite often.

32:41.560 --> 32:46.120
The way BBB is set up is that anybody can mute anybody, but we thought that might be

32:46.120 --> 32:50.040
a bad idea, because it's cantankerous kernel developers.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.080
You never quite know who they'll mute.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.840
Once you've muted somebody, you can't unmute them.

32:54.840 --> 32:59.360
They can only unmute themselves, because this is a sort of, you can't be unmuting people

32:59.360 --> 33:00.960
while they're going to the bathroom or something.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.560
It wouldn't be good on the conference.

33:04.560 --> 33:10.000
We figured this might be a problem, so we restricted this functionality to administrators

33:10.000 --> 33:14.640
only, and then nobody could figure out who the administrators were, so it became a bit

33:14.640 --> 33:17.160
of a problem.

33:17.160 --> 33:20.280
The video overlays work quite well.

33:20.280 --> 33:26.600
This is pretty much a blow-up of a 1080p thing, and you can see the greaking happening in

33:26.600 --> 33:27.600
the room.

33:27.600 --> 33:32.080
It's very difficult to make out individual attendees, but the sort of remote participants

33:32.080 --> 33:34.760
were reasonably visible to most people.

33:34.760 --> 33:41.160
BBB, and especially, you can actually see the way it works with the video-muting idea.

33:41.160 --> 33:44.960
It's really all you see are the people participating.

33:44.960 --> 33:52.560
One of the other things that we'd actually tried to do in the room is the camera at the

33:52.560 --> 33:59.040
front facing the back actually had a pan and zoom facility, which the AV operators assured

33:59.040 --> 34:04.440
us would allow them to zoom in on whoever was speaking, but in the event, what we discovered

34:04.440 --> 34:10.040
is that only two of the AV operators out of our six rooms knew how to use this.

34:10.040 --> 34:13.360
We did get panning and zooming in some of the rooms, but not in all of them.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.720
Again, this goes back to preparation and training.

34:15.720 --> 34:24.240
We will do better next time.

34:24.240 --> 34:27.160
It actually took us quite a while to get the audio routing right.

34:27.160 --> 34:32.240
We think that plugging two wires into an AV system wouldn't be that difficult, but in

34:32.240 --> 34:35.720
fact, it really was.

34:35.720 --> 34:41.800
We finally figured out that what you had to say to the audio guy is, here's a wire from

34:41.800 --> 34:44.200
what's effectively a microphone on the computer.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.120
The video guy will give it to you.

34:46.120 --> 34:49.560
You just plug it into your fader panel and remember you have it.

34:49.560 --> 34:56.840
You give him a wire for the AV stream that also has to go into the BBB thing.

34:56.840 --> 35:02.440
Obviously we got that to work, but obviously we had other problems.

35:02.440 --> 35:06.640
One of the other things that we'd really thought about was, when we get into the room, we'd

35:06.640 --> 35:11.160
actually like to have the chat and all the remote attendees on one monitor, and then

35:11.160 --> 35:13.600
we'd like to have the presentations on another.

35:13.600 --> 35:18.800
We thought we'll have a two projector setup, which sounds fine until you realize that we

35:18.800 --> 35:25.200
have rooms about as big as this, and the two projectors were right over there and right

35:25.200 --> 35:26.800
over there.

35:26.800 --> 35:30.480
Somebody sitting over there can't see what's on that projector.

35:30.480 --> 35:34.320
Somebody sitting over there can't see what's on that projector.

35:34.320 --> 35:38.040
The only way we could make it work was to display the same image on both projectors,

35:38.040 --> 35:41.800
which meant that two projectors was a complete waste of money, and we should have gone for

35:41.800 --> 35:44.400
a single central one as well.

35:44.400 --> 35:53.680
Next year we will either try with one or three, just to see if we can actually get this right.

35:53.680 --> 35:57.240
Obviously as I said, the two-camera handling, we thought would be the centerpiece of the

35:57.240 --> 35:58.240
technology.

35:58.240 --> 36:03.560
The reason why we'd upgraded BBB and caused all of the React JScript failures on the Matrix

36:03.560 --> 36:07.280
back end was to get this facility that we couldn't actually use.

36:07.280 --> 36:11.680
That was not only sleepless nights for one person for a week to try and get it all to

36:11.680 --> 36:16.040
work, but complete screw-up on the day when everything we thought we'd bought with that

36:16.040 --> 36:21.800
upgrade didn't function.

36:21.800 --> 36:28.720
The other problem we had was, because the AV people are actually doing the live streaming

36:28.720 --> 36:34.400
and because of the way BBB works, there is no choice other than to actually run the Master

36:34.400 --> 36:42.320
BB session that is showing up on both projectors on their AVMux console.

36:42.320 --> 36:51.720
I had thought this might be a problem as well, so BBB is very heavily React JavaScript

36:51.720 --> 36:57.520
based and certain browsers handle it better than other browsers.

36:57.520 --> 37:01.880
It works with Firefox quite well now, but it is mostly optimized for Chromium.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.480
So I had actually already asked them, God, if we have to do this, what is the built-in

37:05.480 --> 37:07.440
browser of this Tmux thing?

37:07.440 --> 37:12.360
They said, oh, it's Chrome, and I thought, oh, God, it's going to work.

37:12.360 --> 37:20.960
But the problem was that the Mux platform might have used Chromium as an internal thing,

37:20.960 --> 37:22.720
but Chromium is open source.

37:22.720 --> 37:27.240
So the guys who built the Mux platform had just basically taken WebKit, gutted some

37:27.240 --> 37:30.120
of the JavaScripts and hoped that that would be OK.

37:30.120 --> 37:34.920
What it really meant was the threading functions of JavaScript didn't work very well.

37:34.920 --> 37:39.880
The result was that it kept dropping out of the conference, and obviously, since this

37:39.880 --> 37:46.400
is running the AV conference, when it drops out, the in-room chat and the remote participants

37:46.400 --> 37:48.080
fully separate.

37:48.080 --> 37:52.160
The problem is there's no indication that this has happened from the console unless you

37:52.160 --> 37:56.880
happen to be watching very carefully, because all you see is that a microphone disappears

37:56.880 --> 38:01.280
from that little icon in the top left that says, hey, you're the room, and suddenly your

38:01.280 --> 38:02.680
microphone's gone.

38:02.680 --> 38:06.120
That's the only indication the AV people had they dropped out.

38:06.120 --> 38:10.320
Trying to train them to notice this and reconnect was a bit of a problem.

38:10.320 --> 38:15.960
So we do have automated reconnections on the back end, but we will try and integrate into

38:15.960 --> 38:20.240
BVV, but when we raised it on the list, they looked at us and said, well, how come you

38:20.240 --> 38:23.000
have this problem because nobody else has this problem?

38:23.000 --> 38:27.920
If BVV kept on dropping people out of the conversation as a matter of course, people

38:27.920 --> 38:29.420
would have complained.

38:29.420 --> 38:34.320
This was a specific interaction due to the cut-down browser in the T-Mux interface that

38:34.320 --> 38:35.920
nobody had anticipated.

38:35.920 --> 38:41.600
Again, another screw up from not actually trying it beforehand.

38:41.600 --> 38:45.480
So as I said, rejoin was manual, assuming the AV guy noticed.

38:45.480 --> 38:49.440
One of the good things we did have was interim shepherds who were committee members.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.960
So they could actually watch the on-screen panel.

38:52.960 --> 38:57.560
Every time the icon disappeared, I or one of the other shepherds could run to the back

38:57.560 --> 39:02.240
of the room and pat the AV guy on the shoulder and say, you need to rejoin, please do this.

39:02.240 --> 39:10.000
So we could make it work with a lot of manual fussing behind the scenes, but it wasn't easy.

39:10.000 --> 39:16.760
So one of the other things that we realized is that the hindsight is 20-20.

39:16.760 --> 39:21.000
They might want to run it from the AV console, but they don't have to run the whole thing.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.040
What we could have done is have a separate laptop that actually ran all of the AV connections

39:26.040 --> 39:29.520
under the charge of, I won't say somebody competent because it would have been one of

39:29.520 --> 39:33.800
me, the kernel developers or somebody, but somebody who would pay more attention.

39:33.800 --> 39:37.800
And then what we could have done for the V-Mux guys was to actually give them a VNC session

39:37.800 --> 39:43.960
or something like that into the panels that they were projecting over the streaming and

39:43.960 --> 39:45.200
everything else.

39:45.200 --> 39:49.080
And that way we would have had much more control in the room and we'd have been running a

39:49.080 --> 39:53.320
full-fledged browser that wouldn't have had most of the connection problems that we had.

39:53.320 --> 39:58.360
But obviously trying to sort that out on the day was pretty much impossible.

39:58.360 --> 40:03.600
Particularly unfortunate is this AV-Mux platform is sort of Windows-based and Windows does

40:03.600 --> 40:08.840
not do VNC very well and trying to get it to work with RDSP, which is the Windows native

40:08.840 --> 40:11.000
thing, didn't work very well.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.440
And we just, it was, we were in Dublin, we didn't have any equipment, we had to organize

40:15.440 --> 40:19.720
the parties and deal with online conferences, we just couldn't get it to work.

40:19.720 --> 40:26.160
So we do know that for the future we are going to try and do a shareable console.

40:26.160 --> 40:29.240
And I need to leave time for questions.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.280
I have 10 minutes left.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.120
We had a load of other problems as well.

40:34.120 --> 40:41.360
As you can see, this, so I'm, in order to try and tell you all the difficulty about

40:41.360 --> 40:44.560
doing this, I'm talking up the problems.

40:44.560 --> 40:48.980
From the audience's point of view, this conference was actually very successful.

40:48.980 --> 40:54.080
We got plaudits from most of the attendees that the interaction worked as they expected.

40:54.080 --> 40:58.800
They could have their one-on-one conversations, including between remote and local people,

40:58.800 --> 41:00.160
remote and remote people.

41:00.160 --> 41:04.840
So everything appeared to just work for them, modulo, you know, the problems of not being

41:04.840 --> 41:09.000
able to hear the room and having to rejoin and having to tell people they lost AV and

41:09.000 --> 41:10.280
they needed to rejoin.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.800
They forgave us for all of that.

41:11.800 --> 41:16.520
So it was actually highly rated as an incredibly successful conference, but it was a bit like

41:16.520 --> 41:21.240
a swan with that, you know, serene sort of thing swimming over the surface and a load

41:21.240 --> 41:25.080
of committee members frantically paddling underneath to try and get all of this to stay

41:25.080 --> 41:28.880
up and running.

41:28.880 --> 41:34.480
Our other big screw up was that we had a committee of 10 people, but because this was pandemic,

41:34.480 --> 41:38.960
not all of the committee could turn up in Dublin, and by the time we got to Dublin,

41:38.960 --> 41:43.680
we only had two local people who actually understood the system and could deal with

41:43.680 --> 41:44.680
it.

41:44.680 --> 41:48.320
Surprisingly enough, the two people who are actually standing up on the platform now taking

41:48.320 --> 41:50.280
the blame for all of this.

41:50.280 --> 41:57.480
But believe me, in a conference with six tracks and AV guys who don't know what they're doing,

41:57.480 --> 42:01.000
if you want a lot of exercise, please do it with two people.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.760
But if you want to actually make it work seamlessly and vaguely competently, you need one person

42:06.760 --> 42:09.160
who understands the setup in each room.

42:09.160 --> 42:13.840
So next time we will try and do it with a minimum number of people as we have same number

42:13.840 --> 42:14.840
of track rooms.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.480
Again, it's not rocket science.

42:16.480 --> 42:19.760
It's perhaps something we should have seen ahead of time, but we thought it would be

42:19.760 --> 42:23.760
easy and it wasn't.

42:23.760 --> 42:29.360
So to leave a bit of time for questions, if you have them, running conferences is actually

42:29.360 --> 42:30.360
hard.

42:30.360 --> 42:33.240
So just remember that when you go home from here.

42:33.240 --> 42:38.360
And volunteering for a conference is actually an act of public self-sacrifice that more

42:38.360 --> 42:44.640
of you should consider, because honestly, you will find out that it is really hard.

42:44.640 --> 42:49.480
Running online conferences is harder, especially if you try and do it yourselves, because there

42:49.480 --> 42:51.400
is actually a lot more to do.

42:51.400 --> 42:55.440
It is actually more difficult to run an online conference than it is to run an in-person

42:55.440 --> 42:59.760
conference paradoxically.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.400
And this is mainly to do with the integration issues.

43:02.400 --> 43:05.720
Everything that doesn't integrate well is either your fault or you're responsible for

43:05.720 --> 43:07.080
integrating it.

43:07.080 --> 43:11.600
And integrating web stuff, even in this magic day and age of sort of, you know, web scripting

43:11.600 --> 43:16.360
and operators and everything else, really doesn't work that well.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.880
And hybrid is really only for masochists.

43:19.880 --> 43:24.360
Only do a hybrid conference if you want to give yourself an untold amount of pain that

43:24.360 --> 43:29.640
you can then come and complain to an audience like you about later.

43:29.640 --> 43:34.120
But if you really want to get it right, the key is training your AV people.

43:34.120 --> 43:38.600
Do not wait like we did to turn up on the day and say it will be easy.

43:38.600 --> 43:42.800
You need a couple of training sessions a few months beforehand to try and get all of the

43:42.800 --> 43:45.120
kinks sorted out.

43:45.120 --> 43:48.600
And having meetings and discussing it doesn't cut it.

43:48.600 --> 43:54.320
You need the AV people to set it all up and preferably have a few people fly out to see

43:54.320 --> 44:01.880
the setup, work with a few remote people so you actually check it out in all of its situations.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.280
And obviously, you need to do this in advance.

44:04.280 --> 44:07.360
You don't do it on the day of the conference, which is what we tried to do.

44:07.360 --> 44:09.440
Oh, well, lesson learned.

44:09.440 --> 44:15.360
So with that, I think I have about five minutes for questions.

44:15.360 --> 44:18.880
This was actually all done in open source using HTML and CSS.

44:18.880 --> 44:23.440
That does make me a web developer, proud of it now, finally.

44:23.440 --> 44:28.400
Obviously you can see that current developers don't quite do web as well as web developers.

44:28.400 --> 44:32.640
So if any web developers would like to join our program committee and become jointly responsible

44:32.640 --> 44:35.920
for next year's disaster, please come forward.

44:35.920 --> 44:40.640
The presentation is all online, and I've also put it up on a link in PentaBath.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.680
So you should just be able to click on it.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.760
All of the links in the presentation that are highlighted are clickable if you want to

44:45.760 --> 44:47.440
see the URLs.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.200
And with that, I'll just say thank you.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.120
And Mike and I can now answer questions.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.120
Oops.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.120
You have Mike.

44:53.120 --> 45:01.120
Okay, we'll share this, Mike.

45:01.120 --> 45:06.080
Any questions?

45:06.080 --> 45:14.080
Please speak loudly into the microphone.

45:14.080 --> 45:20.240
Yes, thank you.

45:20.240 --> 45:25.720
From what you said about the AV setups in the hotels, were there any discussion to just

45:25.720 --> 45:29.880
ask the hotels to, you know, move their stuff and have your own stuff brought in?

45:29.880 --> 45:35.440
Because to me, that seems after your talk to have been an easier solution to just say,

45:35.440 --> 45:39.760
you know, your AV guys and your AV is probably good, but we have really specialized needs.

45:39.760 --> 45:41.680
Could we just bring our own equipment in?

45:41.680 --> 45:42.680
Okay.

45:42.680 --> 45:45.840
So the question is, could we bring our own equipment in?

45:45.840 --> 45:50.440
And the answer is pretty much every hotel, no.

45:50.440 --> 45:55.200
Because remember they do the AV routing as a very specialized sort of adaption for the

45:55.200 --> 45:56.400
conference rooms.

45:56.400 --> 46:00.360
They have a lot of really expensive speakers, sometimes in the ceilings, sometimes in the

46:00.360 --> 46:04.820
back of the room, and they don't want any non-experts touching it.

46:04.820 --> 46:09.840
So what hotels usually have as a clause in their contract is a requirement that you use

46:09.840 --> 46:11.440
their own sound guys.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.560
And this clause is non-negotiable.

46:13.560 --> 46:18.080
We did try to negotiate with a couple of hotels where we said, because we had a few screw-ups

46:18.080 --> 46:21.800
even in the live streaming days where the hotel didn't do very well and we thought we

46:21.800 --> 46:23.160
could do better.

46:23.160 --> 46:26.200
But it's always come back to us as an absolute no.

46:26.200 --> 46:31.400
It's actually very lucky for the ULB guys are used to having students handle their equipment

46:31.400 --> 46:34.960
and don't seem to have as many hang-ups about it as hotels.

46:34.960 --> 46:39.720
So there are people here who can be trained on this equipment who can use it.

46:39.720 --> 46:44.360
But pretty much when you're running a conference in a hotel or in a professional conference

46:44.360 --> 46:48.720
hall that we've also been to, so a community convention center or something, you actually

46:48.720 --> 46:50.480
have to use their AV staff.

46:50.480 --> 46:51.800
You don't get a choice.

46:51.800 --> 46:56.040
And that means that you always have this extra component of people that you have to deal

46:56.040 --> 46:57.040
with.

46:57.040 --> 47:00.680
And they're usually people who don't really understand fully what your requirements are

47:00.680 --> 47:03.920
because it's very difficult to communicate to the head of time.

47:03.920 --> 47:07.520
And these people are usually the people that you don't get to talk to until you turn up

47:07.520 --> 47:08.920
at the conference.

47:08.920 --> 47:13.120
So when you have your intermediate AV guys like we had and you have your meeting with

47:13.120 --> 47:17.600
them, you always have to make sure that they have enough knowledge and insight that they

47:17.600 --> 47:22.040
can do the knowledge transfer to the sound guys who are going to be coming in on the

47:22.040 --> 47:24.000
day from the hotel.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.160
So yeah, it's a huge problem and there's almost nothing you can do to get out of it

47:28.160 --> 47:33.160
besides sort of having a very friendly university who will let you play with their equipment

47:33.160 --> 47:39.320
because pretty much nobody in the professional circuit will let you play with their equipment.

47:39.320 --> 47:42.440
I have one question from the chat.

47:42.440 --> 47:46.160
Was it worth it to record the audience?

47:46.160 --> 47:50.080
So the question was, was it worth it to record the audience?

47:50.080 --> 47:55.280
And the answer to that is actually very much yes, because remember in a micro conference

47:55.280 --> 47:59.160
we're stimulating discussions between arbitrary groups of people.

47:59.160 --> 48:03.040
So these would be people who are sitting in the audience physically versus people who

48:03.040 --> 48:05.080
are sort of remote.

48:05.080 --> 48:10.160
And in order to have a correct two-way conversation, you actually have to be able to see the person

48:10.160 --> 48:11.440
on the other end.

48:11.440 --> 48:15.640
And so the whole point of the audience camera, at least when it worked with the panning and

48:15.640 --> 48:21.120
zooming, was that if you were having a remote to local conversation with the audience, the

48:21.120 --> 48:24.600
remote people could actually see the local participant.

48:24.600 --> 48:29.760
And if we only had a camera facing the speaker, we'd either have to call every participant

48:29.760 --> 48:35.880
up to stand on the stage, which wastes time, or we'd just have to not have them be able

48:35.880 --> 48:38.120
to see the person they're talking to.

48:38.120 --> 48:42.320
And being able to see the person you're talking to is very important for interactions.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.880
There are lots of visual cues that people get wrong.

48:44.880 --> 48:52.200
So I think having an audience camera is actually one of the good benefits of, or at least one

48:52.200 --> 48:56.160
of the benefits the plumbers did and one of the good insights we had to try and get an

48:56.160 --> 48:58.000
interactive conference running.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.640
So I wouldn't go back and do no audience camera, no.

49:02.640 --> 49:10.360
Just wanted to get back to what you said about the ULB being willing to allow us to use their

49:10.360 --> 49:11.360
audio equipment.

49:11.360 --> 49:14.480
I just want to point out that this has a lot to do with the fact that we've been doing

49:14.480 --> 49:17.160
this for 20 years and they know us.

49:17.160 --> 49:23.080
It wasn't always the case, and if you're not supposed to, or you're not working with

49:23.080 --> 49:26.080
the ULB, this probably isn't the case.

49:26.080 --> 49:29.600
So could you repeat the, I got half the question, no.

49:29.600 --> 49:35.440
Yeah, it wasn't the question really so much as to point out that us being allowed to touch

49:35.440 --> 49:39.680
the audio equipment here, by the ULB has a lot to do with the fact that we've been doing

49:39.680 --> 49:41.280
this for 20 years and they know us.

49:41.280 --> 49:45.840
Okay, so the point being made is that ULB only allows the staff here to touch the equipment

49:45.840 --> 49:48.920
because they've been doing it a long time and they've built up trust.

49:48.920 --> 49:53.840
The way we work, we tend to go to a different hotel every time we hold plumbers in a different

49:53.840 --> 49:55.000
location.

49:55.000 --> 50:01.760
So pretty much even if we could get a trust to build up with a hotel chain, we wouldn't

50:01.760 --> 50:04.240
be in the hotel often enough to do it.

50:04.240 --> 50:10.920
But the important point to emphasize is that pretty much 95% of the time you will be forced

50:10.920 --> 50:15.720
to work with AV people who are supplied to you by whoever owns the equipment.

50:15.720 --> 50:20.720
You won't get a choice of who does it.

50:20.720 --> 50:21.720
Okay.

50:21.720 --> 50:22.720
Is that it?

50:22.720 --> 50:23.720
Okay.

50:23.720 --> 50:48.280
Well, thank you very much indeed.
