WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Okay, all right, is the mic working?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Yeah.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Yeah.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
All right.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Great.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Okay.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
All right.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Welcome, everyone.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.800
I'm going to talk about a program that I've started at Red Hat called Kernel Development

00:22.800 --> 00:29.360
Learning Pipeline that I run with a small group of engineers kind of as a side project.

00:29.360 --> 00:35.280
So first, I'll talk about what it is, first of all, why it's a good idea, why we think

00:35.280 --> 00:40.000
it's a good idea and we're doing it, a little bit about the program and some of the growth

00:40.000 --> 00:46.760
that we've had in the program over the past year, two years approximately, and then conclude

00:46.760 --> 00:50.960
with some resources about the program.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.240
So first of all, what is KDLP?

00:53.240 --> 00:57.760
So that stands for Kernel Development Learning Pipeline, credit for that acronym to Julia

00:57.760 --> 01:05.280
Denham, actually, and we are building a comprehensive pipeline for Linux kernel talent and low-level

01:05.280 --> 01:11.200
talent more generally, because as it turns out, there's not a lot of younger people getting

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
into the kernel.

01:12.200 --> 01:18.520
It's not an extremely popular area of study, it's barely really taught in school.

01:18.520 --> 01:24.920
So right now, the main component is we have a course that we're teaching at UMass Lowell

01:24.920 --> 01:28.440
and also on the Linux Foundation's platform.

01:28.440 --> 01:33.720
We are trying to recruit interns from this course and from this program and through kind

01:33.720 --> 01:35.360
of our network.

01:35.360 --> 01:39.040
We bring people in and then they serve as TAs and help develop the course and improve

01:39.040 --> 01:40.880
the content.

01:40.880 --> 01:46.240
And then ideally, we bring them in and recruit them full-time, that's the goal.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.640
So yeah, why is this a good idea?

01:48.640 --> 01:54.600
So like I was saying, a lot of senior Linux kernel engineers are getting somewhat close

01:54.600 --> 01:55.600
to retirement.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.800
That's kind of, definitely a much higher, I think, average age in kernel and in like

01:59.800 --> 02:05.280
low-level engineering, at least in the US that I've noticed, than in other areas of

02:05.280 --> 02:06.280
software engineering.

02:06.280 --> 02:11.480
And it takes a very long time for people to learn the Linux kernel, especially today,

02:11.480 --> 02:16.640
because a lot of people don't even learn C in school and they're generally separated

02:16.640 --> 02:20.280
from a lot of the low-level computer science concepts.

02:20.280 --> 02:25.040
Things that people 20, 30, 40 years ago, so I'm told, were learned kind of as a standard

02:25.040 --> 02:26.040
thing.

02:26.040 --> 02:30.240
Today, it's sort of a niche topic.

02:30.240 --> 02:35.560
There are people getting into it, but only kind of in-ditch communities at certain schools

02:35.560 --> 02:40.800
if you're exposed to certain people or certain online communities.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.560
So the kernel itself is barely taught.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.680
People take maybe one class in opening systems and a lot of the tools, like some of the more

02:46.680 --> 02:50.000
advanced get usage, for example.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.360
It's difficult to learn that kind of stuff.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.760
How do people learn how to do email patches without trying and failing and just getting

02:54.760 --> 02:55.760
roasted online?

02:55.760 --> 02:58.160
It's kind of difficult.

02:58.160 --> 03:02.080
So for a lot of companies, it's difficult to find talent.

03:02.080 --> 03:07.160
I mean, I know at Red Hat, it can be somewhat difficult to find people who have some Linux

03:07.160 --> 03:11.000
kernel knowledge and are actually interested in doing it.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.240
There's lots of people who are capable of doing it and just maybe don't like it that

03:14.240 --> 03:15.240
much.

03:15.240 --> 03:20.320
So, of course, the way that we're pitching this to Red Hat and the way that it's a good

03:20.320 --> 03:24.240
idea for any company is that we think we can bring more value to the company for a lower

03:24.240 --> 03:25.240
cost.

03:25.240 --> 03:29.680
But for the community, what we are trying to bring is to train the next generation of

03:29.680 --> 03:34.840
developers from all sorts of different backgrounds, as opposed to just people who happen to bump

03:34.840 --> 03:38.320
into somebody at a recruiting event, which is how I got into the kernel.

03:38.320 --> 03:42.480
I just happened to run into somebody at an event that he wasn't even supposed to be

03:42.480 --> 03:45.600
at, in fact.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.080
So a little overview.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.480
So there's kind of three main sections of the program.

03:51.480 --> 03:57.920
So the first is this kernel development course that we've developed that is taught at UMass

03:57.920 --> 03:58.920
Lool.

03:58.920 --> 04:02.840
So we've created this from scratch using, originally based on the Linux device drivers

04:02.840 --> 04:05.600
third edition book, but we've kind of gone further from that.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.760
That's actually one of the latest books on Linux kernel engineering and it's published

04:09.760 --> 04:12.920
in 2005.

04:12.920 --> 04:18.040
But yeah, so we've been working on developing our own curriculum with a number of different

04:18.040 --> 04:26.440
labs and some slide decks and kind of a whole, you know, a set of things that people could

04:26.440 --> 04:28.600
do to learn the kernel.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.560
And then from there, we tried to bring people into internships as we're able to do that

04:32.560 --> 04:38.120
or other kind of more second level or hands on experiences where they can further develop

04:38.120 --> 04:42.920
those skills and then ideally bring them in as full time engineers at Red Hat or I mean

04:42.920 --> 04:46.000
the beauty of open source is if they get recruited somewhere else or if they go work

04:46.000 --> 04:49.280
somewhere else in the open source community, that's still, that's a win for everyone in

04:49.280 --> 04:50.280
the community.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.960
It's a win for all the companies working with the community because everyone working on

04:52.960 --> 04:57.160
the kernel is working on the kernel.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.200
So a little more about the course.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.520
The goal is to introduce students to Linux kernel development.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.280
You know, obviously we can't teach them the entire kernel.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.520
We can barely even introduce them to one subsystem, but the goal is to teach them kind of what

05:09.520 --> 05:14.080
they need to learn to teach themselves and to teach them what they need to know to work

05:14.080 --> 05:19.080
in one of these open source communities, specifically the Linux kernel community, but those skills

05:19.080 --> 05:24.840
I think are pretty applicable to other kind of more niche open source areas that can be

05:24.840 --> 05:28.400
somewhat intimidating for a lot of people to get into.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.160
We mostly just require C language skills.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.480
I mean that's obviously the most important thing when you're working in the kernel.

05:34.480 --> 05:41.120
That's a basic Linux experience, some programming experience in general, but not need a ton

05:41.120 --> 05:46.680
of Linux kernel experience to get started, but really the most critical thing to see.

05:46.680 --> 05:54.480
So we teach kind of an overview of just various kernel features and subsystems, kind of describe

05:54.480 --> 06:02.280
like a map of the kernel, what there is, what, you know, how the different pieces connect

06:02.280 --> 06:05.280
together, how you can interact with it.

06:05.280 --> 06:10.360
We approach through device driver development, that's a good way to get people into, you

06:10.360 --> 06:14.040
know, to work with a lot of the different APIs, because to write a device driver you

06:14.040 --> 06:18.520
need to interact with a lot of different areas and you end up building something that's somewhat

06:18.520 --> 06:24.480
kind of complete piece that works on its own, and then we introduce people to more advanced

06:24.480 --> 06:25.480
usage of Git.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.800
I mean people may be familiar with GitHub, but you know, believe it or not, a lot of

06:27.800 --> 06:31.000
people don't know the difference between Git and GitHub.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.140
So we help out with that and get them started with email patches and rebases and things

06:36.140 --> 06:37.640
like that.

06:37.640 --> 06:42.000
We also talk about BPF Trace and other tracing, which are things that they, I don't think

06:42.000 --> 06:46.760
BPF Trace or BPF in general is taught in any school that I know of, at least not in undergrad

06:46.760 --> 06:52.400
courses, you know, NCSCope and other ways to explore large projects and repositories,

06:52.400 --> 06:57.600
because you know, in a computer science program people generally don't get exposed to working

06:57.600 --> 06:59.720
on like large ongoing projects.

06:59.720 --> 07:04.160
You know, you work on some, you know, one and done thing, and you know, then you send

07:04.160 --> 07:06.880
it in and no one else looks at it and you get your grade and you move on, right?

07:06.880 --> 07:11.520
So we're introducing people to work on larger code bases, which is something that's somewhat

07:11.520 --> 07:13.560
unusual for a university course.

07:13.560 --> 07:17.960
So of course, all these course materials and the assignments completely open source.

07:17.960 --> 07:22.920
We've linked it, it's all on our website, and we're continuously improving it.

07:22.920 --> 07:27.360
You know, the source for the website is also on GitHub, you know, if anyone has any suggestions

07:27.360 --> 07:30.440
or changes, we're always open to them.

07:30.440 --> 07:34.240
So we have undergraduate and graduate level university courses that run at UMass Lowell

07:34.240 --> 07:36.960
that we've created over the past couple of years.

07:36.960 --> 07:41.320
It became kind of a full-fledged course in the fall semester of last year.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.000
So it's relatively new.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.560
And this semester we were also running it as a kind of dual program with the Linux Foundation's

07:47.560 --> 07:50.000
mentorship platform.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.960
So we have people applying on there to, I will also talk a little bit more about that

07:53.960 --> 07:54.960
later.

07:54.960 --> 08:01.560
We run through the course and kind of work with at the same schedule and at the same

08:01.560 --> 08:05.840
pace as the people at UMass Lowell, but they're from around the world and they don't need

08:05.840 --> 08:07.200
to be enrolled as students.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.040
They can come from anywhere, right?

08:09.040 --> 08:13.560
And kind of the bottom line is we try to reimagine how to teach this kind of material from first

08:13.560 --> 08:16.920
principles because it doesn't really make sense to teach it from a typical, like memorize

08:16.920 --> 08:20.560
this and do the exam kind of perspective, right?

08:20.560 --> 08:25.820
The goal is to get people to be able to explain things in their own words and to work on open

08:25.820 --> 08:29.320
source projects and work in open source communities.

08:29.320 --> 08:33.760
So we've replaced exams with presentations where they actually explain the work that

08:33.760 --> 08:38.480
they've done in their own words to their peers.

08:38.480 --> 08:43.480
So from there we recruit people as interns and try to bring them in.

08:43.480 --> 08:50.440
So we find people in the course who are enthusiastic and capable about so by the time we bring

08:50.440 --> 08:53.560
them in to the internship, they also have a lot of prerequisite knowledge that they

08:53.560 --> 08:55.320
would need.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.400
And so they're able to hit the ground running and do a lot more in their three to six month

08:59.400 --> 09:05.160
period or longer than they otherwise would have because actually, so I had a, the manager

09:05.160 --> 09:09.440
who hired me at Red Hat originally as a co-op, he said he didn't like to do summer internships

09:09.440 --> 09:13.480
in the kernel because by the time three months are over, they've just gotten on boarded.

09:13.480 --> 09:18.000
They've just started to understand how to work with a Linux kernel and then it's over

09:18.000 --> 09:19.600
and then they got to go.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.000
So he only really did co-ops.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.360
But the goal with this is if we kind of vet people ahead of time and we give them the

09:24.360 --> 09:27.360
skills that they need and give them kind of, you know, the get skills and the, you know,

09:27.360 --> 09:30.800
they compile the kernel and they have the background, they actually can get some value

09:30.800 --> 09:36.000
from an internship and we're more likely to bring people into internships who actually

09:36.000 --> 09:39.080
want to work in the kernel and then they're more likely to go off and, you know, and work

09:39.080 --> 09:43.380
in the kernel in general or work in open source communities.

09:43.380 --> 09:47.560
So we pair them up with rail engineers and, you know, they work on various initiatives

09:47.560 --> 09:53.600
within Red Hat that are, you know, that are, need people to learn these kind of new and

09:53.600 --> 09:57.040
old combinations of old and new skills.

09:57.040 --> 10:01.320
But the goal is to train these new people to work in those areas.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.840
So we also bring them in to help with our program and we've had people come in, they

10:04.840 --> 10:07.760
take the course and then they come in and they turn around and then they're TAs and

10:07.760 --> 10:09.200
they work on improving the course.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.080
Maybe they do a couple lectures here and there.

10:12.080 --> 10:17.000
They do some grading and they kind of service TAs.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.080
So another thing that we are doing is we have this kind of new kernel devs group within

10:22.080 --> 10:24.680
Red Hat, which I thought I'll just briefly mention.

10:24.680 --> 10:28.840
It's a little bit tangential, but, you know, once people get into Red Hat and when people

10:28.840 --> 10:35.520
are working in the kernel, especially in a remote job, which a lot of these positions

10:35.520 --> 10:41.560
are, people get very separated, they get very siloed, there's not a lot of socialization.

10:41.560 --> 10:46.160
So we run a group to, you know, just bring people together with, for a meeting with very

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
little agenda.

10:47.160 --> 10:51.160
You know, occasionally we have a presentation here and there, but just to talk about things

10:51.160 --> 10:57.160
and share concepts and tools and questions and, you know, it's a Red Hat specific thing,

10:57.160 --> 11:01.120
so they can ask about specific things related to their job and a place where, you know,

11:01.120 --> 11:05.200
there's, I mean, managers are allowed, but it's not a specific structured meeting for

11:05.200 --> 11:06.200
a business purpose.

11:06.200 --> 11:10.160
And I think people who, you know, you might get that in an office somewhere when you're

11:10.160 --> 11:14.520
just walking around and talking to people, but it's a little bit more difficult to get

11:14.520 --> 11:15.880
when you're in a remote position.

11:15.880 --> 11:21.520
So we also bring interns who we've recruited into that group, you know, and people from

11:21.520 --> 11:25.640
elsewhere within Red Hat who are interested in the kernel and they can ask questions and

11:25.640 --> 11:30.840
find resources and, you know, if they enjoy it, they can switch into the kernel.

11:30.840 --> 11:34.280
Because there are actually a number of people who are interested and they just don't know

11:34.280 --> 11:35.280
where to start.

11:35.280 --> 11:39.980
They're just not a lot of good resources.

11:39.980 --> 11:45.440
So now I'll talk about some of the growth of this program over the last couple of years.

11:45.440 --> 11:51.160
So first of all, we've partnered with Red Hat's main educational initiative, Red Hat Academy,

11:51.160 --> 11:54.720
which we found out about only through doing this program.

11:54.720 --> 12:00.400
But they work with universities mainly on delivering and facilitating kind of systems

12:00.400 --> 12:06.400
management, you know, what do you call it, system administration and cyber reliability

12:06.400 --> 12:12.400
engineering, kind of the more, you know, the standard kind of Red Hat certifications that

12:12.400 --> 12:13.920
they do.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.680
But they don't have much software engineering.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.840
In fact, I don't think they had any software engineering component at all.

12:18.840 --> 12:24.400
So they were happy to work with us and, you know, we're happy to work with them.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.480
And they made us these nice posters, which we have down here if anyone's interested.

12:28.480 --> 12:33.840
Or I guess they're called like leave behind sheets, technically.

12:33.840 --> 12:39.880
We also ran a workshop last year for interns and co-ops in Ireland.

12:39.880 --> 12:44.000
And that was just kind of every other week, kind of a casual thing, you know, over time

12:44.000 --> 12:45.960
we had fewer and fewer people, to be honest.

12:45.960 --> 12:50.240
But the people who stayed around really enjoyed it and I think hopefully some of them will

12:50.240 --> 12:56.480
end up working in the space or, you know, in open source generally, hopefully the feedback

12:56.480 --> 13:00.160
for them was generally fairly positive.

13:00.160 --> 13:03.600
We've also been connecting to various educational programs in different countries.

13:03.600 --> 13:07.560
A lot of this stuff's very preliminary, but we're hoping to kind of package what we've

13:07.560 --> 13:12.480
done in our course in a way that can be replicated at other places and other universities and

13:12.480 --> 13:16.200
other countries to bring people in from different places in the world.

13:16.200 --> 13:20.080
And then we've also partnered with the Linux Foundation, specifically their mentorship

13:20.080 --> 13:24.480
platform, which I will talk about next.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.760
So like I was saying, the Linux Foundation.

13:27.760 --> 13:36.600
So we have just put our course on the Linux Foundation's platform essentially as a mentorship,

13:36.600 --> 13:39.680
but it's the same thing as the course.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.400
We've worked with Shua Khan, she's been very helpful.

13:43.400 --> 13:48.360
She runs this Linux Foundation's mentorship platform and, you know, great person to get

13:48.360 --> 13:52.600
in touch with if you're interested in learning the kernel or have questions about this.

13:52.600 --> 13:57.280
She's also a kernel maintainer if you're not familiar.

13:57.280 --> 14:03.160
So we are running the same course, and this is kind of experimental, we're running the

14:03.160 --> 14:08.720
same schedule with the same assignments with a group who are doing the course for credit

14:08.720 --> 14:15.560
at UMass Lowell, and at the same time, people who are just, they just apply it online, and

14:15.560 --> 14:16.720
they're just doing it.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.800
There are people, you know, just on random continents, some of them are students, some

14:19.800 --> 14:24.560
of them are working, some of them are doing, you know, I have no idea, honestly, some of

14:24.560 --> 14:31.120
them are just probably, you know, having a good time, but they're doing the same assignments

14:31.120 --> 14:35.600
and on the same schedule, and, you know, they submit their assignments to a different mailing

14:35.600 --> 14:42.040
list than the UMass Lowell cohort, but they're in a shared Discord server and they're interacting,

14:42.040 --> 14:46.960
and, you know, we're seeing how that goes, and it's an extremely diverse group of mentees.

14:46.960 --> 14:52.480
We have people from, I think like five different continents, you know, people from various places

14:52.480 --> 14:57.920
in Europe, a couple in America, South America, someone in Mexico, like three or four from

14:57.920 --> 15:00.360
Africa, Nigeria, Kenya.

15:00.360 --> 15:06.720
So a very interesting group, a couple in India as well.

15:06.720 --> 15:10.080
So a couple of statistics on what we've been able to do.

15:10.080 --> 15:14.400
It's a fairly new program, but I am happy to show some results.

15:14.400 --> 15:20.280
We were able to hire two people full-time from internships who originally did the, went

15:20.280 --> 15:21.780
through the class.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.720
This was during a year that was very difficult to hire people.

15:23.720 --> 15:29.000
There was a hiring freeze, so I think two is still, it's a lot more than zero.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.340
Two people who did co-ops or internships with us were recruited to Amazon and Microsoft,

15:33.340 --> 15:36.760
but one of them liked Red Hat so much and liked working with Open Source so much better

15:36.760 --> 15:41.240
than Amazon that he is pretty interested in coming back, leaving Amazon and coming back

15:41.240 --> 15:43.920
to Red Hat, which is pretty cool.

15:43.920 --> 15:47.640
But overall, we've had seven interns and co-ops who have been trained and have gone

15:47.640 --> 15:52.800
through this particular program via this KDLP thing.

15:52.800 --> 15:57.400
And last semester, we had our biggest class, well, until this semester, we had 12 students,

15:57.400 --> 16:01.640
undergraduate, mostly graduate students, graduate and undergraduate courses are the same, which

16:01.640 --> 16:04.920
I found out, same content.

16:04.920 --> 16:08.680
And we have about a dozen, a couple more than a dozen students this semester, and the course

16:08.680 --> 16:09.960
is actively going on right now.

16:09.960 --> 16:15.800
It just started a couple of weeks ago, and I think about a dozen in the LFX mentorship

16:15.800 --> 16:16.800
as well.

16:16.800 --> 16:23.680
And this is by far the most diverse group by gender and location, which is pretty interesting.

16:23.680 --> 16:27.680
So now, just briefly, some program information.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.000
So the team is, well, it's me.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.280
Julie Denham is a program manager.

16:31.280 --> 16:36.360
I think she's in the chat answering questions, if anyone's interested, back in Boston.

16:36.360 --> 16:41.000
Charles Marabelle, he's the content lead for the course.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.920
And Dennis Alexandrov, he is an intern who's been extended and also TA.

16:45.920 --> 16:50.880
He's been working on the course since last summer, originally went through the course

16:50.880 --> 16:54.480
from McGill University.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.480
And yeah, acknowledgments.

16:55.480 --> 17:00.640
I just want to give a shout out to two Red Hatters in particular.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.720
First Heidi Dempsey, the research and innovation director in North America.

17:03.720 --> 17:07.480
She's been a longtime supporter of this program from the beginning, from like, you know, before

17:07.480 --> 17:11.200
it was even an idea, you know, when we were talking about doing something in, like, February

17:11.200 --> 17:12.200
2019.

17:12.200 --> 17:20.240
So her support's been great, and, you know, recommend, you know, doing research and innovation

17:20.240 --> 17:22.960
with her if anyone's, you know, interested in doing that.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.960
And of course, Mike McGrath, the vice president of RELL, who is the executive sponsor for

17:26.960 --> 17:29.920
this program within Red Hat.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.520
Now, a couple resources.

17:32.520 --> 17:37.360
We have a mailing list, which is linked up there, which we pretty much just used for

17:37.360 --> 17:41.320
giving a quarterly update newsletter, which we just started this quarter.

17:41.320 --> 17:45.520
And it's read only, so you're not going to get spammed with a ton of information.

17:45.520 --> 17:50.360
If you subscribe to that mailing list, you get invited to a weekly office hour session.

17:50.360 --> 17:56.480
That happens Tuesday at noon Eastern Standard Time, which just for asking questions about

17:56.480 --> 18:01.320
the program or the kernel in general, or you can just send me or one of us an email.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.120
And then on the right, we have our website.

18:03.120 --> 18:08.520
We have a section of our website that talks about the information, specifically the structure

18:08.520 --> 18:10.720
and content of the course.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.040
We have the page on the UMass Law Catalog that talks about the, you know, that just has

18:14.040 --> 18:18.640
a course description, so in case anyone's interested in checking that out.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.600
And the mentorship page on LFX.

18:21.600 --> 18:26.080
Then down there on the bottom right, we do have a crowdfunding page on LFX.

18:26.080 --> 18:32.320
If you want to support the program development and diverse engineers, it's a very, you know,

18:32.320 --> 18:37.160
we'll be able to bring people on through that platform as TAs, potentially give them, you

18:37.160 --> 18:41.760
know, bring them on and continue them kind of beyond what we're able to do with just

18:41.760 --> 18:42.760
Red Hat.

18:42.760 --> 18:49.760
All right, any questions?

18:49.760 --> 19:08.280
Hi, I think there is an offer and demand problem.

19:08.280 --> 19:14.520
If you consider every Linux developers, it will be like 1,000 JavaScript developers.

19:14.520 --> 19:19.000
And also people at the university, if you give them the choice between JavaScript and

19:19.000 --> 19:23.280
Linux, they will have more opportunities going with the JavaScript.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.280
They cannot do a mistake.

19:24.280 --> 19:28.960
However, if they go with the kernel, like, I don't know, in my country, for example, there's

19:28.960 --> 19:33.620
a lot of, there's a lot less jobs and you have less opportunities.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.200
So what's your opinion on this?

19:35.200 --> 19:44.040
Does people know the choice between like classic software development and kernel software development?

19:44.040 --> 19:51.400
So if I understand that correctly, you're saying there's fewer jobs in the kernel.

19:51.400 --> 19:58.760
And so, you know, what would I say about, just about what, it was like 1,000 to one

19:58.760 --> 20:05.640
or something, you said, well, I mean, that's true, but the competition for those jobs is

20:05.640 --> 20:06.640
much more intense.

20:06.640 --> 20:11.200
It's much kind of broader, you know, skill area.

20:11.200 --> 20:15.600
I mean, it's definitely, you know, I'm not condemning JavaScript developers.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.600
JavaScript's fine.

20:16.600 --> 20:20.920
It's necessary, you know, the web runs on it for all its problems.

20:20.920 --> 20:26.760
But it's also true that, I mean, working in the kernel, you know, the Linux kernel, there

20:26.760 --> 20:33.640
are fewer jobs, but there are a number of very solid jobs, and it doesn't, learning

20:33.640 --> 20:38.480
Linux kernel skills is somewhat transferable to other areas of development.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.480
You don't have to work as a Linux kernel developer.

20:40.480 --> 20:44.680
You don't have to, you know, go to Red Hat and work on RHEL and do backports or whatever.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.680
Right?

20:45.680 --> 20:46.680
You can kind of just do it on your own.

20:46.680 --> 20:51.760
You can do, you know, just some other low-level project and just having knowledge of the kernel

20:51.760 --> 20:55.560
and how it works and the knowledge necessary to work on the kernel, I think, could benefit

20:55.560 --> 21:01.760
people in many other areas and just is an overall boost to people's skills that is somewhat

21:01.760 --> 21:03.520
rare to find these days.

21:03.520 --> 21:06.800
So even for a JavaScript developer, if they know how the kernel works and if they know,

21:06.800 --> 21:11.480
you know, behind the scenes, you know, what's going on at a system level, I think that is,

21:11.480 --> 21:22.240
you know, can't be anything but a good thing.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.240
Thanks for the talk.

21:23.240 --> 21:29.040
I have a question about the audience, so is it mainly targeting students at the college

21:29.040 --> 21:34.080
level and then partnering with university, or do you also consider a conversion program

21:34.080 --> 21:38.960
like existing software developers that want to switch to more low-level kernel development?

21:38.960 --> 21:44.920
Yeah, so the course at UMass Lowell is, you know, a course at UMass Lowell for people

21:44.920 --> 21:48.720
enrolled at UMass Lowell, but the program on LFX, the whole idea of putting it on there

21:48.720 --> 21:54.720
is that we could accept people from anywhere in the world doing anything, students, non-students,

21:54.720 --> 21:57.080
you know, U.S., non-U.S., whatever.

21:57.080 --> 22:02.320
So any background, as long as they have some knowledge of C, good internet access, decent

22:02.320 --> 22:06.920
English and a computer, then we can take them.

22:06.920 --> 22:12.160
The only limitation is our ability to grade the assignments and handle that many students

22:12.160 --> 22:15.480
and like the resources that we have to work on the program, because this is, you know,

22:15.480 --> 22:19.800
for the three engineers and, you know, potentially a couple more people who are interested and,

22:19.800 --> 22:23.240
you know, a couple of interns, right, it's, this is all a side project for us.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.680
Like, I'm mainly a RELL engineer.

22:25.680 --> 22:26.680
That's my main job.

22:26.680 --> 22:30.720
Like, this is just a side project, so we don't have a ton of resources and, yeah, we're basically

22:30.720 --> 22:35.160
limited by how much time and resources we have to run the program.

22:35.160 --> 22:39.080
But we're, yeah, we encourage people to apply from all sorts of different backgrounds.

22:39.080 --> 22:49.680
Okay, thank you.

22:49.680 --> 22:55.960
So back in the day when I used to participate in the development of kernel, it required

22:55.960 --> 22:59.880
us to basically build the entire mainline.

22:59.880 --> 23:03.800
Your slide showed something with Raspberry Pis.

23:03.800 --> 23:08.960
Is it feasible to build the entire kernel using a Raspberry Pi?

23:08.960 --> 23:13.120
So, that originally comes from, we used to do a lot more stuff with Raspberry Pis before

23:13.120 --> 23:14.120
the chip shortage.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.880
It became more difficult to get them and then, you know, I think generally like a lot of

23:17.880 --> 23:24.720
the introductory stuff we were doing didn't require them as much, so we moved somewhat

23:24.720 --> 23:25.720
away from them.

23:25.720 --> 23:30.040
But, yes, we did work with Raspberry Pis and we were compiling the kernel on the Raspberry

23:30.040 --> 23:31.040
Pi.

23:31.040 --> 23:36.920
So I was able to do it on, on the three, it took a lot of weird tricks and it took like

23:36.920 --> 23:41.720
a day, you know, because I think it was like single threaded, and on the four, I could

23:41.720 --> 23:42.720
do it.

23:42.720 --> 23:46.720
It was a little bit faster, but if you didn't have cooling, the system would overheat unless

23:46.720 --> 23:49.640
you used fewer than four cores.

23:49.640 --> 23:54.200
But you can do it, and in fact, you can install Fedora, you can install CentOS, and you can

23:54.200 --> 23:55.200
install Rail.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.200
Oh, yeah.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.200
Yeah, I know that.

23:57.200 --> 24:04.200
Yeah, all right, that was my question, thank you.

24:04.200 --> 24:27.200
Hey, he had said, with the, the alternate, the non-university rate for doing it, you've

24:27.200 --> 24:32.680
got people here working at the same time, possibly, I was just wondering, since it's

24:32.680 --> 24:36.600
also, you've got the same assignment schedule, what is the time commitment like for someone

24:36.600 --> 24:40.160
trying to get into it, but might have full-time work?

24:40.160 --> 24:42.320
What is the time commitment like?

24:42.320 --> 24:47.360
Because it depends how quickly you complete the assignments.

24:47.360 --> 24:57.480
Okay, so it's, well, the, the lectures are the, the sessions that we have, which are,

24:57.480 --> 25:02.520
you know, on, on Google Meet, they're also recorded and we post them there about their

25:02.520 --> 25:08.040
two of them per week, generally, and they're, they're each an hour and 15 minutes, and it

25:08.040 --> 25:11.520
goes for, you know, like a standard 12-week semester.

25:11.520 --> 25:17.760
In terms of the assignments, I mean, if you're, you know, I think at the beginning, setting

25:17.760 --> 25:21.680
up the environment, send email patches, if you haven't done that before, and compiling

25:21.680 --> 25:25.920
the kernel, and, you know, we have one assignment where you write a shell, you know, that can

25:25.920 --> 25:31.520
be, I mean, yeah, it depends how familiar you are with, with some of the concepts.

25:31.520 --> 25:38.480
But, you know, I think of it as, it's just a, like, same commitment as a, you know, maybe

25:38.480 --> 25:44.880
medium to, like, junior to senior level undergraduate computer science course, approximately.

25:44.880 --> 25:49.200
I mean, that's, that's how we're designing it.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.200
Sure.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.520
Hiya, thanks for the talk.

25:53.520 --> 25:58.880
Any of these courses, like, I'm, I'm curious about back, back-porting and forward-porting

25:58.880 --> 25:59.880
stuff.

25:59.880 --> 26:04.000
So, when, when, when you're doing this course work, are you working on a specific version

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
of the kernel?

26:05.000 --> 26:10.640
Like, yeah, this course is going to be on 6.2, because I find that a lot of problems that

26:10.640 --> 26:15.920
I run into is, okay, this driver was just introduced, let's say, in October, but I need

26:15.920 --> 26:22.160
it on 5.13, so I need to back-port it, and that might be trivial, right, might just be

26:22.160 --> 26:27.440
copying some files, but if the API has changed in some way, it can be really difficult to

26:27.440 --> 26:32.760
figure out how it changed, because the documentation, to my knowledge, is not great there.

26:32.760 --> 26:39.280
So, is that some, something that you actually sort of discuss in these courses?

26:39.280 --> 26:42.560
We haven't done back-porting specifically.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.200
We don't, I don't think we even, we don't have any assignments that's specifically

26:45.200 --> 26:50.000
asked for, for back-ports, because we have to, we design them in a way that, you know,

26:50.000 --> 26:53.520
each student is doing, like, relatively unique work, so it's kind of, you know, and they're

26:53.520 --> 26:58.920
all posting it in a, in a public mailing list, so, you know, we need to figure out how we

26:58.920 --> 27:04.240
can kind of either generate assignments or, or figure out assignments that are basically

27:04.240 --> 27:09.560
by design, difficult to impossible to, to just, to cheat in.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.960
And so, so with back-porting, I mean, we could figure something out.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.120
We haven't really looked into it.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.480
We talk about, you know, get cherry-pick and rebase, and we talk about the, the background

27:17.480 --> 27:22.640
that you would need to do that, and I think we may have done a demonstration of it in

27:22.640 --> 27:23.640
the course.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.640
But that's a good idea.

27:26.640 --> 27:41.440
Do you anticipate that the recent admission of Rust as a programming language, at least

27:41.440 --> 27:46.280
for driver development in the Linux kernel, will cause renewed interest, especially among

27:46.280 --> 27:47.560
younger talent?

27:47.560 --> 27:50.680
And are you already anticipating for that in the program?

27:50.680 --> 27:54.200
Potentially, yeah, we've, we've discussed it, and we've heard some people talking about

27:54.200 --> 27:55.200
it.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.360
We had a few people who were in the course, who were excited about Rust, and Rust in

27:58.360 --> 27:59.360
the kernel.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.920
So we, we have seen some interest in the kernel.

28:01.920 --> 28:07.320
Probably, yeah, it's probably increased interest from young people, I would say.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.120
But personally, I need to, I need to learn Rust.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.120
I don't know Rust.

28:10.120 --> 28:31.640
Do you mind if I do a little bit of, oh, sure, yeah, they're here, but people take us

28:31.640 --> 29:00.760
with them.

29:00.760 --> 29:08.000
where you were asked, you know, to work on vice-drivers and then, you know, non-handling

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
veterans and so on, actually, when we fly, so they were teaching us since, I think it's

29:14.000 --> 29:20.000
never been more, you know, for the people, maybe like, what are you, and you're a serious

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
person.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
I mean, I'm probably fine.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Sorry, let me get the mic away from you.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Oh, okay.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Yeah.

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
All right.
