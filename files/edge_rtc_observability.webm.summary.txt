The speaker is an open source enthusiast and CTO of QXAP, a company behind open source projects such as Homer and HAPK that help monitor systems. The speaker introduced Quirin, a new application solution that collects data in special formats from Grafana, Prometheus, and Elasticsearch to store metrics, logs, and traces for the user. The collected data can be displayed automatically in query with lightning-fast speed using open telemetry and can use eBPF or JAWS for tracing. Quirin also supports fraud detection and alert management. Lastly, the speaker shared how they successfully installed HEPLIFI agents on Open5G stacks and sent information to Quirin to trace packets.
