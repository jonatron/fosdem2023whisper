In this talk, Pedro Holanda introduces DuckDB, an open-source database system designed for analytical queries. He explains that DuckDB was created as a solution to the transfer cost problem of using traditional database systems for data science projects. DuckDB is an embedded database system that can run within a Python process, eliminating the need for data transfer. Pedro discusses the main characteristics of DuckDB, including columnar data storage, compression techniques, vectorized execution, end-to-end core optimization, parallelism, and beyond-memory execution. He also demonstrates how DuckDB integrates with the Python ecosystem and showcases a demo using the New York City taxi dataset. Pedro concludes by summarizing the key features of DuckDB, its compatibility with various programming languages, and its SQL support.
