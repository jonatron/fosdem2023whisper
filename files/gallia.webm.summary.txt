Stefan presented GALIA, an extendable penetration testing framework for the automotive domain. The tool features a UDS stack including DOIP or ISOTP, ready-to-use scanning modules such as discovery, machine-readable logging available as JSON and SQL, and a plugin interface. The tool is implemented in Python and aims to be the end map for cars. Stefan concludes with the hope for more testing, packages, and plugins in the future.
