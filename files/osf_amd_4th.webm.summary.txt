They mention the dropping of several platforms from the Coreboot master branch and the need for a new strategy to support AMD platforms in the long term. They introduce the Shara firmware project as a community-driven effort to provide support for old AMD platforms. They also announce the end of official PC engines open source firmware support, but mention their commitment to continue improving the PC engines firmware under the Shara branch. They mention upcoming events and invite the audience to join the Shara community. The talk concludes with a Q&A session where the speaker addresses questions about the development process, future plans, and the challenges faced in getting patches upstreamed.
