The talk gave an overview of the secure boot state in arm-based systems-on-a-chip (SoCs). It discussed the typical implementation and workflow of secure boot in these SoCs, as well as the results from a previous edition of the presentation. The speaker then delved into specific cases and updates, including NXP, Marvell Armada, NVIDIA Tegra, Rockchip, and Allwinner. They highlighted the availability and quality of documentation, the need for NDAs in some cases, and vulnerabilities found in certain platforms. They concluded by summarizing the expanding knowledge on secure boot in arm-based SoCs, the common principles across vendors, and the challenges with documentation.
