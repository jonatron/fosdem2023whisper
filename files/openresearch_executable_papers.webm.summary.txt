The University of Luxembourg's Center for Contemporary Digital History has collaborated with The Groiter, an open-access publisher, to create a new journal of digital history, with a particular focus on reproducible papers in the humanities. The model for the journal is one of a braided narrative, which advocates the bringing together of narrative and argumentation with the interpretation of data. To achieve this, materials are presented in a number of multilayered arrangements. The journals, which are aimed at academia, require a high threshold of technical expertise.
