WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.680
Great. Yeah. Sorry for the old, the usual show. I'm sure you're used to it now. Great

00:11.680 --> 00:18.520
to see so many people here. Amazing. Thanks for your interest in the Co-op Cloud. Yeah,

00:18.520 --> 00:24.440
I'm decentralized. That's my internet name. And these are my enterprise slides for the

00:24.440 --> 00:31.240
Co-op Clouds. So I've been working on this project now for, yeah, maybe two to three

00:31.240 --> 00:39.320
years, I would say. So there's a lot of knowledge of the project, how it happened, and what came

00:39.320 --> 00:44.400
to pass locked up in my head. But I am only one person involved in this project, what has now

00:44.400 --> 00:49.680
become quite a wonderful project, I'd say, which involves a lot of different collectors, a lot of

00:49.680 --> 00:54.840
different groups. So yeah, this is just kind of like a moment to offload what we've been up to for

00:54.840 --> 01:04.040
the last two years. And yeah, all the hot takes are mine alone. Some of the images are taken from,

01:04.040 --> 01:10.960
yeah, shout out to fellow worker Trav, the internet gardening collection on Arena. I totally

01:10.960 --> 01:20.640
recommend checking that out. It's great. So yeah, Co-op Cloud. This is the official website ready

01:20.640 --> 01:25.800
description of what the Co-op Cloud is, a software stack that aims to make hosting Libre software

01:25.800 --> 01:30.840
applications simple for small service providers, such as tech co-ops who are looking to standardize

01:30.840 --> 01:38.320
around open, transparent, and scalable infrastructure, which is a lot. So I was thinking, how am I

01:38.320 --> 01:43.240
going to explain this? Because we come straight in with a software stack, but actually, it's much

01:43.240 --> 01:48.720
more than that. I think you could argue our project is more a social endeavor, social organizing,

01:48.720 --> 01:54.160
more than a technical thing. But of course, they're overlapping. So I thought, well, okay,

01:54.160 --> 02:03.240
we'll just go back. We'll do a history lesson on how the project started. And I feel like that is an

02:03.240 --> 02:10.080
important angle for introducing the project. So I want you to understand where the project is

02:10.080 --> 02:14.760
coming from. And then maybe you feel welcome to join the project and shape the future of the

02:14.760 --> 02:22.600
project, right? And I think this historical view on where things are coming helps to ground the

02:22.600 --> 02:29.080
project in an actual need, human need. There's a lot of software projects out there that are just

02:29.080 --> 02:37.720
like, why does this exist? But we're trying to show that this is socially useful and why we have

02:37.720 --> 02:44.600
come up with this project and initiated and tried to make it work is based on what we needed at

02:44.600 --> 02:53.440
the time. But that may necessarily be the case in the future. So yeah, put that to one side. And let

02:53.440 --> 03:00.400
me introduce you to the magic brain of autonomic co op. So these are some people in the cop. There's

03:00.400 --> 03:07.560
me on the banjo. That's not all of them. There's 13 of us. As far as I remember, we have a new

03:07.560 --> 03:12.000
website that was just put up last night. So check it out. It's hilarious. I don't know if I can

03:12.000 --> 03:19.520
get up here, but I'll try maybe at some point. So yeah, we're a technology cooperative, a worker

03:19.520 --> 03:23.200
owned cooperative. That means the people who work in the business own the business. It's run and

03:23.200 --> 03:32.480
managed by ourselves. And that means we're, yeah, this is like, you know, we when we come into where

03:32.480 --> 03:38.320
we work, we have the chance to make decisions about every aspect of how the workplace runs. So, you

03:38.320 --> 03:43.680
know, what kind of work do we want to do? How do we want to make decisions? How do we deal with

03:43.680 --> 03:49.920
money? How do we find new work? Who do we want to work with? Another member wants to work with this

03:49.920 --> 03:54.480
group, but someone else disagrees with that. How do we work this out? How do we deal with conflict?

03:55.280 --> 04:03.760
It's kind of an end to end workplace situation where you have the chance to, you know, be involved

04:03.760 --> 04:09.360
in every step of the process. And of course, you don't have to do that alone. You can do that with

04:09.360 --> 04:18.880
your friends. So that's the kind of model of the cooperative. Yeah, and one of the kind of,

04:21.040 --> 04:30.880
yeah, I'll come back to the website maybe in a bit. But so one of the ideas behind what a cooperative

04:30.880 --> 04:38.000
is, is this listing of cooperative principles. You can see them on the right hand side there.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.200
For example, autonomy, independence, you know, economic participation of the members,

04:43.200 --> 04:47.440
open voluntary membership. These are kind of like non-binding principles of what it means to be a

04:47.440 --> 04:53.840
co-op. Principle six, for example, that you will work with other co-ops. So, you know, we want to

04:53.840 --> 05:00.880
expand cooperation in the ecosystem of groups that are trying to do this as well. And a lot of

05:00.880 --> 05:10.160
these hinge on actually having money to survive in order to practice what it means to be a

05:10.160 --> 05:17.280
cooperative. So we're a technology cooperative. And what do we do exactly? And you could kind of

05:17.280 --> 05:22.880
say we do basically everything and anything like we would happily develop a new piece of software,

05:22.880 --> 05:29.360
but we'd also come to your house and fix your toaster. We, you know, we try to work with people

05:29.360 --> 05:33.840
that we want to work with, that we want to support, that we like their work, or that connect with

05:33.840 --> 05:41.040
our values. And one of the things we've done quite successfully, in my opinion, is to run a free

05:41.040 --> 05:47.920
software step internally and for the people we work with. So we have like, you know, all the

05:47.920 --> 05:54.640
things we use our free software. So we're pretty good at that, managing our own internal infrastructure.

05:54.640 --> 06:03.920
And so necessarily, we would then just offer that to groups, like, do you want a website? Do you want

06:03.920 --> 06:08.720
your own chat system, like a matrix, or do you want a wiki, or do you want an xCloud, or whatever

06:08.720 --> 06:16.880
this kind of stuff, this classic hosting situation. And one of these problems that has come up,

06:16.880 --> 06:22.560
Autonomic is running like several years now, five years or so, is that it's difficult to make money

06:22.560 --> 06:28.640
out of. People are used to just getting stuff for free for very understandable reasons. Big tech.

06:30.320 --> 06:35.360
And at some point, you know, we want to scale out the code, we want to involve more people, we want

06:35.360 --> 06:40.720
to be able to make a living from it, we want to be able to survive, pay the rent and so on. And

06:40.720 --> 06:45.120
then we started realizing that, okay, actually, we're making more money, or people are happy to

06:45.120 --> 06:52.320
pay us more when we are doing support. And this is talking to people, getting on a call and being

06:52.320 --> 06:57.680
like, what is software, and then talking about it, or what is a wiki, everyone's saying wiki,

06:57.680 --> 07:05.040
I don't know what a wiki is. And just having a chat about it. But then also, being around later,

07:05.040 --> 07:11.600
so once they ask for the thing, like an xCloud, you set it up, and then you don't disappear because

07:12.160 --> 07:17.360
you're a cooperative, and you intend to continue. So sustainability is one of the core principles.

07:17.360 --> 07:26.480
So we stick with them, we chat, we're contact on mail and so on. So this is kind of the dilemma

07:26.480 --> 07:31.840
of like, we want to definitely do more hosting, because people need digital infrastructure to

07:31.840 --> 07:38.560
do their work. This is just like a base layer of how to organize things. But it's difficult to survive

07:39.360 --> 07:44.240
as a technology cooperative, only doing hosting. So you need to like expand what you do.

07:44.240 --> 07:52.240
And one of the places we ended up was using Cloudron, which is a kind of like,

07:53.360 --> 08:00.160
one click install open source system, which I would still recommend. It's great. It got us really

08:00.160 --> 08:04.400
far. A lot of the next slides criticized us. So I'm just going to say it's great on this slide.

08:07.840 --> 08:13.280
So you can see like, you have your classic selection of open source apps, if you're familiar

08:13.280 --> 08:17.440
with that stuff, like Rocket Chat, for example, we use Rocket Chat to communicate where, you know,

08:17.440 --> 08:28.000
in the co-op. And what this enabled us to do was basically work with different groups that may not

08:28.000 --> 08:33.360
necessarily have money to support us, like to make it sustainable to work with them,

08:35.280 --> 08:40.000
but still support them to do their work. And Cloudron was like a really kind of like,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.240
get out of jail card in that sense. It was like, okay, I can just like hit five times

08:44.240 --> 08:48.320
on this WordPress button. And we've got five WordPress sites and people are going,

08:48.320 --> 08:51.680
they're posting, they're organizing, they're working, we're supporting them. It's brilliant.

08:53.280 --> 08:59.200
You know, and for those that don't know, Cloudron is just like, you fire up a server,

08:59.200 --> 09:06.240
you SSH into it, you run a command, it spins up this thing. And you're going, you can install

09:06.240 --> 09:12.640
multiple apps on the same server. So this really reduces the costs for rolling out digital

09:12.640 --> 09:25.440
infrastructure. Let me check time. Sorry. Yes. Right. So yeah, remember I said at Cloudron school,

09:25.440 --> 09:34.400
but at some point, the core of the product, the front end, the web front end became proprietary.

09:34.400 --> 09:38.800
So they made a switch. In some sense, I can't blame them because, as I said, if you want to

09:38.800 --> 09:43.680
survive, you need to make a book and you need to pay the rent and so on. But yeah, that made us

09:43.680 --> 09:50.160
nervous. You know, when we work with people as a cooperative, we want to say, we'll be around

09:50.160 --> 09:55.280
for you. We want to continue. We want to do this sustainably. And if you remember one of the

09:55.280 --> 10:02.000
principles is like our independence, like how, like, can we exist in this world? You know,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.760
there's, of course, interdependencies, but like, can we continue to do what we want to do

10:05.760 --> 10:12.960
without relying on one specific thing? So when this, so Cloudron made the decision to make the

10:12.960 --> 10:18.320
front end proprietary, you can still use it or whatever. It's a great system. But we thought,

10:18.320 --> 10:28.240
oh no, what's going to happen? And then we started looking a bit deeper. And we realized that

10:28.240 --> 10:38.320
Cloudron, when you click and install an app, the apps are, yeah, they're, it's an image. So it

10:38.320 --> 10:44.160
uses a container system. It's kind of like a light virtualization layer. They're packaging

10:45.200 --> 10:51.600
all the apps themselves. So the people who work in Cloudron Inc. or whatever, when they want to

10:51.600 --> 10:58.880
provide a new app, they say, okay, let's make a new Git repository and let's package this thing.

10:59.120 --> 11:04.720
And that's great. And it works really well. But then we realized that they had packaged,

11:04.720 --> 11:10.080
I can't remember specific apps, but take, for example, NextCloud. They had gone and some

11:10.080 --> 11:14.640
worker in Cloudron had packaged NextCloud. But then we went to the upstream NextCloud repository

11:14.640 --> 11:19.760
and we saw they had provided an image. And then we thought, well, why aren't we just working with

11:19.760 --> 11:24.640
them? Because that would, you know, connect our values of expanding cooperation in different

11:24.640 --> 11:30.400
layers of the software stack and so on. And then the more we looked, we realized that free

11:30.400 --> 11:37.120
software communities were really converging on the idea that you have a packaged image inside your

11:37.120 --> 11:41.120
repository. So you're hacking on your source code, and you just have an image that's building.

11:41.680 --> 11:46.560
And we can use that. That's what Cloudron needs. So we were like, okay, that's interesting. Maybe

11:46.560 --> 11:54.560
let's think about that. Yeah. And then the kind of like, the end of the, the logical end of the

11:54.560 --> 12:03.440
paranoia or whatever it was that like, we have, you know, we're relying on this one company,

12:03.440 --> 12:13.120
this one group, you know, autonomic is a cooperative that supports maybe 20 plus groups,

12:13.120 --> 12:18.880
but like a large selection of them have very little money to pay for the infrastructure.

12:18.880 --> 12:23.680
So if you can imagine that Cloudron would somehow make a bigger step into more proprietary

12:23.680 --> 12:29.440
solutions or somehow increase the cost or who knows what, we'd be in a position where we can

12:29.440 --> 12:36.080
support those groups. And that's not something we wanted to, to deal with. So we, we started to try

12:36.080 --> 12:43.680
to think like, you know, we're a co-op, how do we make this better or whatever. And that is the

12:43.680 --> 12:50.560
start of call clouds. So now we're getting back into another take on that original really long

12:50.560 --> 12:57.280
sentence that had things like software sack in it. Yeah, we were like, let's just eliminate this

12:57.280 --> 13:03.280
issue of proprietary, you know, angles or whatever. Oh yeah, here's where I just couldn't get the

13:03.280 --> 13:09.760
emoji in the slide. So I just gave up. I, yeah, we're just like, we'll just copy left the entire

13:09.760 --> 13:17.040
thing. Let's just do that. That seems sensible. Cool. And then as I mentioned, yeah, you have

13:17.040 --> 13:24.560
a little favorite emoji. We want to work with the upstream developers of the software because

13:26.640 --> 13:31.600
a lot of precarity is in the open source ecosystem and that there's, you know, certain

13:31.600 --> 13:36.480
developers which are doing unpaid labor to develop the software that a lot of us rely on.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.320
And they're providing these, you know, a lot of them are providing these packages and we thought,

13:42.320 --> 13:49.200
well, okay, we can just meet them where they're at, engage with them on the issue tracker,

13:49.920 --> 13:56.560
you know, speak to them, make them aware of our hosting efforts. And, you know, we're, we're in

13:56.560 --> 14:04.640
a sense like closer to end users in that, you know, it's like developers, posters, users,

14:05.840 --> 14:10.800
you know, summarized and often developers, well, they've got their hands full trying to

14:10.800 --> 14:15.280
make the software work so we can like help that connection. So we're trying to bridge that in

14:15.280 --> 14:24.640
that sense. And also, which we'll see later on, they're also providing, so they're packaging up

14:24.640 --> 14:32.320
their apps in images, but they're also providing this kind of extra configuration around it,

14:32.320 --> 14:37.040
which kind of tells you how to deploy the thing, which is great for people who are doing hosting

14:37.040 --> 14:42.080
because, okay, we have an app, but does it need a database, for example? So what, database?

14:43.360 --> 14:47.440
But they're also doing that for us as well. So if you develop open source software, thank you.

14:47.440 --> 14:55.760
Yeah. And then the democratic governance. We were going to initiate this project,

14:55.760 --> 15:00.480
let's say. I wouldn't say we like invented it, we just like collude a bunch of stuff together.

15:03.200 --> 15:09.840
But we wanted to not be in control of that. So not become the new cloud run, which is like,

15:09.840 --> 15:15.440
okay, let's set up some clear rules for how do you interact with this project and also

15:15.440 --> 15:22.000
on what basis are you also a technology cooperative? Are you an open source developer? Are you a user

15:22.000 --> 15:26.240
of this software? Do you want to support the host or do you want to support the... We can

15:26.240 --> 15:33.040
start to engage with it where we're at, but meet in this kind of common project. And obviously,

15:33.040 --> 15:42.320
the goal then is to sustain open source digital infrastructure and expand cooperation.

15:42.320 --> 15:51.040
Yeah. So moving out of the kind of history phase and now into what it actually is.

15:54.400 --> 16:01.360
Yes. So this word kind of pops up if you've checked the website or the docs,

16:01.360 --> 16:13.520
democratic tech collectives. So what is that actually? Autonomic is a... We're

16:13.520 --> 16:17.760
probably registered in the UK. We're publicly regulated. We're a cooperative society.

16:19.280 --> 16:24.080
We have gone through the paperwork to make that happen because we wanted to do that.

16:24.080 --> 16:31.920
But we recognize that not everyone will want to do that or be able to do that.

16:33.200 --> 16:38.080
And this really depends on a per country basis. If you're in the Netherlands,

16:38.080 --> 16:43.520
it's a different model or if you're in the UK, the way you relate to the legal system and the

16:43.520 --> 16:48.000
state is like... In Germany, it's quite difficult. I've been told there's no way to

16:48.000 --> 16:55.920
kind of just slot yourself in. It's not very easy to find information.

16:57.360 --> 17:02.560
And we don't want that to be a limiting factor in working together. So we were trying to

17:02.560 --> 17:10.080
conceptualize this idea of what other groups would we be willing to work with but not close

17:10.080 --> 17:20.880
that definition down from the outside. So we were thinking about other groups who want to work

17:20.880 --> 17:25.040
with their friends or together with other groups and have set up decision making, for example,

17:25.040 --> 17:29.760
collective decision making. So they're able to navigate what they want to do together.

17:31.280 --> 17:35.280
That was kind of like a thing we wanted to do. We wanted to be able to interact with each other.

17:35.280 --> 17:41.040
We wanted to be able to disagree and receive and send constructive feedback, reach compromise,

17:41.040 --> 17:46.720
stuff like this. This is kind of easier to do when people are already organized in their own groups.

17:47.840 --> 17:53.600
But yeah, this didn't really rule out individuals who are active in the project at the moment

17:54.320 --> 18:00.160
and also other technology cooperatives. We're kind of just trying to saddle through it somehow

18:00.160 --> 18:05.840
and be like, just work with us. Let's figure it out together. And this is already in progress.

18:05.840 --> 18:11.680
This has been in progress for some time, the formalization of what this means. And that's

18:11.680 --> 18:19.360
an open process, which would love to invite you to come check out. The configuration commons,

18:20.800 --> 18:27.200
this is a, so as I said before, we have open source apps that we can package them in images.

18:27.200 --> 18:33.680
And then we can specify a configuration around those images to describe how that app should look

18:33.680 --> 18:40.880
like in a deployment on a server live and well, people using it. And one of the things we know

18:40.880 --> 18:47.120
is was that the, as I said before, the configuration that was being provided by the upstream repositories

18:48.480 --> 18:55.600
was useful, but it didn't specify the full end-to-end production kind of scenario.

18:55.600 --> 19:01.600
And that's kind of a big word, but for example, how to back up the app data. Like the thing is

19:01.600 --> 19:06.080
deployed, people are using it and we need to make sure their data is safe. So we need to back it up.

19:06.080 --> 19:11.840
How do we back the thing up? How do we restore it? This is kind of like a step from it works to

19:12.640 --> 19:18.240
it works and it's safe for these people to use it. And we wanted to encapsulate that into our

19:18.240 --> 19:26.240
configuration. So this is a big part of it. We'll go through each one of these deeper. I'm just

19:26.240 --> 19:32.240
going to overview them now. Yeah, ABRA is a command line tool. So our own digital tools, we wanted

19:32.240 --> 19:40.240
to be involved in how the tools are shaped and how we use them. You know, that's a great situation

19:40.240 --> 19:44.240
where you're dogfruiting your own system with your peers and you're trying to figure out how does

19:44.240 --> 19:50.240
this, how does this, you know, best suit us, you know, and according to our own constraints,

19:50.240 --> 19:56.240
you know, we can't spend all day learning this obscure system or we can't, you know,

19:56.240 --> 20:02.240
invest too much time in some things. So we need to cut corners and it's best to be involved directly

20:02.240 --> 20:10.240
in that process. So, yeah, and if we remember back to Cloud Run again, sorry, I'm not going to be

20:10.240 --> 20:16.240
bashing them at all. But yeah, like, how do we interact with the system? In the case of Cloud Run,

20:16.240 --> 20:24.240
it was a web front end. But if we're talking about interacting with technology cooperatives

20:24.240 --> 20:30.240
and other tech collectives, there's kind of a difference to begin with because Cloud Run is maybe

20:30.240 --> 20:35.240
trying to provide for the, say, let's say, non-technical user or someone who can just kind of get

20:35.240 --> 20:41.240
in and click a few buttons or whatever. But we're already dealing with groups that are actively,

20:41.240 --> 20:46.240
like, you know, deeply involved with like Linux system administration and so on. So do we need a

20:46.240 --> 20:55.240
front end? So those are the kind of questions we can ask and answer them ourselves in those moments.

20:55.240 --> 21:04.240
And the collective infrastructure. So there's a lot that goes on in between getting an app out

21:04.240 --> 21:10.240
and someone using it. You know, people have to meet each other and talk and who are you and

21:10.240 --> 21:15.240
what's going on and what do you do and all this kind of stuff. And then money. Where does the money

21:15.240 --> 21:20.240
go? Who, you know, what do you charge? You know, it's just this end to end, all the social process

21:20.240 --> 21:26.240
that go in and around that. We wanted to build those up too because that is a huge problem when

21:26.240 --> 21:30.240
you're starting off as a collective and you're like, oh, no, where's my bank account? Like, how do

21:30.240 --> 21:35.240
I get a bank account? And you can see like open collective, for example, doing this, just like

21:35.240 --> 21:43.240
mutualizing this financial infrastructure and just getting people going. So yeah, docs, yeah,

21:43.240 --> 21:51.240
get hosting, get off GitHub. That's cool. Stuff like that. So I'm going to go through these a

21:51.240 --> 22:02.240
bit deeper. Yeah, we're trying to form so we're our proposal at the moment as autonomic, which is,

22:02.240 --> 22:09.240
yeah, now I can say the sentence and I hope it's a bit clear. We initiated this project and we're

22:09.240 --> 22:15.240
deeply embedded inside it, but we're attempting to step out of the project and reenter on an equal

22:15.240 --> 22:22.240
basis with other collectives. So in order to do that, we're proposing a federation model, which is

22:22.240 --> 22:30.240
based on a great project called Co-op Cycle, if you've heard of it, but basically different groups

22:30.240 --> 22:35.240
can interact with each other. There will be democratic decision making and yeah, some laws and

22:35.240 --> 22:40.240
we'll come up with a constitution together and all this kind of stuff. I couldn't fit in on this

22:40.240 --> 22:48.240
line, but it's not just chaotic nerds, it's also open to, you know, we can imagine the people who are

22:48.240 --> 22:55.240
using the software grouping together and joining our federation as well to say, hey, this button

22:55.240 --> 23:01.240
should be over there. Could you just fix that? But in a more collective sense, like we could be

23:01.240 --> 23:06.240
gathering money, we could be figuring out how to improve things, you know, you don't have to be

23:06.240 --> 23:12.240
able to just write software to join this kind of stuff. We could be, you know, connecting the

23:12.240 --> 23:22.240
different struggles to build up like a better open source ecosystem. So this is a process that's

23:22.240 --> 23:28.240
going on right now. There's invites going out. We have a new round of private funding. Thank you

23:28.240 --> 23:34.240
private funder and yeah, there'll be more news. But check the website if you're interested in this,

23:34.240 --> 23:42.240
if you're also part of a collective love to hear from you. This is a massive problem that we, of

23:42.240 --> 23:48.240
course, experiences being sys admins. And we've seen a lot of people join in on the old matrix

23:48.240 --> 23:57.240
channels. And, you know, that'd be one person setting up a few apps for friends, family, maybe

23:57.240 --> 24:02.240
their local community, food co-op, what have you. And then a few months down the line, it's

24:02.240 --> 24:09.240
completely overwhelming. The email broke, you know, or it doesn't do this, or who knows what. If you

24:09.240 --> 24:16.240
do any sys admin, you'll know the story. But when you step into the co-cloud project, you have this

24:16.240 --> 24:22.240
chance to meet your peers who are also doing this work. They may not be involved in your project

24:22.240 --> 24:30.240
whatsoever, but that's not important. We have this idea of the config comments that means we can

24:30.240 --> 24:37.240
share work on the, again, the next cloud recipe, that's what we call them, we'll come to that in a

24:37.240 --> 24:45.240
bit. So we can work together on the same configuration. And that means we're sharing tips,

24:45.240 --> 24:50.240
tricks, we're talking together, you know, it's like this group of users wants this, do you want

24:50.240 --> 24:56.240
that, oh, I tried this, you know, this kind of stuff. And this is really, yeah, this has been

24:56.240 --> 25:02.240
seen to be like a great feature of trying to just like open the door for people to come in and

25:02.240 --> 25:13.240
work together. Because there's a lot of tools that propose reuse and kind of mind share and a, you

25:13.240 --> 25:24.240
know, collective point of reference, but don't really live up to that, you know, the ideal of

25:24.240 --> 25:30.240
reuse, just not doing it again, you know, repeating yourself. So we were conscious of that, we're

25:30.240 --> 25:37.240
trying to work on that. Yeah, folks on training collaboration, so we wanted it to be easy to

25:37.240 --> 25:42.240
onboard, we want more democratic tech collectors to pop up, we want more technology

25:42.240 --> 25:47.240
cooperatives to be able to start, we want people to be able to decide, I want to own and run my

25:47.240 --> 25:53.240
own workplace, and I want to, you know, bootstrap some infrastructure for groups, I find cool in

25:53.240 --> 26:01.240
my city. And that's what called cloud is about, it's like a tool set for these people. It has to be

26:01.240 --> 26:08.240
easy to use, of course, and we're very focused on that public, so groups who have already decided

26:08.240 --> 26:14.240
that that's what they want to do. They're on the terminal at the moment, we only have the

26:14.240 --> 26:18.240
terminal clients, and they're, you know, they're getting into that, you know, we can't do

26:18.240 --> 26:24.240
everything for everyone, but we can definitely, with that public in mind, we can, you know, be

26:24.240 --> 26:31.240
focused on how we attempt to make it accessible and usable. And yes, cooperating with other

26:31.240 --> 26:37.240
networks, so we want to, you know, within our network, of course, we want to have groups

26:37.240 --> 26:41.240
join, but for the groups that don't want to join, we still want to work with them, if they

26:41.240 --> 26:45.240
have the same values, if they're doing similar things, we can also interface with them. And we've

26:45.240 --> 26:54.240
already seen that happening, and I'll come back to that in a bit, but, you know, once things are

26:54.240 --> 26:59.240
clear, and they're getting clear, like we are a group of cooperators, we have this configuration

26:59.240 --> 27:03.240
columns, we have these tools, we're just like specifying what we are, then it's easier for

27:03.240 --> 27:08.240
other groups to say, okay, I understand what's happening here, and I would like to do this

27:08.240 --> 27:14.240
with you. So there's kind of like, you know, a concrete example, find funding together.

27:14.240 --> 27:26.240
So, yeah. The concrete commons, yes, the open source apps you love. If you, it's this

27:26.240 --> 27:32.240
catalog of software that is out there, and people are developing the next cloud, the

27:32.240 --> 27:40.240
media wikis, the seen apps, the GTIA, the whole thing. So we have quite an expanding

27:40.240 --> 27:47.240
concrete commons, so you can, like, deploy a lot of apps. So that's the thing, like,

27:47.240 --> 27:51.240
people come to us, and they're like, oh, I need a calendar, or oh, I need, you know, a

27:51.240 --> 27:56.240
note-taking app, or whatever, and then we're out hunting in the open source ecosystem for apps

27:56.240 --> 28:05.240
to add to the catalog. So that's that, then the, yeah, so to come back to the, you know,

28:05.240 --> 28:10.240
this, again, this idea of the image is the app, which is the packaged thing, and then

28:10.240 --> 28:15.240
the kind of wrapper around that, which specifies the end-to-end kind of how they should look

28:15.240 --> 28:24.240
in production. And we were conscious to not reinvent a packaging format, and we didn't

28:24.240 --> 28:30.240
really know what to do at that point, because we thought, okay, we need to be able to say

28:30.240 --> 28:36.240
how, you know, in one file, let's say, in plain text, a config file, like, here's the

28:36.240 --> 28:39.240
app, and how do you back it up, how do you restore it, how do you take it down, how do

28:39.240 --> 28:44.240
you bring it up, how do you configure, how do you plug it, you know, this kind of stuff.

28:44.240 --> 28:52.240
Yeah, and as it turns out, the Docker compose ecosystem and Docker has kind of been moving

28:52.240 --> 28:57.240
towards the compose standard they're calling it, and it's basically, yeah, if you've ever

28:57.240 --> 29:03.240
seen the Docker compose file, it's a YAML text file, and it kind of just specifies what

29:03.240 --> 29:11.240
we're looking for. So we just figured, great, upstream developers are already using this,

29:11.240 --> 29:19.240
this is a developing open standard, great, let's just build on this. And I think as it

29:19.240 --> 29:24.240
turns out, that was a good choice and has had many benefits, which we'll come to on the

29:24.240 --> 29:33.240
next slide. Yeah, so we're working with upstream developers, and yeah, we're, so in my background,

29:33.240 --> 29:38.240
I've done a lot of configuration management tool, like for example, working with Ansible,

29:38.240 --> 29:44.240
which was always the grand ideal of reusing roles, if anyone has been, has used Ansible

29:44.240 --> 29:52.240
before, it's kind of like a packaging format for, you know, you have a server and you want

29:52.240 --> 29:58.240
to install like Apache on it or something, and you tell Ansible, install Apache for me,

29:58.240 --> 30:03.240
and then you want to install the new thing, and then you kind of package this into a role.

30:03.240 --> 30:08.240
And at some point, I realized that everybody is writing the same roles, there's like, it's

30:08.240 --> 30:13.240
very difficult to like share and to reuse other people's stuff. It's definitely happening,

30:13.240 --> 30:20.240
but not on the scale that I was looking for, and so I was looking for alternatives. Yeah,

30:20.240 --> 30:28.240
so in the project so far, we've seen people like we have, for example, matrix servers,

30:28.240 --> 30:35.240
Synapse installs, we've seen multiple collectives look at the config and say, this works for

30:35.240 --> 30:41.240
me, I'm going to use this, and then changing the config in collaboration with other groups.

30:41.240 --> 30:46.240
So we're already seeing that people are able to make the changes that works for them without

30:46.240 --> 30:50.240
breaking other people's installs. And then when things need to be worked out, they speak to

30:50.240 --> 30:57.240
each other and things move along. And again, the compose standard really helps here in

30:57.240 --> 31:05.240
that it's quite flexible and helps us, people can move around each other inside the configuration,

31:05.240 --> 31:13.240
which will hopefully become clear on the next slide. Yes, great. So we're calling the app

31:13.240 --> 31:21.240
configuration a recipe, cooking inspired. And it's a good repository. Here you have git

31:21.240 --> 31:28.240
t, git t, so I don't know. And it's a bunch of config files. And as a collective, you come

31:28.240 --> 31:33.240
here and look and say, okay, this is the configuration which specifies, you know, how this

31:33.240 --> 31:40.240
thing should look like in a deployment. And kind of one of the magic source of this format

31:40.240 --> 31:47.240
is that if you've ever used, I think it's a Docker, I think it was a Docker compose

31:47.240 --> 31:52.240
command line client, you can kind of chain the compose files. So you can say like Docker

31:52.240 --> 32:01.240
compose op, compose.yaml minus f, compose.some other thing.yaml. And the system will internally

32:01.240 --> 32:08.240
merge all of these configurations together and then roll out the app, which I never had

32:08.240 --> 32:14.240
occasion to use until I realized that maybe somebody wants to use Postgres and maybe someone

32:14.240 --> 32:25.240
wants to use MariaDB. These simple choices for deployments, if it's not possible to kind

32:25.240 --> 32:32.240
of like make this easy to do between different groups, it would never work out. So very,

32:32.240 --> 32:39.240
very thankful to the people who wrote this standard. So you can see here, you can kind

32:39.240 --> 32:43.240
of, and it'll become clear when we talk about the command line client, you can kind of

32:43.240 --> 32:50.240
specify, okay, I want MariaDB and I want the SMTP config bundle all together, roll it out.

32:50.240 --> 32:54.240
And I don't want Postgres or I don't want this or I don't want that. And this allows

32:54.240 --> 32:59.240
people to just expand the config to suit their needs, document it, let people know this is

32:59.240 --> 33:03.240
a new feature. So it's quite nice. You can be just hosting some software and then somebody

33:03.240 --> 33:07.240
says, oh, great, open ID connect now works with this, just load this thing in. And you

33:07.240 --> 33:15.240
know, this is really helping us move forward and get things done. Yeah, at the moment,

33:15.240 --> 33:21.240
we have a command line client called Abra. And this is the kind of day-to-day interface

33:21.240 --> 33:26.240
for how you manage your cloud cloud install. So you have a server, you deploy stuff to

33:26.240 --> 33:32.240
a server, you're using Abra on the command line. And that was a real, that was a large

33:32.240 --> 33:38.240
decision for us at the time because we didn't have much money, we didn't know if we would

33:38.240 --> 33:43.240
be able to pull off a web front end. And again, as I mentioned before, we were trying to

33:43.240 --> 33:47.240
target specifically like, who is the public of this project? Are they people who know

33:47.240 --> 33:51.240
and are comfortable on the command line? Yes, okay, let's just go ahead with this and try

33:51.240 --> 33:58.240
to make it work. So we wrote in Bash the first one and I still completely recommend it,

33:58.240 --> 34:07.240
just unleash your inner Unix. It was great, it managed to get us to, you know, zero to

34:07.240 --> 34:14.240
hero in relatively short amount of time and have a system that was working. One of the

34:14.240 --> 34:20.240
kind of core ideas behind developing our own tools, we were very conscious that we might

34:20.240 --> 34:27.240
fail, won't be able to get it done. And we wanted to have that, the conflict commons would

34:27.240 --> 34:33.240
kind of live separately. So these would be kind of not interdependent in a way that if

34:33.240 --> 34:39.240
one broke, the other would break. So if you even today, if you just ignore that Abra

34:39.240 --> 34:44.240
exists, you can still drop into the command line, run a bunch of commands and roll out

34:44.240 --> 34:50.240
the app, which is great. And that's kind of how we originally conceived it with the Bash

34:50.240 --> 34:54.240
system, we're just running a bunch of commands. And we had kind of like laid it all out in

34:54.240 --> 35:00.240
a way that kind of said, okay, you can just push that out. So yeah, thanks to Kalex,

35:00.240 --> 35:07.240
a fellow worker who's great at Bash programming. We wouldn't have done it without them. Yes,

35:07.240 --> 35:12.240
so then we read, wrote and go, we actually managed to get some funding, which will come

35:12.240 --> 35:18.240
to you after, I guess they're not Bash programmers, if they read the source, they might have

35:18.240 --> 35:25.240
felt otherwise. But at that point, we were running into issues with the Bash implementation,

35:25.240 --> 35:32.240
which we felt quite proud about that we had like gone ahead and found the limits of the

35:32.240 --> 35:39.240
simplest possible thing that we could do. And the issues were it was difficult to install

35:39.240 --> 35:46.240
on multiple systems. It relied on a number of built in commands that were not always

35:46.240 --> 35:53.240
available on, you know, like a Fedora, Debian or whatever. So yeah, portability. We were

35:53.240 --> 36:00.240
struggling with we wanted to kind of develop other aspects of we like we wanted the tools

36:00.240 --> 36:05.240
to be able to speak to the conflict commons but not directly pairs each other. And that

36:05.240 --> 36:11.240
ended up being a kind of like JSON catalog, but then pirating data formats in Bash is

36:11.240 --> 36:18.240
difficult. So we were we're kind of pulling our hair out on that one. And then concurrency,

36:18.240 --> 36:24.240
we were struggling to manage horizontal scaling. So if you have worked with 18 groups, they

36:24.240 --> 36:30.240
want to have their own VPSes. If you have 10 servers, you know, the tool has to like

36:30.240 --> 36:35.240
fire a request to each 10 of them or whatever. And then if it's going through each one at

36:35.240 --> 36:43.240
the time, you have to wait. And as a result of kind of scaling up and using this absolutely

36:43.240 --> 36:50.240
pre alpha software and autonomic for production purposes, we reached the limits of the software.

36:50.240 --> 36:55.240
So we ended up rewriting it and go somebody knew go in autonomic at the time. That's the

36:55.240 --> 37:03.240
reason. But also, we saw that it was really, you know, we could get this concurrency issue

37:03.240 --> 37:08.240
sorted and the portability. So go kind of gives you a language level feature that it's

37:08.240 --> 37:14.240
like quite easy to say like fire across these 10 things immediately. And you can build

37:14.240 --> 37:18.240
a binary so you can just fire them out. So people just get like a binary on the system

37:18.240 --> 37:25.240
and the stuff is all baked into it. So the new problem with this is that it actually

37:25.240 --> 37:30.240
works. It does what it says and people are starting to use it. So we're now into this

37:30.240 --> 37:37.240
kind of maintenance cycle. It's kind of approach. We've done the public beta. So people are

37:37.240 --> 37:43.240
using it and starting to rely on it. And we've seen people hacking on it and submitting

37:43.240 --> 37:52.240
pull requests and checking it out. And it's all good. Yeah, so in essence, ABRA is a

37:52.240 --> 37:59.240
Docker swarm client. So no, we don't run Kubernetes. We run Docker swarm and no, it's not dead.

37:59.240 --> 38:06.240
Docker swarm is a technology that is still alive. We're kind of we have like a strange

38:06.240 --> 38:14.240
parasitical relationship with like some installs, like some banks have like a swarm install

38:14.240 --> 38:19.240
of like, you know, 10,000 nodes or something. And the current owner, I believe it's Marantis

38:19.240 --> 38:25.240
or something that's been in exchange of who owns it or who I can't remember. But we're

38:25.240 --> 38:31.240
it's still being maintained and we're happy to see that it is being maintained because

38:31.240 --> 38:41.240
we identify that swarm mode in Docker is kind of the appropriate feature set that we need

38:41.240 --> 38:49.240
without having to deal with going into learning how to, you know, roll out a large system

38:49.240 --> 38:54.240
which is built for like large scale. Our, you know, and again, this is like what was

38:54.240 --> 38:59.240
autonomic doing at the time was like rolling out single servers deploying a few apps,

38:59.240 --> 39:07.240
no greater than like 10 to 30, 50, 100 users or whatever. And swarm mode provides you with

39:07.240 --> 39:11.240
the ability to kind of roll out the app. And if it fails, it'll roll it back for you.

39:11.240 --> 39:16.240
And we can bake that into our config. So we were kind of getting the stability guarantees

39:16.240 --> 39:21.240
that we needed. And not a lot of groups were demanding, you know, when they had like a

39:21.240 --> 39:26.240
media wiki installed, they weren't saying there must be 99% uptime in this contract or

39:26.240 --> 39:32.240
not. But we still wanted to push that to the limit, like a high quality, stable service

39:32.240 --> 39:41.240
when we're rolling stuff out. This should be, yeah. And then, yeah, the swarm mode just

39:41.240 --> 39:49.240
covers that for us, the runtime, the Canadian runtime. So yeah, this is a kind of like the

39:49.240 --> 39:56.240
architecture, let's say. So on the left, you will install Abra, for example, on your local

39:56.240 --> 40:03.240
workstation, the command line tool. And then you'll via SSH kind of tell Abra to manage

40:03.240 --> 40:08.240
this server. So it'll read the SSH config and it'll connect to the server and say, okay,

40:08.240 --> 40:12.240
recognize this server. I see there's a Docker demon running on this and it's got swarm mode

40:12.240 --> 40:18.240
enabled. Cool. And then it can, you know, you can do this horizontal scaling where you can

40:18.240 --> 40:27.240
install servers. So you can load multiple servers into Abra. And then you can be sharing the

40:27.240 --> 40:35.240
Abra state between multiple people. So in a co-op of 13 people, you know, each one who

40:35.240 --> 40:41.240
runs Abra app, so whatever to list the apps and the servers, we'll see the same state

40:41.240 --> 40:49.240
come out. And we can go into that a bit later. So yeah, it's built for basically collaboration

40:49.240 --> 40:55.240
in the organization that you're in. And then the other mode is you install Abra directly

40:55.240 --> 41:01.240
on the server and it stores the state on the server, which could be useful if you're,

41:01.240 --> 41:07.240
yeah, for specific scenarios, this was requested. Yeah, some people run this, I don't

41:07.240 --> 41:15.240
know. Yeah, and then the final points. Moving on, collective infrastructure, yeah, docs,

41:15.240 --> 41:23.240
git hosting, recipes.coop, cloud.tech, you can see the list of all the apps we have. We

41:23.240 --> 41:30.240
have an open collective, which is the fiscal host is autonomic. Bank account in the UK.

41:30.240 --> 41:35.240
And that's been nice because we've been able to, once we got the funding, we were able

41:35.240 --> 41:41.240
to tell people, if you work on this, we can pay you just immediately. Anything you do,

41:41.240 --> 41:46.240
you'll get paid. And that's great because we know there's a lot of unpaid labor going

41:46.240 --> 41:50.240
on in open source world. So we didn't want to be a project that said, you know, contribute

41:50.240 --> 41:54.240
to our comments and get nothing back. No, we could actually pay, you know, so we set

41:54.240 --> 41:58.240
like an hourly wage there and we said, this is how much money we have and away you go.

41:58.240 --> 42:06.240
That worked out great, I would say. And the server firm, server's co-op, so I wanted to

42:06.240 --> 42:12.240
plug this other project that's, you can go to the website, servers.coop. Yeah, we've

42:12.240 --> 42:20.240
been working with a group who've been developing software called Capsule, Siberia, great

42:20.240 --> 42:25.240
hackers, and they're trying to develop a system. Well, they have developed a system,

42:25.240 --> 42:33.240
which is basically a server provider infrastructure like Hetsnure, for example. So VPSs, you know,

42:33.240 --> 42:38.240
I need a server to roll one out, I need another server to roll one out. And then we, and a

42:38.240 --> 42:43.240
couple of other people, myself included, were thinking, okay, this is great because a lot

42:43.240 --> 42:50.240
of collectors are centralizing on Hetsnure VPSs, right? And if Hetsnure rolls up the

42:50.240 --> 42:54.240
price or, you know, we've already seen this with the increase in cost in IPv4 addresses

42:54.240 --> 43:00.240
and the 10% increase this year, it's getting more costly to run on Hetsnure, but it's

43:00.240 --> 43:05.240
always been super cheap, and that's been super accessible. But it could change, so what do

43:05.240 --> 43:10.240
we do? We need to build up this aspect of our stack, so we kind of like expand the

43:10.240 --> 43:17.240
cooperative layer down to the servers, and that is the idea behind server's co-op. And

43:17.240 --> 43:24.240
ABRA already supports an integration, so you can do, like, server-new, and if you've got

43:24.240 --> 43:30.240
a capsule running on your server, it'll spin up a VM. So we were already trying to, like,

43:30.240 --> 43:36.240
you know, just take a turn into cooperatively managed infrastructure and build those

43:36.240 --> 43:41.240
integrations from the stack. Whether or not they're working that great is for me to be

43:41.240 --> 43:49.240
seen. Yes, so European Cultural Foundation gave us upwards of 30 grand in funding last

43:49.240 --> 43:55.240
year and the year before, in the context of the Culture of Solidarity Fund. That was

43:55.240 --> 44:00.240
amazing, thanks to them. They were really great, and I would recommend applying to them.

44:00.240 --> 44:05.240
They supported us the whole way through. It was, yeah, just fantastic. We wrote our

44:05.240 --> 44:14.240
application and sent it into them, so pretty happy with that one. Great. Nearly done. Yeah,

44:14.240 --> 44:19.240
I want to just jump, so this isn't vaporware. Again, I want to plug, like, I just find it

44:19.240 --> 44:23.240
so important to explain that people are actually using this, and this isn't just, like, some

44:23.240 --> 44:27.240
idea in our heads, and we think it's cool. It's like, people are actually running, you

44:27.240 --> 44:32.240
know, they rely on some of the things that have been deployed. So Lonely Duck Space is

44:32.240 --> 44:40.240
a project which is about, like, 13 apps, I think, on a server somewhere, which was

44:40.240 --> 44:45.240
initiated by an artist collective called Ron Grupa, which is, like, an Indonesian-based

44:45.240 --> 44:54.240
collective in the context of documentary. And they wanted to kind of approach a group

44:54.240 --> 44:59.240
that connected with their values. At some point they were, so they were invited to

44:59.240 --> 45:04.240
document it, to do the work, and they thought, okay, we're all the way over here.

45:04.240 --> 45:08.240
In Indonesia, we need to work with people who are based in Europe, so we're going to

45:08.240 --> 45:12.240
need digital tools, but we don't want to be immediately going on the Google drives of

45:12.240 --> 45:17.240
the world. So how do we build up, you know, extend our ways of working and our values

45:17.240 --> 45:23.240
into the digital realm? So then they came looking for collectors and co-ops, a friend

45:23.240 --> 45:31.240
who was through to them. Yeah, and here's just some photos of us just engaging in this

45:31.240 --> 45:39.240
massively multiplayer shared infrastructure project. So it was really great. People from

45:39.240 --> 45:44.240
my perspective understood what Core of Cloud was and the mission behind it, and felt

45:44.240 --> 45:49.240
invited to kind of look at the technology and what we were doing and comment on that

45:49.240 --> 45:54.240
and give this critique. You know, we're often in a space where people want to talk about

45:54.240 --> 45:59.240
digital tools, but the first thing they say is, oh, I don't know anything about technology,

45:59.240 --> 46:04.240
which is kind of like a hallmark. You have to excuse yourself or something. But we got

46:04.240 --> 46:11.240
past that in working with this group of people that may not find themselves technical, but

46:11.240 --> 46:17.240
as we moved on, again, Core of Cloud allowed us to just kind of deploy the tech and just

46:17.240 --> 46:23.240
like, just forget about it and then go on with the support work. And we ended up with,

46:23.240 --> 46:28.240
like the last great thing I saw from this project was the people involved in using the

46:28.240 --> 46:34.240
tools were publishing videos about how to use the tools in the stack. So they were like

46:34.240 --> 46:40.240
in the Matrix Chat and on the PeerTube publishing. Here's how you use PeerTube. Amazing. Great

46:40.240 --> 46:46.240
educational practice. Totally check it out. TV.Lumbung.Space is the worst I've done.

46:46.240 --> 46:52.240
Yeah. This was another project we met kind of in the context of Documenta. So this is

46:52.240 --> 46:58.240
a comic group. Aircraft is a comic illustrator's union, which is bootstrapping at the moment.

46:58.240 --> 47:05.240
And they felt, you know, they saw Lumbung.Space and they were like, this looks cool. And I

47:05.240 --> 47:10.240
like the idea of what is going, you know, I understand what is happening here. There

47:10.240 --> 47:16.240
are two groups cooperating here, this kind of like cultural based initiative and this

47:16.240 --> 47:22.240
technology collective. And, you know, I can see the Cloud Cloud website and this looks

47:22.240 --> 47:27.240
like we want to check this out. So we kind of got over that fear and anxiety and moved

47:27.240 --> 47:32.240
through the money exchange and, you know, let's work together. It was quite smooth.

47:32.240 --> 47:36.240
So I would say Cloud Cloud is then helping us just again put these things to rest like

47:36.240 --> 47:41.240
this is the project we're based on, you know, when we work, when we deploy your infrastructure,

47:41.240 --> 47:46.240
it will be contributing to the commons, copy left, democratically managed, you know, you

47:46.240 --> 47:55.240
kind of just get over the hump. And yeah, Kotec is a new co-op which is set in Poland

47:55.240 --> 48:00.240
and that was a major boost. So they've deployed a bunch of services. Some members are in the

48:00.240 --> 48:09.240
room. Super nice. Yeah, it's a software stack which is in its, you know, initiated and developed

48:09.240 --> 48:15.240
by cooperatives. So it should suit other cooperatives. Of course, if you want to start a new technology

48:15.240 --> 48:22.240
cooperative, how do you start? It's overwhelming. But now you've got this off the shelf project

48:22.240 --> 48:28.240
and it's like, get going. And once you enter it, you just see all the other collectives

48:28.240 --> 48:34.240
and you're like, great. We can learn. We can share. And again, it expands beyond the technical

48:34.240 --> 48:38.240
so we have the infrastructure for payment and bank accounts and all this stuff. So people

48:38.240 --> 48:46.240
can really get moving fast, I think, is good. And we want to expand the, you know, we want

48:46.240 --> 48:52.240
people to start technology cooperatives, start technology cooperatives. Yes, Enterprise Matrix

48:52.240 --> 48:59.240
21 collectives. Somebody counted them. Maybe it was me at some point. But there's a lot

48:59.240 --> 49:06.240
of groups involved in this. You can, if you go on the website, it's in the blog post,

49:06.240 --> 49:11.240
a list of them. We've got 160 plus recipes. This is a lot of open source apps. You can

49:11.240 --> 49:19.240
probably find what you need in there. And yeah, we're running 146 apps. I think I ran

49:19.240 --> 49:25.240
Abra app LS at some points. So I don't know because heavily invested in this. And there

49:25.240 --> 49:33.240
are other collectives which are running the stack. Yeah, and maybe just kind of coming

49:33.240 --> 49:40.240
to the end. It's been a lot of details. I'm even overwhelmed myself. The last few slides,

49:40.240 --> 49:50.240
kind of philosophy take, you know, we wanted to be another project in the ecosystem and

49:50.240 --> 49:59.240
not just become the project in relation to decentralization, let's say. We really posit

49:59.240 --> 50:06.240
ourselves in, you know, against kind of this like big tech discourse and what's happening.

50:06.240 --> 50:12.240
And we thought we could contribute to, you know, internet and digital infrastructure

50:12.240 --> 50:19.240
decentralization by proposing Call of Cloud in its form. And we're only one project. So

50:19.240 --> 50:25.240
I thought it would be good to plug some other great projects which I just find super inspiring.

50:25.240 --> 50:31.240
I think, like, I would say Unohost is like maybe one of the gold standards of community

50:31.240 --> 50:37.240
organized infrastructure hosting. It has a different kind of set of priorities and goals.

50:37.240 --> 50:43.240
You know, everyone can be a system administrator. It's kind of their goal. Like, you know, let's

50:43.240 --> 50:48.240
make information available to people. Anyone can do this, get going. Brilliant project.

50:48.240 --> 50:54.240
Whereas we're going for, you know, specific groups, co-ops. You're already in the game.

50:54.240 --> 50:59.240
How can we make it easier to keep going? So it's a bit of the different layers. But absolutely

50:59.240 --> 51:05.240
recommend Unohost. Nubos based in Brussels. Check them out. Chateau's great network.

51:05.240 --> 51:10.240
Cotech is a network of cooperatives based in the U.K. I think it's like 35 cooperatives.

51:10.240 --> 51:17.240
Check them out if you're looking for a job, get stuck in. Social co-op, trying to build

51:17.240 --> 51:24.240
cooperatively managed, master on instances, local IT, great collective already based in,

51:24.240 --> 51:29.240
yeah, being involved in co-op cloud at the moment. Small technology foundation. Always

51:29.240 --> 51:36.240
find inspiring. Check that out. Small tech. Just plug in them. Yeah. Oh, five minutes.

51:36.240 --> 51:43.240
Cool. The roadmap is, yeah, as I said, building the federation. So now is a great time to

51:43.240 --> 51:50.240
join. You know, as you're, you know, again, as an individual, a collective co-op, please

51:50.240 --> 51:57.240
get involved if you want to. We're trying to find more money, of course. One of the goals

51:57.240 --> 52:04.240
of the federation is to kind of achieve financial sustainability. So the co-ops that join or

52:04.240 --> 52:10.240
the groups that join the project will be, you know, we're going to have to decide, all right,

52:10.240 --> 52:17.240
how do we fund development of the tool? And can we pay for hours around finance, admin,

52:17.240 --> 52:25.240
cash, just, you know, all this end to end stuff. Yeah, Cadabra is a kind of new effort to kind

52:25.240 --> 52:30.240
of have a server side component, which is, and this is the thing that Cloudron did amazingly

52:30.240 --> 52:35.240
well, which is just auto updating the apps. So we're trying to replicate that in terms

52:35.240 --> 52:41.240
of the server side component, which understands, you know, oh, someone who takes care of that

52:41.240 --> 52:47.240
recipe has uploaded a new version, I'm going to roll it out. And yeah, web interface, I

52:47.240 --> 52:54.240
forgot to add maybe, because it's still under discussion if we need that or not. Yes, again

52:54.240 --> 53:00.240
to the end, I have, I could do a demo, a chaos demo.

53:00.240 --> 53:16.240
Yeah, okay, maybe I'll just do a chaos demo. So I wanted to like run. Yes, just show you

53:16.240 --> 53:24.240
the command line client. So again, to contextualize this is the tool that people who maintain

53:24.240 --> 53:31.240
the service will be running on a daily basis. So it's supposed to make the job easy. And

53:31.240 --> 53:40.240
I won't go through all of it at the moment. But, you know, it's, it's, you know, we try

53:40.240 --> 53:44.240
to take effort to like explain the concepts that are involved in the project and what

53:44.240 --> 53:55.240
you can do. You know, you can list all the recipes that are available from the command

53:55.240 --> 54:05.240
line, for example. And yeah, you can also do operations on recipes here. So you can like

54:05.240 --> 54:13.240
attempt to upgrade. Oh, I probably don't have internet. Yeah, right. Okay, well, anyway,

54:13.240 --> 54:18.240
you can kind of like do the maintenance commands on the spot. So again, you're on your local

54:18.240 --> 54:22.240
workstation, you realize that there's a new version of next cloud is coming out. Okay,

54:22.240 --> 54:27.240
let's get that upgraded. And then you can run the commands here. And I'll basically

54:27.240 --> 54:35.240
operate on this directory of recipes, where you can see a selection of the apps. And then,

54:35.240 --> 54:44.240
you know, this is just the what I showed earlier, the recipe repository. So the, this is the

54:44.240 --> 54:51.240
configuration that specifies how to deploy this app. Yeah, and there's some other details

54:51.240 --> 54:56.240
that I didn't really go into. But basically, one of the nice things that we've wired up

54:56.240 --> 55:03.240
is that if you deploy this app called traffic that when you roll out next cloud, it automatically

55:03.240 --> 55:08.240
configures the lesson crypt stuff. So you just don't have to deal with this HTTPS issue.

55:08.240 --> 55:17.240
It's already in the config, you just say, give me a thing. Yeah, I don't know, was there

55:17.240 --> 55:22.240
much more? Oh, yeah, I guess. Yeah, and then there's just kind of this like command and

55:22.240 --> 55:28.240
control interface where you can see like, okay, what apps have I got on what servers and,

55:28.240 --> 55:35.240
you know, what do I need to do and you can kind of like, you know, filter it by server

55:35.240 --> 55:43.240
or whatever. I won't type it out now. But yeah, maybe I'll call it a day. Thank you for

55:43.240 --> 55:45.240
listening to me talk for so long.

55:45.240 --> 55:59.240
Thank you.
