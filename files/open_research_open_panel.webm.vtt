WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.160
Okay, so basically we had this extra slot of time in our physical session.

00:14.160 --> 00:22.640
Actually, we want to use that time to engage discussion with you, the audience, about this

00:22.640 --> 00:27.760
open research track here at FOSDEM.

00:27.760 --> 00:33.040
We are opening the stage for basically questions and discussions.

00:33.040 --> 00:43.800
Just wanted to very briefly say a few words about how we ended up creating this space.

00:43.800 --> 00:51.960
So basically, we've been with a few colleagues at Sains-Paul-Paris, for instance, doing a

00:51.960 --> 00:59.800
few conferences here at FOSDEM in other dev rooms, using this FOSDEM conference as a venue

00:59.800 --> 01:05.080
to actually talk about technical realizations we were doing in the lab.

01:05.080 --> 01:11.800
And it was not so, it was a very good opportunity for us because it's not easy to do a scientific

01:11.800 --> 01:18.320
publication about technical things, more specifically into the social sciences.

01:18.320 --> 01:25.600
So after a few years of doing that, we thought that actually we could try to go a step further

01:25.600 --> 01:34.480
on this by organizing this track which is definitely about open source software and research.

01:34.480 --> 01:40.440
And so we had, as you've seen, we understand research with a very broad way.

01:40.440 --> 01:47.360
Any kind of inquiry is, we think, interesting to discuss because the chair, a journalist

01:47.360 --> 01:53.680
investigator, or we had an open factor, for instance, or a social scientist, or a natural

01:53.680 --> 02:01.240
science scientist, all share kind of the same engagement with data and about inquiry.

02:01.240 --> 02:08.720
So we created this room four years ago, actually at the time we were merged with another initiative

02:08.720 --> 02:18.760
from two people from neuroscience, and it was nice also to have these different disciplines.

02:18.760 --> 02:25.680
Of course, then the COVID came, so we succeeded into keeping the room online.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.880
And now, so we have folks, a crew of five, six people.

02:30.880 --> 02:40.080
We have two people who are online, Yo Yehudi and Celia Gruzon Daniel, who will actually

02:40.080 --> 02:48.680
monitor from their home the online session, which will start in 20 minutes.

02:48.680 --> 02:54.520
And basically we are a bunch of people working in academia, or not, or in the Open Knowledge

02:54.520 --> 03:00.000
Foundation, and I am no more in academia myself.

03:00.000 --> 03:07.920
And so the first thing I would like to say is like volunteers to help us out organizing

03:07.920 --> 03:11.920
this space are more than welcome.

03:11.920 --> 03:18.600
Basically the work of this starts in the autumn where we submit a proposal to force them to

03:18.600 --> 03:20.320
organize this room again.

03:20.320 --> 03:24.080
So each year we do that, we wait for the answer, and once we have it, we have to do a call

03:24.080 --> 03:31.320
of proposal for something very, very classic about organizing a conference.

03:31.320 --> 03:37.200
So reviewing papers, actually getting the papers in, so we actually contact people for

03:37.200 --> 03:41.440
asking them to come to our conference.

03:41.440 --> 03:46.120
And then as you've seen what we've been doing today, mining the door, putting signs on people

03:46.120 --> 03:50.560
and that kind of stuff, which is fun.

03:50.560 --> 03:56.440
And yeah, so I will finish with that, and maybe some other people won't say other things.

03:56.440 --> 04:07.200
I will finish this with one thing, it's important for us to try to augment diversity of our group.

04:07.200 --> 04:13.680
Gender but also disciplines, we like to open up as much more, well as much discipline as

04:13.680 --> 04:14.680
we can.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.680
So yeah.

04:15.680 --> 04:24.560
Sorry, less diversity, so there is a question about, yes, yes, also less French people.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.960
We tried that, we succeeded a little bit, but not that much.

04:27.960 --> 04:28.960
So yes, please.

04:28.960 --> 04:29.960
Matthew.

04:29.960 --> 04:37.960
Yeah, I just wanted to say a few things, but basically the reason we need you is also

04:37.960 --> 04:41.880
to increase this diversity in the papers submitted.

04:41.880 --> 04:46.920
Because for instance, if you look at the gender balance, the committee is basically gender

04:46.920 --> 04:53.240
balanced, but the submissions are completely dominated by males.

04:53.240 --> 05:02.640
And also the deaf room in the beginning had one leg firmly into the hard sciences, but

05:02.640 --> 05:07.000
then we've kind of drifted towards the social sciences, and it's not just us, it's also

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
the demand.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.640
So, you know, we try to promote something, but it's kind of an equity balance game to

05:14.640 --> 05:20.560
try to have this variety in the proposals in the first place, because of course we cannot,

05:20.560 --> 05:24.840
if we don't have any proposition, for instance in hard science, we are not going to have

05:24.840 --> 05:25.840
any.

05:25.840 --> 05:32.480
So the audience, which is like, when if you submit papers or if you come into the committee

05:32.480 --> 05:37.880
and then become a bridge to contact other people to submit papers, that's how we can

05:37.880 --> 05:42.200
kind of ensure that it remains diverse.

05:42.200 --> 05:49.120
It's not a lot of work to participate, also because we are many and we are probably going

05:49.120 --> 05:55.600
to get even more people, and it's not a problem to be many, because like the real job beyond

05:55.600 --> 06:01.320
managing the day is, as you said, to contact the people and then to review, but mostly

06:01.320 --> 06:02.560
to contact them.

06:02.560 --> 06:08.880
So please come in and join us about that, but we could also have this discussion about

06:08.880 --> 06:13.400
what the scope of that should be, because I think that the figure of the tool maker

06:13.400 --> 06:17.400
was kind of at the center of what we had in mind.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.800
But as we see, it's not just about tools, it can also be about infrastructure in ways

06:21.800 --> 06:26.560
that is not tool, like institutions, you know, I don't know, I'm thinking of the Journal

06:26.560 --> 06:30.920
of Open Source Software that we had a few years back, think that infrastructure is not

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
just tools.

06:31.920 --> 06:36.880
But now it's clear, it's not just the tool makers, let's say the infrastructure maker,

06:36.880 --> 06:42.120
and what could it be, like, common and shape the profile of their room with us.

06:42.120 --> 06:51.120
Can I, just to emphasize what you said, can I just share my little experience from this?

06:51.120 --> 06:52.120
Go ahead, take the mic.

06:52.120 --> 07:04.280
But just to emphasize what Mathieu said, this was my first time I forced them and as I told

07:04.280 --> 07:12.440
you, I'm not a coder, so I was pretty scared about what I was going to say and share, etc.

07:12.440 --> 07:21.440
So please do it, because why I came here was to share knowledge, of course, but to retrieve

07:21.440 --> 07:28.520
some different experience from what I do every day and who the people are with whom I work

07:28.520 --> 07:29.520
every day.

07:29.520 --> 07:34.320
So thank you for this, and please submit papers.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.320
Yeah.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.320
Do you want the mic?

07:37.320 --> 07:38.320
Yeah, yeah.

07:38.320 --> 07:51.480
I think one challenge for the diversity aside of many other factors is there's also the

07:51.480 --> 07:55.480
implicit assumption that there's sort of a good way to use open source software.

07:55.480 --> 08:01.920
There were some talks, for example, that kind of, not in a bad way, but sort of said that

08:01.920 --> 08:07.280
R is kind of tricky because, like, I think it's sort of more dead mainstream and I understand

08:07.280 --> 08:12.880
that when I want to develop software, I would use it, but in statistics I use a lot of R,

08:12.880 --> 08:18.880
but I also use a lot of Excel for help, and then people are like, oh no, that's a bad

08:18.880 --> 08:23.880
tool, but a lot of people in their practice, particularly if they're not developers, would

08:23.880 --> 08:29.080
combine a lot of different tools, and I think if they get the vibe that, hey, we also use

08:29.080 --> 08:35.560
Excel, it's sort of a bad thing for their practice and people look at it strangely,

08:35.560 --> 08:39.920
or even if it's like LibreOffice, which at least is open source, but it's like not the

08:39.920 --> 08:48.280
death way, and I guess that vibe that people catch that would make also a lot of people

08:48.280 --> 08:53.960
that would be very interesting for this community to also see how, like, it's done in the real

08:53.960 --> 09:02.120
world in a very messy way, very often, makes them not like that, and if we could get to

09:02.120 --> 09:07.640
a place where this would be legit and people would be curious and interested in those

09:07.640 --> 09:15.920
non-perfect, chaotic, and not 100% open source ways, I think that would increase their versatility.

09:15.920 --> 09:21.080
So just for the stream, the idea that a challenge to diversity could be that there are good ways

09:21.080 --> 09:27.480
and bad ways to do open source, and I always say that I forgot the last part of your speech.

09:27.480 --> 09:32.240
The Excel LibreOffice part is important.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
He's going to come back later.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.240
I'm sorry.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.240
I'm so tired.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
It was for the stream.

09:36.240 --> 09:42.520
Yeah, that's what the point was, but I mean, you were very right that it's about us to

09:42.520 --> 09:43.520
cultivate that.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.840
Yeah, it comes back to me now.

09:45.840 --> 09:50.760
It's really important to show how it's being done in the real world.

09:50.760 --> 09:55.160
That's something that I think we all appreciate very much about the first-dimensional.

09:55.160 --> 09:59.400
You don't see some people talking from a distance about how it's supposed to be.

09:59.400 --> 10:04.640
You have real people who are from actually doing stuff, which also means that sometimes

10:04.640 --> 10:08.080
they are not really good at communicating, and that's something that I really appreciate

10:08.080 --> 10:10.840
because you hear the voices.

10:10.840 --> 10:16.160
I think for them it's somehow a safe space for people who are not primarily good at communicating

10:16.160 --> 10:21.000
contrary to academics, for instance, but who are really doing the stuff, and we can

10:21.000 --> 10:27.720
hear them, and we can identify to them and realize that anyone can get involved in open

10:27.720 --> 10:29.840
science and open source design.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.800
We want very much to keep cultivating that.

10:31.800 --> 10:36.480
That's why also we try to have a blend of people showing off the tools they've made,

10:36.480 --> 10:38.520
but also people having a different kind of talk.

10:38.520 --> 10:54.560
I don't know what the right balance is, but we want to preserve this voice.

10:54.560 --> 11:09.240
I was a researcher at some point during my PhD, I was part of a training workshop led

11:09.240 --> 11:16.240
by PhD students involved in training ourselves with best practices in mind and also to have

11:16.240 --> 11:22.600
a grassroots initiative, which I think is kind of like a good example of what worked

11:22.600 --> 11:31.000
in a particular field is this kind of like stories of what worked in a particular domain

11:31.000 --> 11:35.640
with that be a thing interesting for this dev room.

11:35.640 --> 11:40.160
So our stories that worked in a particular domain interesting for the dev room.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.480
Well for me I think it totally is.

11:43.480 --> 11:48.840
So the answer is yes, and I think we've somehow done that, but sometimes what it looks once

11:48.840 --> 11:54.120
it's in the slides and here looks different, but that is very much the case.

11:54.120 --> 12:00.360
I think we do not have a clear typology of the kind of talks we accept.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.360
One very clear kind is the tool talk.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.920
I've done something, I show you that to you.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.320
Another kind would be experiment feedback.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.320
So I'm not going to show my tool, but for instance I have engaged with that open source

12:13.320 --> 12:18.080
stack and I've met issues, I'm going to talk about that.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.080
This is a little bit of that kind somehow.

12:20.080 --> 12:29.080
Do you think it will be pertinent to add more track dedicated to very short talks like lightning

12:29.080 --> 12:34.400
talks, but dedicated to more?

12:34.400 --> 12:35.400
Repeat the question.

12:35.400 --> 12:42.800
So a question like would it be a good idea to organize very short lightning talks about

12:42.800 --> 12:44.680
open research?

12:44.680 --> 12:49.200
So actually we try to do that a little bit, like the three last talks were lightnings,

12:49.200 --> 12:54.800
okay, lightnings 15 minutes, so it's not, but I think it's, yeah.

12:54.800 --> 12:59.120
So we try, actually so the format lightning or not depends on what, on the time we have

12:59.120 --> 13:02.120
and what the speaker wants.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.120
So it basically is a tool.

13:04.120 --> 13:09.760
If you don't know how it works, people propose if they want a lightning talk or a normal talk,

13:09.760 --> 13:13.720
and then so we can also ask them to expand or reduce.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.600
If we think it fits better, so we try to negotiate.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.440
But it's kind of unpredictable how many lightning talks we're going to have.

13:20.440 --> 13:25.440
So the proposals decide if there's enough for a track or not.

13:25.440 --> 13:30.000
From the two last questions, there is one thing that's very important that's emerging.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
So the form, the form of things should be in question.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.800
And there is a sort of standardization associated with a conference.

13:42.800 --> 13:50.440
And as we receive talk, we perceive diversity even in the form and our experiences, tools

13:50.440 --> 13:55.360
or maybe talk, we do have a classifications.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.840
But seeing things here, it's sort of standardized.

13:59.840 --> 14:05.360
And maybe we should work together, so you're in this with us, on the form of things, on

14:05.360 --> 14:08.640
maybe other forms of presentations.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.800
We're not that constrained by the first them.

14:10.800 --> 14:17.960
So that's one way we could work forward into.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.400
But there are many things we could do.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.400
And I am tired.

14:21.400 --> 14:40.880
I do have a remark, I am part of the geospatial community, and on the two sides of the space.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.880
And we have the same problems.

14:41.880 --> 14:47.880
We have lots of developers who want to speak of their new things and the new stuff they

14:47.880 --> 14:54.880
want to do, but we have a problem to have users who speak of old things, how they use

14:54.880 --> 15:06.880
a tool and get new spaces and it's very difficult, and it's pretty hard to keep in touch with

15:06.880 --> 15:07.880
it.

15:07.880 --> 15:18.880
So I have a colleague, I asked her to come and present her tool, and she said, I don't

15:18.880 --> 15:19.880
fit.

15:19.880 --> 15:32.880
I'm a developer, it's not the kind of meeting for me, so maybe we can speak a little bit

15:32.880 --> 15:43.280
and see if it's very open to everyone.

15:43.280 --> 15:50.320
So the comment was that Nicola says that in the geospatial, they have this issue of having

15:50.320 --> 15:54.240
users come because they don't feel welcome or they don't feel like they fit.

15:54.240 --> 15:58.680
So I want to give the mic to Maya, because Maya was first, before she got in the community

15:58.680 --> 16:06.000
for the room, she was presenting a talk here two years ago, I think, 2020, as a user.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.120
So now you're in.

16:08.120 --> 16:12.200
So what would you give as an advice to those guys?

16:12.200 --> 16:16.000
Don't be scared, they're really nice.

16:16.000 --> 16:23.880
I understand your colleague perfectly, especially coming from academia, which is also my case.

16:23.880 --> 16:33.720
Maya is extremely segmented or taught to fear each other deeply, and so it can be really

16:33.720 --> 16:38.240
scary to push those boundaries a little bit.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.080
It can also be very rewarding.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.320
So you said she did come in 2020, or she didn't come?

16:44.320 --> 16:45.320
Okay.

16:45.320 --> 16:57.880
Okay, so despite trying, there was no success yet.

16:57.880 --> 17:04.000
Maybe if you show them this replay, it will change everything.

17:04.000 --> 17:12.920
I've got a question for you, which is, so one of our ideas, our objective, this was also

17:12.920 --> 17:17.280
to bring folks from academia here at the first day, so that they can actually benefit from

17:17.280 --> 17:19.600
the other conference and all the day rooms.

17:19.600 --> 17:25.360
So here's my questions, like, do you consider seeing talks in other day rooms and this one

17:25.360 --> 17:27.000
here, yourselves?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.200
Can you raise your hand if you do?

17:29.200 --> 17:30.200
Yeah.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.200
It's good?

17:31.200 --> 17:32.200
Yes.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.200
Yeah.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.200
Yeah, it's difficult to see.

17:35.200 --> 17:48.840
All the talks that we want to see, even though the offer is large.

17:48.840 --> 17:54.560
But on conversely, who is here now, but who didn't come to the FOSDEM specifically for

17:54.560 --> 17:55.560
that?

17:55.560 --> 17:56.560
Okay.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.560
Raise your hands.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.560
So it works also the other way around.

17:59.560 --> 18:00.560
Good.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.560
Thank you.

18:01.560 --> 18:06.560
Is it time?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.040
No, not yet.

18:08.040 --> 18:13.800
So we still have 10 minutes, and then we'll actually watch the stream here, if you want

18:13.800 --> 18:14.800
to stay.

18:14.800 --> 18:15.800
Quick question.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.560
What is the acceptance rate here?

18:19.560 --> 18:20.560
That's a very good question.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.880
So the question is, what is the acceptance rate?

18:23.880 --> 18:25.040
I don't know.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.800
We haven't calculated it, but I think...

18:26.800 --> 18:39.120
I would say that there is a part of the papers that are not good, I mean, they're out of focus

18:39.120 --> 18:41.480
for the day room.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.840
And what we can do, actually, we can re-route a paper to other day rooms, so it doesn't

18:44.840 --> 18:45.840
matter much.

18:45.840 --> 18:50.600
But also some people just submit to multiple day rooms for the same speech, right?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.000
And it's okay, right?

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
The boundaries are not super open, but there are kind of buggy proposals.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.560
What we would consider not acceptable would be, is that something that is clearly for

19:00.560 --> 19:03.360
someone else, and we don't know why it's been submitted here, or something that has just

19:03.360 --> 19:04.360
a title?

19:04.360 --> 19:08.160
When that happens, we would kind of send an email, sometimes we don't even have an answer,

19:08.160 --> 19:09.880
we don't know what happens.

19:09.880 --> 19:17.320
So if you remove those, the ones that we actually refuse, I think is like one-third, one-quarter

19:17.320 --> 19:19.480
maybe, with not too much.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.480
So we are always...

19:20.480 --> 19:22.080
It's been always working for us.

19:22.080 --> 19:27.760
We need to have enough to fill the day if we want to have a full day, but not too much

19:27.760 --> 19:29.880
that we have to refuse a lot of good talks.

19:29.880 --> 19:35.440
But to be honest, we've been refusing good talks every year, just because there's not

19:35.440 --> 19:38.200
enough room.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.680
So basically, we decide about the balance when it's the case.

19:41.680 --> 19:47.600
So when we have too many or not enough tool talks, we will try to adjust this way.

19:47.600 --> 19:54.280
I can remember that one kind of talks that we tend to reject are talks about a tool that

19:54.280 --> 20:00.280
have been developed somewhere in research, which is very specific, in a very specific

20:00.280 --> 20:06.120
domain without any abstract, without any issues about what does the open source side of the

20:06.120 --> 20:09.680
thing actually change anything in the story.

20:09.680 --> 20:15.200
So having just a paper about a tool which is in research depends a lot on the quality

20:15.200 --> 20:19.360
of the abstract, but it's not enough in a way.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.920
Submitting is very...

20:21.920 --> 20:25.960
The abstract to submit is like a few paragraphs long, so it's really easy to submit.

20:25.960 --> 20:26.960
It's very easy to submit.

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
Please do.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.960
Yes?

20:28.960 --> 20:39.960
I did try to improve the younger sexual legalization, but for disclosure, I was a first member of

20:39.960 --> 20:40.960
the Italian Catholic Student Association.

20:40.960 --> 20:41.960
Okay.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.720
It's a good idea.

20:43.720 --> 20:50.880
So the question is, have we tried PhD associations, a session of PhD students, to email them,

20:50.880 --> 20:52.760
to propose them to submit a talk?

20:52.760 --> 20:53.760
No, we haven't.

20:53.760 --> 20:57.440
No, we haven't, and we are not very good at communication.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.760
Well, I'm bad, but they are good.

20:59.760 --> 21:00.760
Yeah?

21:00.760 --> 21:05.280
Yeah, I have to say, as an academic, I feel, well, as an academic and a developer, I feel

21:05.280 --> 21:10.560
like there is a tendency for academic labs to have sort of a rotation of conferences

21:10.560 --> 21:18.680
that they can send out, and it typically is difficult to get added to that as a new conference,

21:18.680 --> 21:22.880
and especially if it's something that's sort of outside of the norm.

21:22.880 --> 21:26.200
And so it's something that I do think...

21:26.200 --> 21:29.480
I think most of the time that's not sort of intentional, it's just there's so much

21:29.480 --> 21:32.040
else going on and people don't really think about it.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.320
So I would second the suggestion of talking to PhD student associations and you're reaching

21:36.320 --> 21:43.880
out to universities, especially universities that might have asked those, to say, hey,

21:43.880 --> 21:51.160
this is an opportunity for interdisciplinary work, opportunity to talk to people who are

21:51.160 --> 21:57.160
more technical, if you're less technical, or people who are more in other disciplines,

21:57.160 --> 22:02.880
because that sort of stuff is in vogue right now as well.

22:02.880 --> 22:12.320
So I think that once you're on the radar, it's going to be easier to get people, it's

22:12.320 --> 22:14.240
just getting on the radar.

22:14.240 --> 22:19.920
So the comment was that actually it's not easy for labs members to actually add one

22:19.920 --> 22:26.720
more communication conference in the list of an already existing kind of standard publication

22:26.720 --> 22:36.600
venue and above all, when this venue like here is really not standard, academically speaking.

22:36.600 --> 22:44.240
But actually the interdisciplinarity of this room will be actually a good way to attract

22:44.240 --> 22:52.760
not only PhD students and to make it clear for academia what this space is basically.

22:52.760 --> 23:16.920
Okay, so that's a very good question, questions like who would in this room define him or

23:16.920 --> 23:19.760
herself as a UX designer?

23:19.760 --> 23:23.040
Can you raise your hand?

23:23.040 --> 23:27.240
There's one there.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.240
So not many, not many.

23:30.240 --> 23:56.920
We're doing research into how usable research and science is, they were trying to figure

23:56.920 --> 24:00.080
out usability and user design.

24:00.080 --> 24:05.800
So the comment was are you aware that actually there is an open design dev room and so the

24:05.800 --> 24:09.200
answer is yes, actually you will co-organize it.

24:09.200 --> 24:13.200
And actually this room is here tomorrow morning, I think.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.000
Afternoon, sorry.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.360
And my personal comment on this is that actually in my career and what I've done in my experience,

24:22.360 --> 24:33.440
UX is very common stone to go beyond the big, big issue of mixing qualitative and quantitative

24:33.440 --> 24:38.880
approach on data as my talk tried to explain.

24:38.880 --> 24:46.440
And that yes, we need designers and we have one here who talked about it and in our previous

24:46.440 --> 24:52.160
lab that was very important, the media lab is a place where they try to do this mix.

24:52.160 --> 25:08.400
We should try to not overlap, it's good this year, the years before and it's annoying I

25:08.400 --> 25:11.360
think we have kind of the same public or partially.

25:11.360 --> 25:15.160
So if we could, I don't know if we can do that, we should ask at least there or whatever.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.160
It's better if we can maintain it separate.

25:17.160 --> 25:25.240
Yeah, at the same time, yeah, we can do that, actually we could talk about what we do.

25:25.240 --> 25:32.040
Right, one last comment is like if you want after the online session, we can have drinks

25:32.040 --> 25:40.600
together in a place which is, tavernier, tavernier, tavernier, we are going to write

25:40.600 --> 25:46.720
that on the board, tavernier is close to here and I'm going to set up the stream here and

25:46.720 --> 25:50.800
so you can stay here and watch it with us if you want.

25:50.800 --> 25:55.320
So it will be on me, we are going to stream the video and the interaction if you want

25:55.320 --> 25:59.800
to ask questions to the speakers, you have to go through the chatroom on the first-day

25:59.800 --> 26:00.800
website.

26:00.800 --> 26:16.800
Thank you.
