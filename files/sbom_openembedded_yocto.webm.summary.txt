In this talk, Joshua Lawton discusses the importance of S-bombs (Software Bill of Materials) in understanding and managing the software components in a system. He explains that S-bombs are important for knowing what software components are present, where they came from, what versions they are, and if they have any vulnerabilities or licensing issues. Lawton also highlights the need for S-bombs to include information about the software supply chain, such as where components come from and when they were built. He provides an example of how S-bombs are generated in the OpenEmbedded project and emphasizes the benefits of generating S-bombs at build time. He concludes by encouraging other developers to add build profile support to their tools and to consider generating S-bombs at build time.
