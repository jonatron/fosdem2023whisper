00:00.000 --> 00:28.520
This is my first conference and I am not very good in English, so forgive me if I say

00:28.520 --> 00:36.880
something wrong. I will speak about the footnotes in multi-column sections. I

00:36.880 --> 00:47.600
worked on this in last year, a year ago. I thought it can be an interesting

00:47.600 --> 01:00.200
problem. Oh, I had to go back. Okay, so I got a back ticket to a fix and it was a

01:00.200 --> 01:05.480
very simple ticket at first sight. It was only just a one line text and

01:05.480 --> 01:11.400
somehow the writer displayed it as two pages and while the word was displayed

01:11.400 --> 01:19.240
just one page. Beside the one line text there was a footnote and its sections

01:19.240 --> 01:24.800
has two columns and there was a continuous section break. First I talked,

01:24.800 --> 01:32.300
it's just a problem about the section break, some why it's changed to a page

01:32.300 --> 01:38.040
break or something like that, but that was an instinct. It was a strange thing

01:38.040 --> 01:46.320
why the footnote and the column was needed. If I deleted any of them then the

01:46.320 --> 01:54.600
writer changed to one page and it was okay, but I wasn't, it was changed why

01:54.600 --> 02:03.480
it is needed. So I started to debug to find where it's become to a page and I

02:03.480 --> 02:09.960
found the problem in the layout in calculation and there was even a

02:09.960 --> 02:19.480
comment about it stating that the footnote container causes to

02:19.480 --> 02:30.400
maximize size in this case. This function to maximize function will calculate if we

02:30.400 --> 02:40.640
have to maximize the column frame, the whole section frame, to the whole page

02:40.640 --> 02:50.080
and it has several conditions like is footnote at end and is endnote at end.

02:50.080 --> 02:59.200
They are checkboxes on the GUI named the collected end of text and the

02:59.200 --> 03:06.920
collected end of section for end nodes. They are, they was false in this case. Oh

03:06.920 --> 03:14.840
the hasfollow isn't matter now, it was false in this case too, but there was

03:14.840 --> 03:22.160
another function that contains footnote container. I checked this function and

03:22.160 --> 03:32.440
this function just blindly check if the section have column frame tried that

03:32.440 --> 03:38.600
has of footnote container frame tried and if it has one then it returned the

03:38.600 --> 03:45.160
first one it found. So now it seems the function was directly

03:45.160 --> 03:53.240
righted like this way. So the question is was why do we want to break a page in

03:53.240 --> 04:03.320
this case? I even checked the git who changed it or something like that but it

04:03.320 --> 04:11.720
was in the very first commit I could reach in the initial import at 2000

04:11.720 --> 04:19.600
year and nobody changed it and I was even wonder why this many condition is

04:19.600 --> 04:27.520
needed not just the first one I found but the not collected end is still needed

04:27.520 --> 04:38.600
for it. For this I had to analyze the frames how they work so I listed the

04:38.600 --> 04:47.880
frames related to footnote some case. The footnote frame is for one footnote

04:47.880 --> 04:57.200
entity it can contain a text frame and this can be in a footnote container

04:57.200 --> 05:08.280
frame and that frame contains a list of footnotes. It's important it's not

05:08.280 --> 05:15.720
two-dimensional list it's just a simpler list that it can display and this

05:15.720 --> 05:26.120
footnote container frame can be in a page frame or a column frame. So what is

05:26.120 --> 05:31.800
important in it that the footnote container frame does not really support

05:31.800 --> 05:39.880
columns it just I could say just one column of footnotes and that's all but

05:39.880 --> 05:48.360
we can put this container frame in any of the column frame event so if we put

05:48.360 --> 05:55.640
this container frames in every column frame then it will seems like if we

05:55.640 --> 06:11.120
support it's like support multi columns. So in one case we want footnote like

06:11.120 --> 06:17.760
multi columns as like it's in the world in the other case we want if we don't

06:17.760 --> 06:23.240
check the collected end text we want the footnote to be at the page and in the

06:23.240 --> 06:29.360
other case we want the footnote to be in the columns end in physically but as we

06:29.360 --> 06:35.320
say in the display and it can be true only if the column end is equal to the

06:35.320 --> 06:42.920
page end so that's why they maximize the size of the column to the page size. In

06:42.920 --> 06:51.600
our case it's not a good idea because in my test case there was only one

06:51.600 --> 07:05.240
footnote and it doesn't need to be multi columns but if we wouldn't do this what

07:05.240 --> 07:14.240
I showed in the previous slide there could be a contradiction like I made a

07:14.240 --> 07:23.560
test document there is two sections I checked the collected end of text which

07:23.560 --> 07:31.600
means I want the footnote to be after the section end there is two columns at the

07:31.600 --> 07:37.520
first section and three columns at the second section it's very good in this

07:37.520 --> 07:43.800
way but if we would change the collected end of text we would uncheck this

07:43.800 --> 07:50.080
I mean we want all of this footnote at the end of the page then how many columns

07:50.080 --> 07:56.240
you want to how many columns you want it's a contradiction we can't say that

07:56.240 --> 08:10.520
two or three because any of them could be wrong. So what we should need we

08:10.520 --> 08:20.600
should be able to have column childrens for the container frame because it's not

08:20.600 --> 08:31.160
should be but it must be it just should be like words able to have indifferent

08:31.160 --> 08:38.600
number of columns at page as many as in the text so we should have a

08:38.600 --> 08:47.120
ability for the users to choose how many columns you want in the footnote but

08:47.120 --> 09:10.720
we should keep the ability to that's all okay sorry and it's almost end.
