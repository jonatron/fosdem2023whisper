00:00.000 --> 00:12.320
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for coming to this presentation. I'm Nicolas Roland from

00:12.320 --> 00:20.560
the Gustave F.L. University. Thank you. Please. And I will be presenting some research we

00:20.560 --> 00:28.480
did on crowdsourced zones data. Some analysis we did with free open source software. I will

00:28.480 --> 00:36.640
be presenting the work we did with myself, Pierre Romon and Ludovic Moison from the Gustave F.L.

00:36.640 --> 00:45.840
University. So traffic noise is a major health concern. In Europe, in western Europe, it's

00:45.840 --> 00:56.840
estimated by the World Health Organization that we lost 1 million healthy life years each year.

00:56.840 --> 01:10.960
In France, we have estimated the social cost, so the cost to the community of 1,147 billion euros

01:10.960 --> 01:23.760
per year. So it has a cost on a monetary cost, but also a cost on people and their health. So the

01:23.760 --> 01:33.360
big question is, oh, we can find where noise is problematic. And so, of course, we can't

01:33.360 --> 01:42.840
have a direct measure on the everywhere. We can't put microphones everywhere. It will be a cost

01:42.840 --> 01:50.800
nightmare, a logistic nightmare, and a privacy nightmare. Of course, it's not possible. So the

01:50.800 --> 02:00.000
traditional way is to simulate the noise from traffic counts. So we put counters on the road

02:00.000 --> 02:08.800
and count the vehicles and estimate the vehicles. We do that on trains, we do that on planes,

02:08.800 --> 02:18.000
air trucks, and we simulate those traffic and we produce this kind of cars with, for example,

02:18.000 --> 02:28.280
noise modeling, which is an application we developed with the Hummerau laboratory that can

02:28.280 --> 02:36.920
compute from these counts noise maps. And this is a legal requirement by the European Commission.

02:36.920 --> 02:46.520
Another way that the Hummerau, which is working on environmental acoustics, it's a lab on

02:46.520 --> 02:56.720
acoustic, is not to simulate, but to get actual data, real data from contributors using a smartphone

02:56.720 --> 03:05.800
application you can install. It's working on real smartphones. It's available on F-Droid. So it's

03:05.800 --> 03:14.640
also a free open source software. And it measures several things like your position. The sound

03:14.640 --> 03:22.000
spectrum, or not the full spectrum, it's just the third octave. So you can't understand what

03:22.000 --> 03:30.280
people are saying, if it's someone speaking, but you can detect that someone is speaking.

03:30.280 --> 03:39.440
You also have the sound level and some kind of information. So it's part of a bigger project,

03:39.440 --> 03:46.520
like the noise-present project. So we have this noise modeling application that generates

03:46.520 --> 03:53.560
noise from open source geodata, mostly French geodata and open script map. So when you use

03:53.560 --> 04:01.200
script complete to say, okay, this is grass and this is macadam, we use that data to generate

04:01.200 --> 04:08.960
more precise maps, sound maps, noise capture to measure and share sound environments. And all

04:08.960 --> 04:15.160
of this data is given in a special data infrastructure called Onomap. And there is also

04:15.160 --> 04:25.000
some community maps made by the users. This is a map of all the recordings we have in nearly

04:25.000 --> 04:32.200
five years. So you can see it's worldwide. It's just not only France or Europe, it's worldwide.

04:32.200 --> 04:44.160
So the question was, what can you do with all this data we collect? So there was an

04:44.160 --> 04:53.560
extraction in 2021 of the three first years of data collection. So it's still collecting the

04:53.560 --> 05:05.560
data, but there was an extract that contains 260,000 tracks. So the track is recording worldwide.

05:05.560 --> 05:12.200
With the sound spectrum, like I said, GPS location and also the contributor can provide some tags.

05:12.200 --> 05:25.600
It's an open database license. So it's free to use. So the question is, oh, we can characterize the

05:25.600 --> 05:29.920
user environment, the sound environment of the user at the moment of the recording with the

05:29.920 --> 05:40.080
collected data. We think of two possibilities. One is from the sound spectrum. We record. So

05:40.080 --> 05:46.960
it's an ongoing analysis. It's not the very, it's the hardest way to do that because we have to

05:46.960 --> 05:57.000
find patterns on the recordings. And we have to use machine learnings to detect these patterns

05:57.000 --> 06:04.800
on all of these data. So it's still going, but there is only the easiest way. And this is the way

06:04.800 --> 06:15.720
I use. It's by using the tags that are provided by the contributors. So in the subset, like I

06:15.720 --> 06:29.960
say, 260,000 tracks, half of them have tags. So we can use just half of it. 50,000 are where

06:29.960 --> 06:38.840
outdoors are not test. So we want to work on this sound environment. So we discard indoors and test

06:38.840 --> 06:51.960
tagged tracks. We also remove the very, very small ones. So less than five seconds. So we remove

06:51.960 --> 07:02.760
maybe tracks that are not, that might be accident, accidental. And we also work for this just this

07:02.760 --> 07:08.080
preliminary works on France because we are French and it's easier for us to understand what's

07:08.080 --> 07:19.360
happening. And it's nearly 12,000 tracks. And like I said, it's a major, the road noise is a

07:19.360 --> 07:28.720
major concern. And it appears directly in our data because the more frequent tag is the road. So

07:28.720 --> 07:41.800
people are on maybe a third of our subset. There is one noise in it. The second one is chatting.

07:41.800 --> 07:50.640
And so we have also things like wiring, animal sounds, works. So there is 12 tags, different

07:50.640 --> 08:02.920
tags the user can provide. So we use a quite simple one toolkit to analyze the data. First is

08:02.920 --> 08:13.600
the PostgreSQL and Postgres database because the data is provided as PostgreSQL dump. So in order

08:13.600 --> 08:21.760
to access it, you have to rebuild the data and the database. And the tool we use is R because we

08:21.760 --> 08:28.240
are in the team, we are mostly R user. We also have Python, but we are more familiar with R. So

08:28.240 --> 08:37.920
two tools, simple, yes, actually not really, because we also use in R a lot of packages,

08:37.920 --> 08:48.640
like the Tideverse, the SF packages for your special, your JSON stats and so on. And we

08:48.640 --> 08:55.880
also, all of these packages use dependencies like pandoc, markdown, reveal.js. This presentation

08:55.880 --> 09:03.440
actually is made with R and reveal.js. We also use geospatial libraries, like proge,

09:03.440 --> 09:14.000
gos, gilal. And those are dependencies that are not handled by R directly. You just call them.

09:14.000 --> 09:22.120
So what we define in this dataset, so let's talk about results. We got some interesting

09:22.120 --> 09:32.200
things to add. The first thing we looked at, we looked at it was the animal tags because we know

09:32.200 --> 09:46.320
that bird songs can be heard mostly the first hour before dawn. So we can, this is a well-known

09:46.320 --> 09:56.520
dynamics in ornithology. And in the sound environment, we can earn it. And we actually

09:56.520 --> 10:04.400
find it also. So in this graph, you can see on the left part, it's the time before the sunrise

10:04.400 --> 10:19.080
on the day of recording. So we find this actual dynamics of birds singing one hour before dawn.

10:19.080 --> 10:32.160
So it was a good sign. And we also find peaks of road noise between 8 to 10 a.m. and 6 to 8 p.m.

10:32.160 --> 10:45.240
And it's, we can say, it looks like very much like commuters behavior. But we can't directly,

10:45.240 --> 10:52.160
we can't directly link to it. You can say, oh, it's very similar to. So we looked to physical

10:52.160 --> 11:04.120
events in the environment of the contributor. And we find a very good correlation between the wind

11:04.120 --> 11:13.720
force and the present of tags, the wind tags in the dataset. So it's very, it works very well.

11:13.720 --> 11:24.160
We also did that with rainfall. And the correlation is not so strong. Not as enough. It might be

11:24.160 --> 11:35.040
a user bias. Maybe if the rainfall is too small, the user doesn't hear the rain or doesn't think

11:35.040 --> 11:43.920
to add the tag about it. And it might be also a special issue because the nearest, the mean nearest

11:43.920 --> 11:49.920
waiver station distances is 16 kilometers. So maybe the local condition might be different

11:49.920 --> 11:58.080
between the waiver station and the user at the moment of the recording. So it's not so strong,

11:58.080 --> 12:06.320
but actually find data. I'm not the first one to speak about reproducible science here,

12:06.320 --> 12:14.520
actually. And it's an issue, a real issue. So for this today, we have some good points. Like,

12:14.520 --> 12:22.320
the data is already available. The source code, we made it available. So all SQL scripts to

12:22.320 --> 12:31.800
rebuild the database and the table we used are available. The R notebooks we made are also

12:31.800 --> 12:41.320
available. The setup broadly is available. But there are also bad things to assess. So some

12:41.320 --> 12:50.760
notebooks were very wide and we went very deep on the analysis and the exploratory phase. But

12:50.760 --> 12:58.800
at the end, it was very hard to reproduce even in our team. We actually were able to do it. But

12:58.800 --> 13:07.360
for someone coming from outside, it might be difficult to enter in that. So we need some code

13:07.360 --> 13:18.400
factoring and more, a little bit more commenting, more explanation. And so there is also a lack

13:18.400 --> 13:29.640
of information on software environment. So it makes it very hard to reuse and reproduce. So what

13:29.640 --> 13:42.200
could we have used to have a better tooling? Since we use R, you can use RMF, which is our

13:42.200 --> 13:51.080
package to reproduce. It's like a virtual environment. It works well, but it works well just

13:51.080 --> 14:03.480
for R. And we use other software like POSJS. We use JOS, Proj, Jidal. So it's not perfect. Docker

14:03.480 --> 14:14.800
might be something that can be helpful. But like Simon said before, it's not perfect for

14:14.800 --> 14:24.960
reproducibility. And I just say Goix is my examined mind from one year, actually, to say,

14:24.960 --> 14:30.160
okay, I need to work on that. And I think it would be a good solution. I won't talk too much

14:30.160 --> 14:38.320
because there was a talk by Simon Tornier just two talks before, and I go watch it. I think it

14:38.320 --> 14:47.840
might be a very good solution. In conclusion, so we can use code-sourced data. Oh, perfect. We can

14:47.840 --> 14:54.880
use code-sourced data for science. We can find, even for something quirky like some environment,

14:54.880 --> 15:01.880
we can use it for science. This particular data set is usable. So you can access it and find new

15:01.880 --> 15:08.080
things. We don't have every question. So we don't have every answer to, we can answer with this

15:08.080 --> 15:17.840
data set. So it's quite fun to play with it and find some, oh, we can find birds. I do believe that

15:17.840 --> 15:24.600
free open source software are key for reproducible science. We can't make reproducible science with

15:24.600 --> 15:31.880
proper software. It's not possible. Repositible science is hard to achieve. You have to think it

15:31.880 --> 15:38.920
as soon as possible before starting your project. Because when you are too far, you have to refactor

15:38.920 --> 15:54.240
things and it can be very tricky. And you have, maybe, I'm working with, this is more a sound and

15:54.240 --> 16:02.480
physics-related study, but sometimes I work with economists. I work with geographers. And they are

16:02.480 --> 16:15.720
not often very keen on technologies and computers in general. So sometimes you need someone, maybe

16:15.720 --> 16:23.040
an engineer or someone in the team that can handle this reproducible part. And so you need to get

16:23.040 --> 16:29.960
the skills. So either you get yourself or you have to take someone in the team that can do that for

16:29.960 --> 16:40.680
you. And notebooks are not enough. Notebooks are great to communicate and explore things, but they

16:40.680 --> 16:48.880
are not good enough for reproducible science. So there's a link for the data set, the actual

16:48.880 --> 16:55.440
data set. Please go to checknoiseplanet.org. You can navigate on the map. You can see actually

16:55.440 --> 17:04.240
tracks and click on things to get what is recorded. Thank you for your attention. You can have, you

17:04.240 --> 17:13.160
can join me by email or on Mastodon. This presentation is available here and everything is

17:13.160 --> 17:27.200
accessible on GitHub. Thank you very much. Thanks. That leaves us a bit of time for questions. So

17:27.200 --> 17:55.000
please feel free to take them, repeat them, and then answer them. Yeah. In the graph with the bird. Yeah. You had a sort of a dip at zero. Yeah. Yeah. So the

17:55.000 --> 18:05.720
question was about this particular graph, why there is a low beam at the zero and the peak is just above the zero.

18:05.720 --> 18:15.320
Because it's smoothed a little bit. And you can see there is a peak just before and the line is just

18:15.320 --> 18:29.840
moving and there is little shifting. But and you think why is there is a low? I don't know. I'm not sure. Yeah, please.

18:29.840 --> 18:39.680
Yeah. Because we are doing crowdsourcing data, so it's obviously influenced by the users that's

18:39.680 --> 18:47.120
collecting the data for us. Yeah. How do you factor in or how do you eliminate this source of variance where it could be underlying

18:47.120 --> 18:58.520
behavior of humans that is affecting the results of the data. For example, sunrise time. So people who get awakened by birds

18:58.520 --> 19:06.600
during before sunrise, they will be very annoyed and they record more. People who wake up at the normal times are too busy to even make the

19:06.600 --> 19:22.080
recording. Okay. So the question was about this is called source of data. So there is there is data that provided by people

19:22.080 --> 19:32.600
willing willing to provide it. And there is a bias, of course, because you may be angry at birds, waking you up in the morning

19:32.600 --> 19:42.800
and you may be angry to traffic noise. And actually, we don't assess the data. We take it as it is. Maybe there will be some I'm not

19:42.800 --> 19:54.840
part of this part of the project, but maybe there will be some some work on it. And we hope that it's so much data that it will

19:54.840 --> 20:07.080
be smooth bias. But of course, it's bias like opens with my data. And there is someone making a decision to say, okay, I will record it for a good

20:07.080 --> 20:23.400
or bad reason or to prove a point. Okay, my where I live in, it's too noisy. I make a recording. And it's okay. But we recount. It's very hard to assess

20:23.400 --> 20:33.920
this kind of information. We don't know why people record tracks, because maybe it's pleasant environment and they want to share it. It's not so good.

20:33.920 --> 20:40.360
And it's okay for us. I hope it's answer your question. Yeah, please.

20:40.360 --> 20:53.920
Yeah. So I just wanted to ask, because I think a wind is pretty hard to incorporate. Because when somebody records, they probably recorded without the pop filter, which makes the sound really loud of the wind,

20:53.920 --> 21:03.520
despite of not being so loud, because somebody comes up with the phone and records it. And the wind blows straight into it and it's really, really loud as kind of like

21:03.520 --> 21:25.640
indecent. Okay, the question was about the wind recordings and the fact that smartphone doesn't have a pop shield and protect the microphone from the wind. And so

21:25.640 --> 21:43.640
actually, I'm not an acoustician. I'm more a jazz engineer. So I don't have the exact question for that. But I do believe when you are using your microphone, when you're talking,

21:43.640 --> 21:58.640
talking, smartphone, no, nowadays, can protect you a little bit from the noise. But I'm not sure from education. Yeah, please.

21:58.640 --> 22:04.640
My question is kind of connected to the bias one. But when you were building the data capture, like...

22:04.640 --> 22:17.640
Did you build the data capture tool where people are inputting data, right? Or how was that built? And did you make sure that people could use it in a way that...

22:17.640 --> 22:25.640
Like, how did you make sure that people were comfortable using it in the situations that you needed recordings for?

22:25.640 --> 22:46.640
So the question was... Can you simplify it? So I'm interested in what choices you made in order to have the thing look and function how it did to capture the data and, like, again, to bias.

22:46.640 --> 22:55.640
So if people are, like, not able to use it or don't like using it, does that also bias the data?

22:55.640 --> 23:22.640
So you're not speaking... So the question was about how we build the analysis and how we build it. If you are not able to use R to build the... Sorry. Actually, we have to make a choice and we are more comfortable with R.

23:22.640 --> 23:33.640
So there is a bias, of course, and we also have some libraries like SunCalc, for example, that makes life very simpler for us to...

23:33.640 --> 23:52.640
You give it a time, we give it a date and a position and it gives you the sunrise and sunset, thank you, sunset time, for example, so it makes life easier for us.

23:52.640 --> 24:07.640
But, of course, there is a bias. Even when we build the application, there is, of course, a bias. But I wasn't part of the team that built this application.

24:07.640 --> 24:25.640
And it's more focused on what we want to get, but it's available for everyone, so do whatever we want to do with it. Thank you. We have more time, maybe?

24:25.640 --> 24:42.640
On your first slide, you had a really big number in terms of the social costs, only in France. It seems quite egregiously big. Do you know anything about what's included in the social costs?

24:42.640 --> 24:46.640
What are the costs that are incorporated into this number?

24:46.640 --> 24:59.640
As Kim, it's a huge report. Adam is a French agency, an environmental agency, so it works on noise pollution, but also air pollution and things like that.

24:59.640 --> 25:08.640
You are working, sorry, I didn't repeat the question, but the question is about the social cost and the amount and how it is constructed.

25:08.640 --> 25:27.640
So I just read quickly the report. And the social cost is mostly about health issues, lack of sleep and stress related to noise and things like that.

25:27.640 --> 25:44.640
And how it affects people and how it affects their health and how it affects less-better health as a cost for society because you have more anxiety.

25:44.640 --> 26:00.640
Thank you very much.
