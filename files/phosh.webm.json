{"text": " Okay, the room is full. It's still one minute to go, but I think we can get started. Welcome Evangeles, what's new in the world of Hosh. He is a Mobian member, a purest employee, so he knows what he's talking about. So welcome to my talk and thank you for the nice words. We'll see whether I really know what I'm talking about or not. Maybe you can correct me if I speak out of it. Since you already did the introductions, there's not much that needs adding right now. Since I'm interested, how many people here in this room, maybe by show of hands, are currently running Linux first phone? Okay, that's nice. I mean you're in the right room then. And out of those people, how many people are running Hosh? Okay, that's like I guess half of it or something. That's great. Okay, so yeah, what is Hosh for those of you who might not know? It's a graphical shell for Wayland and it's aimed at mobile devices so you can use it with touch-based inputs. The UI is written in GTK and we'll get back to that later on why that is really nice that it's written in GTK. And maybe just as a short history, originally Hosh started its life on the Librim 5 and on the pure as distribution developed by purism which heavily invested in getting the GNOME based mobile software ecosystem starting, I would say. And so while it originally was written with the Librim 5 in mind, it quickly spread to other distributions and now also runs on a lot of different devices as well as if you saw the other talks, for example, our most talked by Mobian, you see that there's like Pinephone, Pinephone Pro, all the Pocophone and so on. And maybe one thing that bears noting is all of these projects, they are working really great together from my perspective as like some or upstream for some of the projects. And it's really great to see all this cross-pollination going on between the different projects and distributions. So now to what has happened in the last year. I guess most notably is the swiping gestures that were implemented. So you can see in the video, for example, how it really tracks your finger movement and it looks very nice. And yeah, that is already probably old news to some of the people here in this room, but I think that was one of the greatest improvements in terms of usability because you, at least if you're anything like me, you would always accidentally open up the app drawer because when you were aiming for the space key and you just went the one pixel below that. Yeah, so gone are those days. Apart from that, there's been a bunch of quality of life improvements. You got, for example, you can turn on and off VPN in the quick settings. The quick settings are actually now also accessible from the lock screen itself. And there's been all sorts of design overhauls and making sure the buttons and everything look really nice thanks to the people that work on design and so on. Another thing that I find really enjoyable to use are the lock screen plugins so you can have plugins to put some widget tree onto your lock screen. So in these examples, you see a simple proof of concept calendar widget, like the one on the left that is probably not that useful unless you just happen to forget the date and then it's great. Upcoming events is something that I really enjoy because you see at a glance what's going on next. Emergency information is also something that you can have displayed there. And also notably, if you want to show tickets when the train conductor comes by, you can do that from the comfort of your lock screen. You can actually turn on or off these plugins in the fresh mobile settings application, which has a few different plugins you can enable or disable and other settings like, well, you want the keypad on the lock screen to shuffle whenever it's there so no spying eyes can learn your pin from watching unless they watch really, really closely. This is some more images from the mobile settings application. So for one, you might find some device specific things there. And in the compositor settings, which is also shown in the video on the right, you can, for example, enable scaling applications with windows that are overflowing down to have them fit on your small mobile screen. Then we also have a nice thing that came about while at Debconf in Kosovo where it was really nice weather. And the main developer implemented automatic high contrast switching between dark and light variants based on what the ambient light sensor would show you. And if you want to try that out, currently you would need to use these G settings and you may need to adjust the threshold for your case and to make sure that it works for you. But depending on how sunny it exactly is. Apart from that, there were a few design overhauls on the calls side and also maybe notably to people who have large call history, it starts up a lot faster than it used to. And also the scrolling performance in the history has much improved. It will get even better with GTK4, which is on the road map, but with GTK3 resulting to some hack, limiting the amount of widgets that is displayed in the list box makes a lot of difference, especially on weaker hardware like the PinePhone itself. And you can also, I don't know if you're aware, but you can long press the entries in the call history and from there you can start sending, for example, a new SMS or if it's an unknown number added to a contact and so on. Apart from that, oh, that image should have, yeah, okay, not been there, but yeah, it's calls that can also be used to make voice over IP calls using the session initiation protocol that's been implemented some time ago and it should work for you, so if you have a, I don't know, jump chat or sip gate or something account, you can use that for phone calls or sorry, voice over IP calls. And during last year, supporting encrypted media streams is also something that has landed. Actually, the call display will not tell you right now that it's an encrypted call, but you can trust me on that. On the chatty side, like the SMS application, or SMS and more, I should rather say, there was a lot of work on MMS especially, thanks to having MMSD. There was a lot of work on group messaging flows and there's also work still ongoing on Matrix, but that is something that I'm personally very excited about. Then maybe in the wider ecosystem, one of the things in GNOME that I really enjoyed is that we now have dark style preferences with latest Lipadvita and also in Lipendi. And if you want to know more, you can, I guess you can't click on the links, but if you go to the slides, there's some blog posts that I linked right here. And maybe just a few examples of some of the applications that have been made adaptive since I think pretty much all of the GNOME course applications are now adaptive. Yeah, Contacts, GNOME Software, and there's lots of things to look forward to, as I said, Matrix and Chatty is one of them. And yeah, fixing paper cuts because I think we're in a position with Fosh right now where it's, as was evident by all the people raising their hands earlier, that is in a good shape. There's still things that could be better, but it's definitely usable as a daily driver-ish. Okay, and yeah, if you want to reach out, look at the slides and thank you. Three minutes for questions, plenty of time. Yes. I don't think there is, if you look at the, or maybe I'm wrong, but if you look at the notifications specification, I'm not sure that you can put real widgets on with all the bells and whistles. You can tell that there's, or as an application you can say, hey, here's an action, so the notification will give you some button to click on, which will then, I don't know, do something, reply to a message or something, but I don't think custom widgetry would work at all, because you'd also need, how would that work? Like, if it's a QT app and yeah. Probably embedding it in the Wayland service would be complicated, but the word widget is, I mean, it's already built on GDK, so maybe. Okay. Oh, it's not specific to GDK though. Specification is process, it has to work on X or on P and Wayland, so you can't embed something. I mean, probably since it's free software, there's always ways you could do things, but I personally, I'm not entirely sure how exactly you would implement something like this. Yes, hold on. Okay, I have a question. In the convergent mode, you have the application list there, and it would be great if you can press some button or get to something and say, make this application now running in full screen on the external device, external screen or or maybe it is there is some combinations. Yeah. You mean like from the when launching the application? Okay. If you swipe. Yeah, I'm not sure how like from the spatial model of since you already have these swipes to the to the right and left to go between the the open applications, I'm not sure like how would you need to. I see, go press and some menu. Ah, okay, yeah, that's because it is quite missing for me. Okay, that's good to know. Please file a back.
