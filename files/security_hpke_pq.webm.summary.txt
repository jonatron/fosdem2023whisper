The talk covers HPK or hybrid public key encryption, a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption. It uses key encapsulation mechanism for key exchange and supports various algorithms for key derivation and AEAD encryption. The talk also covers the post-quantum aspect of HPK, where post quantum algorithms can be used for the key encapsulation method to make it post-quantum secure. The security of the base mode is INCCI2 secure and authenticated modes are outside and inside the CCS secure. KYBER is one such NIST finalist for key exchange methods in post-quantum. The talk also covers benchmarks for HPK and post-quantum HPK. Finally, the talk also covers possible messages that could use HPK, including messaging layer security, TLS client hello, and Oblivios DNS over HTTPS. There is also a Q&A section on the constraints of post-quantum crypto on devices.
