The speaker, Nicolas Frankel, starts by acknowledging the audience of developers, operations (ops) professionals, and DevOps professionals. He emphasizes that the talk will focus on tracing, as he believes it is the most challenging aspect of monitoring. He introduces the concept of tracing, which helps understand the flow of a business request across all components. He mentions existing tracing pioneers and states that a more standardized approach is desired, which can be achieved with the OpenTelemetry project. OpenTelemetry is a CNCF project that provides APIs, SDKs, and tools to implement tracing. The architecture of OpenTelemetry is explained, which involves sources, the OpenTelemetry protocol, and a collector. The talk then delves into practical examples of auto-instrumentation with Java, Python, and Rust. The speaker demonstrates how instrumentation can be applied in these languages without adding many dependencies or extra code. In the examples, he uses Docker Compose to set up the instrumentation environment and demonstrates the traces in the Jaeger UI. The speaker also mentions the option for developers to perform manual instrumentation when they become more comfortable with tracing. The talk concludes with the speaker encouraging attendees to follow him on Twitter, check out his GitHub repository for implementing tracing themselves, and mentioning the Apache APISIX project. In the Q&A session, some questions touched on topics like the overhead of instrumentation in Python and Java, issues with multi-threading or multi-processing, configurability of the OpenTelemetry agent, support for error handling, and integration with logging tools like Sentry.
