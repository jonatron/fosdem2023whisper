00:00.000 --> 00:11.520
So you're almost having like a synchronous Q&A session and I, you know, that just makes

00:11.520 --> 00:14.640
life easier for a lot of people, including presenters, right?

00:14.640 --> 00:17.680
Because you know what to sort of expect.

00:17.680 --> 00:22.440
The last one is sort of similar.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.280
I saw this, like, Linux Foundation did this, like, a few years ago.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.400
I, you know, I made a presentation, again, with Sophia on documentation, and then there

00:32.400 --> 00:38.120
was like a Slack channel for Q&As, and after our presentation, we were on there for like

00:38.120 --> 00:43.080
30, 45 minutes, which I thought was great, because typically when you're at a convention

00:43.080 --> 00:48.040
center, you kind of get shoot out after your presentation, so people only have like a five

00:48.040 --> 00:51.640
minute window to ask you questions, like if you ran out of time, right?

00:51.640 --> 00:58.200
This just gave us a lot more time to answer questions, and also for people to be, you

00:58.200 --> 01:02.400
know, vocal with their comments and feedback, which I thought was great, and I made sure

01:02.400 --> 01:07.600
that I let a lot of people know that I thought that was pretty awesome.

01:07.600 --> 01:14.000
So I know I'm almost out of time, so I think I've covered most of these.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.560
So it's not either or.

01:16.560 --> 01:22.760
The virtual events can complement what you're doing, like, in person, and, you know, just

01:22.760 --> 01:26.640
remember that we've been doing, like, a virtual collaboration for a long time, and this is

01:26.640 --> 01:32.560
definitely an important toolkit to help community members, and then especially for people who

01:32.560 --> 01:37.640
can't always travel for whatever reason, financial or otherwise.

01:37.640 --> 01:43.920
And the final point I want to make, actually, the platforms that we're using for online

01:43.920 --> 01:49.040
events, like including Hopin, I mean, I'm not saying that's my favorite tool, but even

01:49.040 --> 01:54.320
Hopin has really evolved over time, and one of the things I noticed when I talked to event

01:54.320 --> 01:58.800
manager and vendors is that they'll give a list of, here are the virtual event platforms

01:58.800 --> 02:00.520
that we support.

02:00.520 --> 02:05.400
One company, they provided, like, 15 logos, including, like, Hopin, so there are just

02:05.400 --> 02:11.360
more alternatives available, so I think we have better platforms and tools to run events

02:11.360 --> 02:17.840
virtually, and, yeah, I just, I think that's it, I just want to make sure I have time for

02:17.840 --> 02:18.840
questions.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.840
Hopefully you'll leave it to me after I thank you.

02:21.840 --> 02:27.360
Great, because it's you, you can do one question, even though we're over time, because we think

02:27.360 --> 02:28.360
you're awesome.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.360
All right, thank you.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.360
Anyone want to ask a question?

02:30.360 --> 02:31.360
I see a hand.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.360
Off we go.

02:32.360 --> 02:42.360
You are the final question of the community, Debra, for FOSDOM 2023, congratulations.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.480
Well, thank you very much for the talk.

02:44.480 --> 02:50.600
We have a global market, but obviously we don't have big resources like big companies,

02:50.600 --> 03:00.800
so I wonder how much it is to set up the whole logistic of the virtual event live streaming.

03:00.800 --> 03:05.840
Because we definitely have a global market, so obviously you can't be relying on everyone

03:05.840 --> 03:13.000
assisting to your event if you do it in person, but I'm thinking probably the best thing is

03:13.000 --> 03:18.800
to just record it and then put it available online a week later or something like that,

03:18.800 --> 03:24.720
rather than having to live stream it as a proper hybrid event, what do you think?

03:24.720 --> 03:33.480
Well, the question for people online, because even Zoom is not free, and then is it okay

03:33.480 --> 03:40.320
to pre-record things and make content available for people to consume and ask questions to?

03:40.320 --> 03:44.640
I think that's completely valid, actually one of the things I learned from these vendors,

03:44.640 --> 03:50.040
they don't, on a virtual platform, they actually don't encourage you to have a live presentation

03:50.040 --> 03:55.400
in a Q&A, because there's just a lot more technical difficulties that you can run through.

03:55.400 --> 04:01.520
They call us senior lives, they prefer that they have the presenter record and be available

04:01.520 --> 04:07.320
for 10 minutes of questioning, as an example, but if you don't want to have a person available

04:07.320 --> 04:13.080
10 minutes online for questioning, you can still have a create a Google Doc, here's a

04:13.080 --> 04:18.120
recording, please submit your questions over this period of time and the presenter or other

04:18.120 --> 04:21.440
people can answer them, so it's all documented, right?

04:21.440 --> 04:25.960
So I think that's completely valid, so you don't have to use Zoom, I mean, I just happened

04:25.960 --> 04:30.320
to be, I've been using Zoom for the past few years, so that's what I'm comfortable with,

04:30.320 --> 04:36.920
but you can do a live stream from Google Hangout, but I haven't tried to hands on myself, but

04:36.920 --> 04:42.160
I know it's doable, so that's an option, but having something pre-recorded available

04:42.160 --> 04:47.040
on YouTube channel, but here's a documentation, it could be a Wiki page or Google Docs, please

04:47.040 --> 04:52.920
submit your questions, we'll close the questioning in like seven days and whoever the presenter

04:52.920 --> 04:57.760
was, whoever the content expert is, we'll get back to you with their answers, so I think

04:57.760 --> 05:17.440
that's a completely valid thing to do, it doesn't have to be like 100% interactive, so.
