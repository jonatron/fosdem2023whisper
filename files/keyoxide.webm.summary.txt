In his talk, Jarma Makenbach discussed K-OxEat, a project about verifying online identity with cryptography. K-OxEat is designed to be secure, anonymous, self-sovereign, and decentralized. It allows users to be multiple personas, each with its own identity, and to create, update, delete and distribute their own digital passports. K-OxEat provides a simple but secure way for users to bidirectionally verify their identity and automate the process with its mobile app.
