In this talk, the speaker discusses the importance of generating complete and accurate software bill of materials (SBOMs) for open source projects. They emphasize the need for syntactic correctness, dependency data, licensing information, semantic structure, software identifiers, supplier data, and integrity data in SBOMs. The speaker also mentions tools that can validate SBOMs and score their compliance. They highlight the challenges of dealing with patched software and suggest that more information should be exposed in language ecosystems to support better SBOM generation.
