The talk was about Tissue, a minimalist issue tracker based on Git and plain text files. The speaker discussed the need for simplicity and minimalism in self-hosted software for wide adoption, citing issues with data backup and loss. They demonstrated Tissue's ability to search through documentation, commit messages, and issue files using natural language search, showing how it could be used for both small and large projects like Geeks. The talk concluded with thanks to the G-Network team for their contributions and a hope to attend in person at next year's FOSDEM conference.
