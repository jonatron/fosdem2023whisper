LibreSock is a free and open source ship design project that is creating a family of system on ship products powered by Power Extension Sets and accelerated by 3D upcodes, video codes, and audio decoders and coders. The project is funded partially by grants and donations, and community experts from a variety of sectors. The project employs a fetch-decode-issue-execute pipeline and also utilizes vectorized issues and parallel execution units to increase performance. They have started from the Power Instruction Set Specification, utilizing the manuals provided and Python to auto-generate a decoder and a Python Simulator to test their designs. They have started their testing process with a simple core, and plan to ultimately port a Linux distro and have a full-term GCC with vectorization initiatives and texture upcodes for 3D acceleration.
