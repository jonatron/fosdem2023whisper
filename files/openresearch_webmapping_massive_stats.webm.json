{"text": " So, hello everyone. I'm glad to be here. I am Etienne Combe. I am a researcher at Gustave Eiffel University and I will talk about a site project that I have from the right time ago and try to tell the story of this site project with concern web mapping and statistical data and how quickly how the OpenStreetMap stack have changed the way we show and diffuse statistical data. Okay, so this is a background that I will skip and I will go back in time eight years ago. I was on a project and I was working on a massive graded statistical data set that are called Don\u00e9 Caroyer in French and this data are derived from tax sheets and they are given at a very detailed spatial scale so pixels of 200 meters by 200 meters on all the French territories and you have several variables like population structures, number of people under 10 above 17 and so on and you have also information about the revenue of the people and this data set reached the statistical limit of statistical secrets so in some of the pixels are less than 11 households so the data are aggregated in order to be above this threshold which is forced by the law. Okay, so the more precise data set that we may have on the French population. Okay, and the distribution of this data set at this time was like this so the first step was to go on the INSEE website, find this page. It was already quite hard because it was in a very deep part of the website and you have to download two files in a very specific file format like DBF and MIFMID which were coming from a map and for software so a G software from the 80s and you have to deal with that. Okay, so not very easy. You already have a QGIS way to read that so there is already an open source software to read the data but the exploration was not very easy and and friendly. Okay, so this is the help page to read the data, load them in QGIS and so on but if you are not a G specialist it was quite difficult to deal with that. Okay, and I was working with my student on this data set and at the end of the thesis we had the idea to try to improve a little bit that and we seen an opportunity. So the context I have already given, EV file, tricky file format and also projection problem in the data set at this time, usable with a lot of pain and with dedicated software like map info, ArcGIS or QGIS and the opportunity that we have seen at this time was the web mapping stacks that was developed around the OSM project. So open layer was already there, leaflet also and mapbox tools were also on the rise with at this time this was a timing platform that allowed to build custom map web maps. Okay, and we had seconds that this will allow to renew the data diffusion visualization approaches. Okay, we were not alone, Oliver O'Brien in UK did a quite similar proposal in 2015 with DataShine, this is a screen of DataShine at this time which was built using open layer and he had to build one stack of tags for each features he wanted to be visible on the map. So in all of this interface you may choose between several features, so more than 50, less than 10, the revenue or so on and he had to build all these these tags, so a lot of work. And at the same time there was a technology that was coming which is called vector tags, so the tags that were used to build the map are no more images but are vector file format solutions. So it was the very beginning of this this approach and I have recovered some of the first tech notes about some solution from the open source community about vector tags and for statistical data this was a massive advantage because you may put all the data in the tag and adapt the visualization on the front end and you did not have to produce one tag set for every feature, so it was very advantageous and very interesting and we tried to build something around that and the tools were not existing completely at this time, so the first toolchain was something like some earth creep to process the data and export vector tags in geogizon format, a leaflet map to draw the map and a detroit hook to render the vector tags on the canvas and to animate all this. And some tricks to try something with interactivity because if you draw something on canvas it's not so easy to know on which part of the map you are and we try to to put some some some love in the details about the color scales, some background on the labels and the data that were produced by the French administration were square, so there is one well-known problem with statistical data, special statistical data which is called a modifiable area unit problem which says that when you change the regression levels you will see different things and you may find different patterns and we see that this can be an opportunity in fact and we will try to aggregate the raw data at different scales and link these scales with the zoom levels, so this will solve two problems we need to keep the vector tags a little bit small because we are on the web so we didn't want to download 10 mega and so on so this will be solved by the aggregations and because of the mob we want to explore several aggregation scales so this was a possibility that were interesting so this first solution is still is still usable 8 years ago and it's it's already cool so you have a map you may zoom you may look for a place and so on and you may find a precise location you may switch the features that you want to look at and you didn't have to download the big file open a g software and it's quite more easy okay so this was the first the first project and we get some feedbacks from the INSEE so we are speaking with the producer of the data also from journalists some journalists who are interested on specific topics and use the tools for example to to study segregations on school or districting your banis also use some of the your banis use that for territorial diagnosis transportation researcher and curious people so it was it was cool and since this first this first version the technology have quite maturated and there is now a very standard way to to to to to deliver vector types which is a MVT format mapbox vector tiles with specifications and pogeys one on database can produce this type of vector types and there is also new front end solutions like mapbox gel which is now no more in open source but the open source project is used by my trip now and that's that's also we have we have a new toolchain and some successors and if you have questions and if you have if you want details about some of these successors it will be a pleasure it's how you split so the question was about vector ties on the meaning of vector ties so when mapping is based on the pyramid of ties and when you zoom a tie is a twill in French yes but it's because in web mapping so to draw the map you have to to build ties that are arranged in a pyramid and when you zoom you download only the part of the of the zoom level that is concerned by the current view so it's too it's too no it's just to optimize the usage of the bond which and to to send only the relevant part of the data to the front end during during the exploration of the of the map from INSEE so just for INSEE they are trying to to to build something similar but from some time now and it's still not not online okay so I have a working on a prototype for them okay so as the next version of the of the solution was built with with INSEE and and they they didn't have sufficiently people inside to to to deal with this type of project I think but it's still not there but if you look at that I shine so almost the same project with with similar tools and in the UK that I shine is now available in in for for the census of the UK it's it's a new version of that I shine that is used okay so I have some hope that at one point in time we will have an official portai in INSEE that will look like that but still not yes but not in the web mapping exploration tools for everybody but I had one versions for for your buddies for examples where they can upload their own shapefives to to to add more layers of your information yes there is European initiative I have forgotten the name but it's it's all derived from the in spear directive which gives some guidelines for our delivering a statistical that has a special statistical dataset and there is also a library from euro stat which is called right this I didn't have with so you may find the links but there is a JavaScript library now which is developed by euro stat to show graded data statistical data", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.44, "text": " So, hello everyone.
