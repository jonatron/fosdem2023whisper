In this talk at the FOSDEM conference, the speaker discusses the importance of real-time stream processing and how it can be applied across various domains, not just in financial institutions or IT. They explain the difference between real-time and batch processing, emphasizing the need for combining real-time and historical data for analysis. The speaker introduces Hazelcast as an open-source platform for real-time stream processing, highlighting its ease of use and scalability. They demonstrate how Hazelcast can be used to analyze and process log data in real-time, enabling alerts and predictions. The speaker also mentions the performance benchmark of Hazelcast compared to Apache Flink in terms of minimizing latency within applications. They conclude the talk by inviting attendees to join an upcoming unconference on real-time stream processing.
