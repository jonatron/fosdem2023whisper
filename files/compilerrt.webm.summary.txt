The talk given by Mamta at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 covered the topics of LLVM and Clang, compiler RT sanitizers, and their implementation and use. LLVM is a compiler framework that provides front-end, back-end, and optimizer functionalities, while Clang is a front-end mostly used for C, C++, and C-like languages. Compiler RT sanitizers are like runtime checks that help detect memory bugs or security flaws, and there are multiple kinds of sanitizers available. Mamta also discussed the implementation of address sanitizer and how it works, along with the process of building and using the sanitizers. Finally, she shared her thoughts on the use of sanitizers in development, how it can improve code quality, and its limitations in production.
