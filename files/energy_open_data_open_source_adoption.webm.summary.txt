David Fioriti from the University of Pisa and co-director of the Pipe Submits Earth Initiative discussed open data and open source adoption in the NSG (Natural Gas and Electric) sector. He addressed the duplication and transparency issues that occur when entities are paying for access to solvers, models, and data to develop specialized models, and emphasized the importance of using open-source tools and avoiding duplication. Fioriti discussed how the Pipe Submits Earth Initiative is tackling the issue by leveraging open data and open-source tools, and working with an existing user base to cut down on duplication. He emphasized the need for better coordination and guidance to work together and produce transparent, replicable results. Ultimately, the initiative aims to accelerate the global energy transition, and improve energy planning and analysis tools.
