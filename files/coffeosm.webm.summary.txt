Michele Tameni gave a talk about how to simplify the process of adding businesses to Openstreet Map. They proposed a system in which users can upload a picture of their receipt and receive back the necessary details to add the business to the map, while protecting the data and user privacy. The system can also check if the business is already present on Openstreet Map, so users don't add redundant entries. The project is still in its early stages, and the speaker was looking for feedback.
