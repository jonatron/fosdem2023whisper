The speaker discusses using AtomVM to run Elixir, Erlang, and Gleam on microcontrollers. The software is compatible with recent OTP releases and requires 80 kilobytes of RAM, making it suitable for constrained devices. Additionally, the speaker mentions a Lisp implementation for testing various communications and multi-core microcontroller support. The project is open source and a result of teamwork.
