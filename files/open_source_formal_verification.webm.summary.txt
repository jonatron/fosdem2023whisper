Fabien Choteau gave a presentation on formal verification and, in particular, open source formal verification. He presented Spark, a framework which consists of tools and a language that can be used to automatically prove the correctness of intended algorithms. He also discussed the advantages of using Aida language and its features, such as contract-based programming, to perform verification. Lastly, he showed an example of how to use Spark to prove a simple code and provided links to resources for learning about Spark.
