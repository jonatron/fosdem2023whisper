This talk was an overview of the open-source project Kazama, which is an application service that bridges Activity Pub and Matrix, two decentralized networks. It provides interoperability between the two networks, allowing users of both networks to easily talk with one another. The project is written in Elixir and utilizes private and public rooms in Matrix to bridge the various activity types, such as post, chat, video, event activities and more. Kazama also allows users to make direct messages, replications, attachments, and mentions. It also supports the 'delete event' on both networks. Finally, the project is supported by NGI0, NLNet and FundedF, and is close to being ready for deployment in home servers.
