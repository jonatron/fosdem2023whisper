The speaker talks about the challenges faced by developers with current CI/CD services, such as issues related to YAML, debugging, and caching, and how Dagger, a portable CI/CD solution using containers, can help solve these challenges. The speaker highlights four reasons why Dagger is great, including portability, the ability to write pipelines in any language, avoiding vendor lock-in, and caching by default. The speaker also demonstrates how to run a pipeline in Go using the Dagger SDK and mentions some areas where Dagger needs improvement, such as secret management and the ability to reuse code across multiple languages.
