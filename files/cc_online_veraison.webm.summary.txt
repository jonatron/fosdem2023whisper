In this presentation from the FOSDEM conference, Thomas, an engineer at TARM and contributor to Project Verazin, introduces Verazin and explains how it fits into the wider picture of translation of natural computing. Verazin is a trusted automated software verification system that can establish a trust relationship between mutually distrusting parties. The presentation covers the various aspects of the project, including the remote attestation architecture, Verazin's role in that architecture, supported formats, and the architecture of the verification API. The talk concludes with information about upcoming improvements to the project and a Q&A session.
