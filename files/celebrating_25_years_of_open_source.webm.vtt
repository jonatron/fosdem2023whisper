00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Hi, everyone. We are getting started right now. This upcoming keynote is called Celebrating

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
25 Years of Open Source. Our speaker is going to be Nick Vidal.

00:21.000 --> 00:34.000
Thank you. Good morning. Bonjour. J.O.'s anniversary. Happy birthday, Open Source. 25 years. Yeah.

00:34.000 --> 00:42.000
So, I had a pleasure to work with the OSI five years ago, together with the board of directors,

00:42.000 --> 00:52.000
and it was a huge success. We organized 100 activities across 40 events worldwide, all the major

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
Open Source conferences, and we plan to do this again this year. 25 years is a huge milestone

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
for the Open Source community, and we need you to help celebrate this.

01:07.000 --> 01:17.000
So, I'm going to tell a bit about the history of Open Source. That's 25 years, but before then,

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
we also have the history of free software, and I'm going to attempt to give a talk about this

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
in about 30 minutes. Let's see how that goes. I have a couple of milestones, a couple of timelines,

01:33.000 --> 01:47.000
and let's see. So, I've created a timeline here. I'm going to give three talks, three timelines,

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
actually three acts. I'm going to first talk about the past of Open Source. Later, I'm going to talk

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
about the future of Open Source, and finally, I'm going to talk about the present of Open Source.

02:00.000 --> 02:09.000
For the past of Open Source, I'm going to be covering 12 timelines, but mostly I'll be focusing on the

02:09.000 --> 02:20.000
Open Source timeline and on the free software timeline. So, let's get started. So, I'm going to...

02:20.000 --> 02:29.000
So, let's go... Before talking about Open Source, let's go to the free software timeline.

02:29.000 --> 02:40.000
You can actually access this. It's aniv.co, and let's go here, and let's go back to 1955.

02:40.000 --> 02:51.000
So, this is a long time ago, and in 1955, we had the share user group. So, this was part of IBM way

02:51.000 --> 03:04.000
back then, and people were starting to share source codes, and this is how these mindsets of sharing

03:04.000 --> 03:12.000
codes, and there was no Open Source back then. There was no free software back then, but these mindsets

03:12.000 --> 03:22.000
was already there. This is akin to the human. They always shared knowledge, and so they started

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
sharing codes with the share user group, and later we can see here that this is a funny one.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
If anyone remember the Open Letter to Hobbits, so Bill Gates was not very keen to people sharing

03:37.000 --> 03:51.000
his codes, and he was very angry about that. So, everyone shared their codes before, and with Bill Gates

03:51.000 --> 04:01.000
coming and other companies, they started making the source codes proprietary, and looking at that,

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
Richard Stallman, he didn't like it. A lot of developers didn't like this, and they created a movement

04:08.000 --> 04:18.000
to go back to how it was before, about sharing knowledge, about sharing codes, about just making

04:18.000 --> 04:35.000
progress, and so he started GNU in 1983. 1985, he founded the Free Software Foundation, and also

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
the next year, the definition of free software, so I'm going to go over this, and this is really

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
important, probably most of you know, but it's always good to repeat this. So, the definition

04:47.000 --> 04:55.000
of free software is the freedom to run the program as you wish. That's the definition zero.

04:55.000 --> 05:04.000
One, the freedom to study how the program works and change it. Number two, the freedom to redistribute

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
copies to your neighbors, and the third one, the freedom to distribute copies of modified

05:11.000 --> 05:20.000
versions to others. So, these are the basics. This is the basic definition of free software.

05:20.000 --> 05:29.000
In 89, there was created the GPL. A lot of people use GPL still today. It's one of the main

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
licenses. We have the software in public interest. This was very important for Debian projects,

05:35.000 --> 05:45.000
and as you see in the open source timeline, the Debian projects shares a lot of similarities

05:45.000 --> 05:53.000
with the OSI, because Bruce Perlens was there, and he was fundamental on that. So, we have

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
the software freedom conservancy that was created in 2006. The GPL version three released in

06:01.000 --> 06:08.000
2007, and that's the timeline for the free software. Of course, this is an overview. If

06:08.000 --> 06:18.000
I miss something, please, this is available on GitHub, and you can propose a milestone to be

06:18.000 --> 06:36.000
added. Now, let's go back and go to the open source timeline. So, open source is not actually

06:36.000 --> 06:45.000
something that came out of nowhere. It has always been inspired by the free software

06:45.000 --> 06:53.000
movements, and those two are not different. The open source is a continuation of the free

06:53.000 --> 07:03.000
software movements. So, one of the key books that was very relevant at the time was the

07:03.000 --> 07:12.000
Cathedral and the Bazaar that was published by Eric Raymond, and this book compared how

07:12.000 --> 07:22.000
software was developed on systems like Linux, which was very chaotic sometimes, but it worked,

07:22.000 --> 07:34.000
and how it was developed in proprietary software. It was a very, it was a waterfall model, and

07:34.000 --> 07:43.000
it was comparing those two models and explaining how building together in this distributed

07:43.000 --> 07:54.000
manner still works, even for complex systems like Linux or Sand Mayo. So, this book inspired

07:54.000 --> 08:05.000
a Netscape to make it open source. They wanted to attract global developers to help with their

08:05.000 --> 08:16.000
software. And finally, Christine Peterson, she created the open source label. So, this is

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
really interesting to highlight. How many of you knew that a woman was responsible for

08:22.000 --> 08:31.000
coining the term open source? Please raise your hands. You see, I only saw a few hands raised,

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
and this is really important. The reason why we're here today talking about open source is

08:37.000 --> 08:46.000
because of a woman, so that's really special. And so, Christine, she wanted to, the reason why

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
she created the label open source is that she wanted to make it really friendly for business to

08:51.000 --> 09:01.000
realize the importance of free software. But the free software label was not very well

09:01.000 --> 09:09.000
accepted. It was kind of, it didn't work out, but with the open source label, it was really

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
magical, and everything just went really well. So, the open source initiative was founded in

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
February with Eric Raymond and Bruce Perence from the Debian Project. The definition was

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
created based on the Debian free software guidelines. So, as you can see, the Debian

09:31.000 --> 09:42.000
Project and the OSI has a very strong relationship since the very beginning. We had the open

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
source summits happening that year. As you can see, Tim O'Reilly, he started promoting this as

09:49.000 --> 09:57.000
well, a very good marketing just from the beginning, with a lot of people, like Linus from

09:57.000 --> 10:04.000
the Linux, Larry Wall from Pearl, Brian from Apache, Eric from Sand Mail, Guido from

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
Python. So, a lot of very, very well-known developers got together to promote open source and

10:12.000 --> 10:23.000
this new label. Of course, not everyone was happy about this popularity of open source,

10:23.000 --> 10:31.000
and one example is Microsoft. So, they started spreading a lot of fuzz, and we have the famous

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
Halloween documents as well that was leaked, and they really wanted, they had a strategy

10:38.000 --> 10:46.000
to kill open source and free software, which was the idea of, extends the software and

10:46.000 --> 10:57.000
create proprietary things that they wouldn't share back and to break open source. And they

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
really did try to kill open source at the beginning. So, in 1999, we had the OSI lessons list,

11:05.000 --> 11:19.000
and the OSI logo, the keyhole, was created as well in 1999, and it's this one here.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
At the time, there were a lot of lessons that were coming out, and this was challenging

11:26.000 --> 11:33.000
from a legal perspective, because this created a lot of confusion. So, one of the very important

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
roles from the OSI was an attempt to bring all those lessons together, to see which ones

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
were compatible or not, and to highlight only the main ones, so we wouldn't have a proliferation

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
of several lessons, which would be just very confusing. So, the main ones, the most popular

11:52.000 --> 12:01.000
ones, are the Apache, the BST, the GPL, and MIT, and they're still very popular today.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
And five years ago, while we were celebrating the 20 years of open source, I'm not sure

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
if you remember the Commons clause and other lessons that came at that year, they were

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
trying to really say, hey, we're open source, but you can't share this, you can't distribute

12:22.000 --> 12:30.000
this. So, this is a case of open source, it's not really open source, and the OSI board

12:30.000 --> 12:37.000
and everyone involved, while we were celebrating the anniversary, we were really fighting to

12:37.000 --> 12:47.000
defend the open source definition, and I think we have succeeded. So, I attempted to give

12:47.000 --> 12:58.000
you an overview of the history of free software and of open source, and it's not just that.

12:58.000 --> 13:07.000
This was inspired, and has inspired a lot of movements. We have the free culture movements

13:07.000 --> 13:14.000
as well, highlighted by the Wikipedia. Wikipedia is about sharing knowledge, about sharing contents,

13:14.000 --> 13:26.000
about creating encyclopedia that everyone can help and everyone can edit.

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
We can also discuss the role of open source in business, and how this has helped. So,

13:33.000 --> 13:43.000
this is a huge timeline. Susie, for example, is a very important company here in Germany,

13:43.000 --> 13:54.000
and it was founded in 1992. Red Hat is celebrating 30 years this year, and it was an example

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
that you can actually create a billion-dollar business using only free and open source

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
software. So, this was really important, and if you want to check out, there are so many

14:04.000 --> 14:15.000
stories here. So, we have Susie, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Droids. I think it's important

14:15.000 --> 14:24.000
to highlight also Automatic, the company behind WordPress. So, today we have several people

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
who use WordPress and develop WordPress and provide services using free and open source

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
software, and there's a whole bunch of examples here on this timeline. If you want to check

14:37.000 --> 14:57.000
out, that's great. We also have open governments, how open source has influenced how governments

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
are run, trying to make the government as transparent as possible to publish those

15:03.000 --> 15:13.000
documents and to allow citizens to help with the city, with the states, with the country,

15:13.000 --> 15:21.000
by really looking and making the government more transparent and more engaging. Open

15:21.000 --> 15:30.000
knowledge as well. So, the Internet Archive is trying to create a collection of everything

15:30.000 --> 15:38.000
digital, making books, digital games, music, and there's a lot of movements around open

15:38.000 --> 15:47.000
knowledge as well. We have open hardware as well, which is essential. How open source

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
and free software has influenced open education as well. We have OERs, which allows people

15:53.000 --> 16:02.000
to share contents around education. The open web, this is, of course, one of the main ones.

16:02.000 --> 16:12.000
We follow an open web, it's very challenging. So, the web has to be open, right? Linux,

16:12.000 --> 16:20.000
of course, one of the main applications. Free software, we already saw this timeline.

16:20.000 --> 16:28.000
The importance of open access and open science and having reproducible science, right? And

16:28.000 --> 16:39.000
lastly, open data, the importance of open data. Especially right now, with AI, we have

16:39.000 --> 16:48.000
to have open data sets to help this and for people to collaborate. So, this is about the

16:48.000 --> 16:57.000
past. Now, we're going to jump to the future. And I'm just going to highlight a few projects

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
which I'm really interested in. And I think this is the future of open source. Of course,

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
there are many other areas of interest, but we have the software build materials. This

17:09.000 --> 17:19.000
was especially due to the vulnerability that has been happening recently. And the White House

17:19.000 --> 17:27.000
in the US, they brought everyone together to discuss the role of open source in business

17:27.000 --> 17:34.000
and in government and everywhere. And how it's important for us to have mechanisms that

17:34.000 --> 17:41.000
can protect those software. So, one of them is software build materials. And this is being

17:41.000 --> 17:49.000
championed by the open SSF and other organizations. This is really important. And basically, as

17:49.000 --> 17:57.000
bombs, they allow developers to track the penises and vulnerabilities in software packages to

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
make sure that they are reliable. We also have SiegStore. And SiegStore is really important to

18:04.000 --> 18:11.000
make sure they have a package that is authentic. So, it allows developers to assign those packages.

18:11.000 --> 18:20.000
And so, nobody can tamper or compromise those packages. We finally have WebAssembly as well,

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
which is coming along. So, there's WebAssembly on the browser side, but there's also WebAssembly

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
on the server side, which is gaining a lot of importance. And one of the reasons why WebAssembly

18:31.000 --> 18:42.000
is important is because of portability, security, and also performance. And WebAssembly has a huge

18:42.000 --> 18:52.000
potential to allow open source to grow. Something that I'm really keen to working with as well

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
with Confidential Computing. We have a dev room that's happening here at FOSDOM around

18:58.000 --> 19:05.000
Confidential Computing. And Confidential Computing is about encrypting data in use, in memory,

19:05.000 --> 19:13.000
in the CPU. So, this will impact how we use the cloud today. When we use the cloud, there are

19:13.000 --> 19:21.000
a lot of security issues. And by using Confidential Computing, we allow this to be more secure.

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
Finally, regarding AI, we have Bloom. So, people here probably have heard of Shats GPT, but

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
that's not open source. And one of the issues of not being open source is that we don't

19:35.000 --> 19:43.000
allow researchers or anyone, any individual to look into the algorithm or look into the

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
models, the data sets. And Bloom is an attempt to do that. It's an European project, mostly,

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
but it has researchers from all over the world as well, attempting to create something on

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
open source AI. And this is really worth checking as well. And finally, we also have Stable

20:04.000 --> 20:14.000
Diffusion. This is a project, a deep learning project that you can enter a field description

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
and it will generate an image for you. Again, the reason why it's important for you to have

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
something that's open is because you want to see what are the models, what are the data sets,

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
and research around that. And we want to have control over this. So, this, for me, is the

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
future of open source, some really interesting projects. And now I'm going to talk about the

20:38.000 --> 20:47.000
presence of open source. So, this is the moment for you to celebrate open source. And I really

20:47.000 --> 20:57.000
want you to celebrate here at FOSM. So, it's who here came alone? You don't have a colleague.

20:57.000 --> 21:04.000
Please raise your hands. Did you come with a friend or are you alone? Okay, we have quite a few

21:04.000 --> 21:11.000
hands. So, go to someone by your side and ask, what's your open source journey? How did you

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
get started with open source? Try to break the ice and share those stories. What are you

21:17.000 --> 21:23.000
interested in? What's the future of open source for you? What are the projects that you're

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
working on? So, celebrate here at FOSM together with your colleagues. I would also like to

21:29.000 --> 21:36.000
invite you to go to the State of OpenCon. This is a conference that's happening right after

21:36.000 --> 21:45.000
FOSM in London. And there are 200 free tickets. If you want to attend this conference, usually the

21:45.000 --> 21:54.000
ticket is 199 pounds. But if you go to the table of Open UK here at FOSM, you can get a free

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
ticket. And the conference is going to be very close to FOSM and it's nearby. You can take the

22:01.000 --> 22:09.000
train and be there and just celebrate the 25 years of open source. And also, celebrate the

22:09.000 --> 22:16.000
open source by creating your own personal timeline. You can fork this timeline and you can

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
share your story. Also, you can share the story of your projects. If you don't have an open

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
source project, you can look at other projects and create a story about your projects. Organize a

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
party at your organization, at your company, bring some cupcakes and share those photos with the

22:38.000 --> 22:47.000
OSI. We'll be sharing that with others as well. So, you can share this. You can either tag the OSI

22:47.000 --> 22:57.000
on Twitter, but preferably on Macedon as well. So, this one here is a nice picture of a celebration

22:57.000 --> 23:05.000
in Japan, where they were celebrating the 20 years of open source. So, they just created, they

23:05.000 --> 23:15.000
have a cake from the tux and they just shared the photos and the OSI shared those again. And

23:15.000 --> 23:23.000
finally, I want to invite the OSI board of directors here for a special announcement to

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
celebrate the 25 years of open source. And so, thank you, everyone, and Jugos University.

23:30.000 --> 23:45.000
Well, thank you. Thank you so much, Nick, for sharing this opportunity. Hello, everyone. I'm

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
Stefano Maffulio. I'm the executive director of the open source initiative. And it's a privilege to

23:50.000 --> 24:01.000
be here to celebrate 25 years in February 1998. The open source initiative has been focusing a lot

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
in shaping with the open source definition. We've been shaping the conversations around

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
technology for the past 20 years. And the definition itself, the community that we have

24:14.000 --> 24:20.000
created has influenced every technology that we have seen from the start of the internet,

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
cryptography, content right management, the software patents debate. We've been at the

24:25.000 --> 24:32.000
center of everything that happened in technology in our society. But this is not about only

24:32.000 --> 24:39.000
talking about the past. We are the stewards of the open source definition. As an organization,

24:39.000 --> 24:48.000
we have maintained it for the community. And the community itself changes all the time. The

24:48.000 --> 24:55.000
technology also changes. And we have to pay attention to these changes in order to adapt.

24:55.000 --> 25:05.000
In the past year, the organization has been looking at AI and how the new technology is

25:05.000 --> 25:13.000
making different from what we've seen before. This week and the next weeks, we're going to

25:13.000 --> 25:21.000
have a few announcements. We're going to publish a report of the findings of the deep dive on

25:21.000 --> 25:28.000
AI that we've done last year where we have interviewed experts in many different fields

25:28.000 --> 25:37.000
on academia, practitioners of AI, developers, hackers, corporations doing artificial

25:37.000 --> 25:45.000
intelligence, civil society, politicians, policymakers. And we have collected all the

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
thoughts, all the findings into one document that you can look at. And I can share with

25:50.000 --> 25:57.000
you today just the very, the most important things that I've learned from this experience.

25:57.000 --> 26:05.000
One is that artificial intelligence and AI systems, machine learning, reinforcement

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
learning, all these new modern systems, they require a huge amount of data. And that is

26:11.000 --> 26:19.000
interesting to me because it clashes a lot with the thoughts that we already had with

26:19.000 --> 26:25.000
privacy, for example. Collecting large amounts of data requires, to some extent, making

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
compromises about privacy and rights of the authors. Like the concept of copyright that

26:31.000 --> 26:38.000
we always thought of, something that I've created, I have rights on. There is a new

26:38.000 --> 26:47.000
right in town that is also being regulated. We have the right to data mining, which is

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
fairly new. And we have to try to find the strike a balance between these new rights,

26:52.000 --> 27:00.000
personal rights, authors rights, and availability of data because the other side of the

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
spectrum is that large amounts of data can be amassed with large amounts of money and

27:04.000 --> 27:11.000
resources. So hackers may not have the availability of creating suitable AI systems if we put

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
too many restrictions on data mining. That's one of the aspects that is going to be

27:17.000 --> 27:25.000
highlighted in the report. The second one is that the legal systems, or actually

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
policymakers, are extremely interested in regulating this new field because it comes

27:31.000 --> 27:39.000
with, it's extremely powerful. The systems we've seen running are very powerful and they

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
can create damage. Therefore, policymakers are paying attention and they want to

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
regulate it. We need to find a balance between having too much regulation and allowing

27:50.000 --> 27:57.000
innovation. And the community needs to pay attention to this as it's happening. The

27:57.000 --> 28:10.000
third and last piece in this, it's very tip of the iceberg is that the practitioners

28:10.000 --> 28:19.000
of AI, developers of AI systems, researchers, professors, the academia levels are very

28:19.000 --> 28:27.000
aware of the ethical aspects, the use of AI systems. They are aware of the fact that

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
they can be misused and they can create really bad damages to people and therefore

28:32.000 --> 28:39.000
they are thinking very hard about regulating the use of systems. This is something

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
that the open source community has never really paid attention to. It's always

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
allowed for very freely use of software. It's part of the open source definition,

28:51.000 --> 28:59.000
part of the free software definition, that you cannot stop, you cannot regulate

28:59.000 --> 29:07.000
the use. But AI practitioners seem to be quite interested in doing just the opposite.

29:07.000 --> 29:13.000
So we have to help them and talk to them a lot to understand their needs and to find

29:13.000 --> 29:20.000
with them social norms, social rules that allow for collaboration that limit the amount

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
of damages that AI systems can do at the same time allow for the collaboration to

29:25.000 --> 29:32.000
happen in a frictionless and permissionless way. So with that said, I really recommend

29:32.000 --> 29:39.000
you to follow deepdive.opensource.org, go and listen to the podcasts if you have

29:39.000 --> 29:47.000
not heard them already, listen to them. And we have also the report coming up so

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
you will be notified when it comes out. We have two more announcements to make.

29:54.000 --> 30:04.000
One, we are reviewing the process that reviews the licenses. And we're going to

30:04.000 --> 30:10.000
have a conversation in the legal dev room later today at one o'clock. And we also

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
have an announcement to make for which Deb, our director of policy, will talk more

30:17.000 --> 30:26.000
about. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks again, Nick. I'm going to do a

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
three-minute announcement. So I'm Deb Bryant. I'm policy director for the U.S.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
and I have also been involved with the United Nations over the last couple of

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
years helping them as they were developing registry for digital public goods.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
Well, I'm very excited. You're the first to know, so you can socialize this, that

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
OSI is joining as an official member of the digital public goods alliance.

30:51.000 --> 30:59.000
The DGBA is the initiative that has created a strategy to support the U.N.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
sustainable goals through the use of open source software and open infrastructure.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
If you're around tomorrow, there's a dev room that the foundation for public

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
code and the digital public goods alliance are co-hosting. They also have a stand

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
here so you can hear more about it. But as a public charity, we think it's important

31:18.000 --> 31:24.000
for OSI to support those goals. We're very excited that there's a recognition of

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
the strong ingredient of open source and creating a more equitable world.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
So thanks for letting us share that here. And I'm going to hand it back to Nick

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
to wrap up the session. Thanks, everybody.

31:33.000 --> 31:45.000
All right. And to conclude, every celebration, every birthday needs sweets and desserts.

31:45.000 --> 31:58.000
So we have a box here of Belgian chocolates. Of course. And stickers.

31:58.000 --> 32:04.000
There are some special stickers from the OSI. So please pass it around and enjoy it.

32:04.000 --> 32:29.000
Thank you.
