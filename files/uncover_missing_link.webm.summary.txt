In this talk at the FOSDEM conference, Charles discusses the potential benefits of collaboration between the open source and standards communities. He explains that standards are important for interoperability and avoiding vendor lock-in, but they can take a long time to develop. On the other hand, open source projects can drive rapid innovation, but integrating different open source projects can be challenging. Charles suggests that by bringing together the speed and collaborative spirit of open source with the rigor and interoperability of standards, both communities can benefit. He gives examples of how the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is working on integrating open source and standards through initiatives like GitHub integration and IETF hackathons. Charles also proposes creating a systematic linkage between code and standards to make it easier to find and use code related to standards. He encourages others to contribute to this linkage and collaborate between the two communities to make standards more consumable by developers and open source projects more compatible with industry standards.
