{"text": " Thanks, everybody, for coming. So yeah, I am not from the corporation, I'm from the Mozilla Foundation. And so besides being the non-profit behind the Firefox browser, we do a lot of other cool stuff. And so for those of you not familiar with it, I do want to go briefly over that. So the Mozilla Foundation, of course, like the corporation, is mission-driven and believes that the internet should be open, accessible, free-fair. And so at the Foundation side, we do a lot of interesting research, a lot of it into social media, and a lot of it related to kind of accountability and transparency of social media, the kind of the systemic problems that we see on a lot of the web. So some of you might have even participated in some of our research through, for instance, for Greta's reporter, through data donations from lots of people, we were able to actually investigate YouTube's algorithm in a way that there are a lot of us to get a view of it from the outside, right, because YouTube is not necessarily handing over that information right now. We've also done, we do policy work around kind of legislative files that either have great potential for our mission or might affect our mission in certain ways. You might have also followed some of this work over the years. We do advocacy and campaigning. And then we publish every year an internet health report. And so this year's internet health report is really worth checking out because it's actually in the form of a podcast. So you can find that and listen to those episodes. And Moz Fest also is taking place online in hubs in March. And then it will take place physically in a couple of different locations in June, but I would definitely encourage you to attend some of those sessions happening. Okay, but I'm going to talk to you about something very specific today. And I'm curious how many people here have actually heard of the Digital Services Act. Just raise your hand if you've heard of it. Okay, great. So it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. Great. And as I'm going to go through really an overview of the Digital Services Act and particularly the obligations to a certain kind of actor, this is, yeah, this is an ongoing conversation. So I'm really curious in your thoughts as well about this. So I'm going to talk about why did the EU decide to make a Digital Services Act? What is roughly in this? And what are the next steps where are we in the process? Because while the Digital Services Act is agreed and is applied, it's enforced, sorry, it's not actually been applied to the services yet. We have to wait until the end of the year and until next year, actually. So first of all, why create a Digital Services Act? So the DSA is really designed to update the e-commerce rules, which are now almost two decades old. So it really takes that for the internet stack. And then it adds on to that, looking at kind of the way that the web has changed today. As we know in the last 20 years, sort of the handful of large companies have essentially taken over the web. And so at the same time, there are many countries that are trying to address social media and web policy. And the idea is that the EU can do this in a harmonized way, rather than having one law in one country and one law in another. We kind of make a harmonized playing field, which is then easier for providers as well as for the end user. And the DSA should really be seen also in conversation with the Digital Markets Act, which is probably really interesting to many of you here. And these really are two sides of a coin in a sense, and they're both different ways of addressing a problem of fairness. So the Digital Markets Act is really intervening in saying, OK, there are certain gatekeepers that have actually used their market power in an unfair way. And we need to update our competition law in certain ways. And then sort of a macro level fairness, fairness between different services. And then you have the Digital Services Act, which is fairness in a micro sense. It's fairness between a service provider and the end user. Where does that service deliver to the end user in an illegible way? Is it transparent? Is it accountable for the service that it's ultimately giving them? And it tries to kind of raise the bar instead of high bar when it comes to fairness towards end users. So two sides of the coin. Yes, what is it? What is the Digital Services Act? What does it do? Well, first of all, who does it apply to? As I mentioned, it's really taken the e-commerce directive. So for the internet stack, it's essentially moving that across. So that it categorizes the services that it applies to these four different categories. And the most interesting, the most important obligations are on this new category that it creates, which is very large online platforms and very large online search engines, of which there is one, maybe two. And also online platforms themselves, and the idea of an online platform being different than a hosting service, is that it's disseminating user-generated content publicly. But I'm really going to be focused on this middle blue block. So it comes up with this new term, which is a VLOP. Some people say VLOP. I like to say VLOP. It's really up to you. But the idea is that a VLOP is a platform that is serving over 10% of the EU population, that it has a systemic role in our information ecosystem, and therefore it deserves to have some corresponding responsibilities. So it relates to 45 million active monthly users. You might ask, what is an active monthly user? It is a good question. And platforms are in the process of counting this up right now. And of course, there are going to be different ways that this can be counted. The commission has provided some guidelines around this. There's still some ambiguity. And also, very large online search engines doesn't fit so beautifully into the DSA structure. This was added by the council, but the idea is that search engines that also have the same threshold also should be accountable in the same kinds of ways. So the DSA takes an asymmetric structure. That's usually not a difficult word for me. So the idea is that the larger you are, the more obligations that you have. And there are key exemptions for small and micro enterprises. So this is important to maybe a small, fediverse actor. There are exemptions if you have only a certain number of employees or only a certain revenue. But for the other ones, there are real obligations and there are the possibility of fines. So the DSA is a thing to be taken seriously. And this gives a kind of outline of the different obligations that I can go over more so specifically for the very largest online platforms. So the DSA, it doesn't say what is illegal. What is illegal is defined by EU member states and by EU law. And the DSA really tries to take a systemic approach. It's not trying to kind of whack a mole, take down pieces of illegal content because we know, we've been in this space for a while, we know it doesn't really work that way. I used to work on disinformation. It's not about a single piece of content. It's about the way that the service is providing narratives and amplifying certain things. But it's really structural. And so the DSA is really trying to take the systemic approach and asks each very large online platform to go and say, what are your systemic risks? Do they relate to certain kind of online violence that your service might be perpetuating? They relate to privacy. So and the platform then has to address that and actually propose their own ways of addressing that systemic risk. It also does have some very clear ideas though about how platforms should be addressing their systemic risks. For instance, they have to have advertising libraries where researchers can go through, actually anyone can go through it and look at the archive of what has been published as promotional content. Platforms that are over the threshold have to have a recommendation algorithm that is not based on user profiling onto the definition of the GDPR. So experts in GDPR might say, maybe we can still have a recommender system that's using some kind of engagement type of data. But the idea is that you have to have a really viable alternative. There are rules about online interface and design. So the idea that you shouldn't have deceptive patterns that are tricking you into maybe making decisions online that you wouldn't normally take. Data access for vetative researchers, it's critically important. We know this at the Mozilla Foundation having researched very large online platforms ourselves. It's very difficult to know sometimes what's going on inside the platform. So the idea is that eventually there will be infrastructure for the largest platforms to actually share certain data sets related to their systemic risks with vetive researchers. This is a very long process of building up this infrastructure, making sure that it has really clear safeguards. But this is really important and for those of you who read the news that Twitter is going to get rid of its free API, this is a really critical problem is how are we going to continue to hold platforms to account if we don't understand what's really happening inside of them. So many caveats on this data access regime, it really is about systemic risks. It really is about compliance and it is for researchers. But this is a really, really important thing that's going to change over the next couple of years. Codes of conduct, so like the Code of Practice on Disinformation, which now joins in the DSA, there will be also codes of conduct related to accessibility and related to other kind of key areas where platforms and companies might be able to come together and decide for themselves to an extent what are important measures they can take and then that's backed up through the rest of the regulatory framework. And then crisis response, which we can maybe talk about in the Q&A. But so what are the next steps? Where are we in this legislative process or now it's the implementation process, right? We have the regulation now. But there's a lot of things that are yet to be determined. So yeah, we've had, the draft was released in 2020, it's been a couple of years working on it with the institutions and now we are coming on a very important moment, which is so it's in force, but who does it apply to? And so on February 17th, so mark your calendars, platforms that are likely very large online platforms are very large online search engines are supposed to notify the European Commission of this. But this is actually something kind of funny happened here, which is that it's not written in the DSA exactly how the platforms or how the commission will find out which platforms are in it. So platforms are told to put this number on somewhere on their interface. So the commission might have to go and check a lot of platforms interfaces. They've been encouraged platforms have been encouraged to actually email the commission. There's an email address that they can use. But if some of you have some free time the next couple of weeks and want to find out if platforms are publishing their numbers on their interface, please do. That would be great. So yes, we'll see what happens on February 17th. And then so for the largest online platforms, the DSA will actually apply to them already at the end of actually midway through this year in July. And then for the rest of the stack and for the smaller online platforms, it won't apply until 2024. So we have a bit of time. And this time is because there's a lot of kind of secondary legislation, codes of conduct, voluntary standards, a lot of the real kind of details of the DSA are actually yet to be really specified and spelled out. And that process is what's happening now. And that's why it's great that you guys are in this room and maybe you're interested in some of these details, which are in some cases really not details at all. They're very, very important. Yes, so one of these things is the designation of the very large online platforms. One of them is the data access regime. We have a secondary delegated act that will actually entail what is the data access regime. Auditing requirements, I think I might have skipped that, but the very large online platforms and search engines have to submit themselves to an annual audit. They pay for this audit, but they have to be submitted to this audit. And this audit is all of their due diligence obligations, the massive kind of audit. And the kind of details of what this auditing regime will look like are actually being elaborated now in a delegated act, so that's really important. And we'll have a draft of that delegated act after that you can look at and give feedback on that should appear in the next couple of weeks towards the end of the month. Yes, and then guidelines, various voluntary standards will come out on a lot of different elements of the GSA. And right now, regulators are really getting prepared. They have a massive amount of work to do. The European Commission for the first time is going to become a regulator, actually. This was not the case with GDPR, right? It was really the member states that were regulating the GSA now for the largest online platforms, the Commission will be overseeing them. But of course, everyone else is going to be overseeing by regulators in their member states, so all EU countries are in the process of designating something called the digital services coordinator that will be responsible for overseeing the compliance of regulation in that member state. And a lot of online, very large online platforms are based in Ireland, right? And so that means that the eventual Irish digital service coordinator will have quite an important role, probably not as important as it had in the GDPR towards data protection issues, but still a very important role. And the European Commission has recently actually opened up an entirely new institution, which is the European Center for Algorithmic Transparency, ECAST. It has offices in Brussels, in Italy and in Spain, and they're going to be really serving as kind of an additional kind of technical support to the Commission to understand some of the research challenges that it has in front of it. And that's where I'm going to close. As usual, I talk fast, so I have a little bit of time, but that's okay. And if you have questions, yeah, I'm on Mastodon, I'm also on Twitter, but, and this is my, but this feels like a Mastodon crowd, so yeah. The hand went up really fast, yeah. Yeah, right there. Thank you very much. We also have a question in Matrix. Say, question for the DSA, where does the platform have to publish, communicate their monthly active users? Yeah, that's a good question, right? So they're supposed to put it on their, on their interface, I don't really know what that means. But they're supposed to put it on their interface, but they should also email the European Commission. So if that question is being asked by a very large online platform, you should email the Commission. Hello, thank you for the communication. I was waiting to know more about the law in itself. Recently, there have been a condemnation of Facebook and the US has been in lawsuit between LinkedIn and a small company about web scrapping. And web scrapping right now is, is, is the way for us, for developer and the developer open source developers, to access to the data on this platform because they are the only one that can have the monopoly, but the clear they have the monopoly on it yet the regulation actually is harsh. It could, it could be interpreted as forbidding data scrapping in somehow that the point of this company that's saying that it's forbidden. I wanted to know if they, this new law push, push obligation requirements for the, for the company for this block to have public APIs or at least not to block application want to, to make the content free. Yeah. I'm not sure is that clear because I'm not, I'm not native English. No, that was really clear. So questions about web scraping and how the DSA will block or, or help researchers essentially study the large online platforms. I can't respond to web scraping specifically. It's a really important question, right? But as to the kind of the ability of the DSA to encourage and facilitate research and especially through APIs, it will encourage, so for the largest online platforms again, it will require them to share data. It doesn't exactly say how we'll do this. It talks about interfaces, right? And this is again to be elaborated through the delegated act. So that your question really is going to be answered over the next, you know, year and a half or so. But specifically the platforms will have to, to share data and have to allow research. It won't necessarily be with everyone. There are clarifications about what is a vetted researcher, but it will, and we have this already in the text, at least in the article on, on data access, there are tiers. So for a tier of data, which is quote unquote manifestly made public, so we can think about if we think about Facebook, it's like a public page, that data should be available through actually an interface. It's essentially trying to mandate a kind of crowd tangle. So this isn't everything that necessarily we want to see, and it's also, this has to also itself still be elaborated, but the GSA is trying to encourage this kind of research. Speaking of mastodon, so if, like how does this definition of very large online platform come when it comes to like federated services? Like if mastodon grows to like, I don't know, hundreds of million of users and all the European instances together hit this 10% like point of numbers of users, but none of them individually actually do this. Like is there any specification for this and the regulation? Yeah, so this should be taken as legal advice for people who run mastodon servers. This I can tell you my understanding, and then I can say that the GSA was really not designed to try to penalize the Fediverse. The GSA is trying to encourage the Fediverse, it's trying to look at platforms that are largely profit driven, right? But in the Fediverse, it would be treated, I'm fairly, according to my understanding, as an individual server would be a platform, and so if you had one individual server that finally reached the threshold of 45 million active monthly users, which I think we're very, very far from, then there might be some obligations, but at that point they have a lot of other problems, I think if you're running a server that's that big. Otherwise it would be, yeah, I think we're really going to be looking at small micro platforms there. As far as I understood, the GSA applies to organizations and companies, right? Are you aware of there's any initiative to do something similar when it comes to the profession of software engineering? Because you could argue that people who build platforms also share the responsibility and the safety of the platforms. That's such a, I really like that question. The question is there, so the GSA is largely targeting companies, right, over platforms, but what about applying to software engineers as such? I mean, it's challenging, this is, I'm speaking really my personal opinion here, but to hold a person responsible for their company, or the thing that they're providing, that's difficult, but I think as far as there's some really interesting articles in the GSA that will be interesting to see how companies interpret them and how individuals interpret them, like on the interface design, I think this is really up to designers to do a really great and transparent job on that. So yeah, I don't think that, I mean, it's difficult to have regulation applied to employees, right, that would be tricky, but it's an interesting question. There, any other questions? So specifically, what it comes down to in the end are the details, right? So how's the Mozilla Foundation, and people in general, influence in these details that are nothing about that, in the end also, like, what's the case? So I didn't hear the second part. What were the examples at the end that you mentioned? The question is, what about the details, which are really yet to come, including also court decisions? Yeah, I think there are going to be a lot of civil society organizations that are going to engage probably in strategic litigation. I think that would be a huge component of the next couple of years. As for the Mozilla Foundation, we're really interested in the implementation phase, right? The areas that the commission has very much asked for help on certain things, that, you know, they're consulting with stakeholders, there are public processes, the Delegated Act, where they publish them and they want feedback. So really following those opportunities, and I think a lot of civil society actors are as well. And then there is a lot of, these codes of conduct, I think, are really interesting, and the voluntary standards where organizations and civil society actors can come together and add some details. So the research community has a huge role, I think, to play. So yeah, definitely Mozilla and definitely a lot of other actors are engaging, but there's so many opportunities to do that. So if you're interested in them, you can send me an email, actually. Is there any interaction between GDPR and DSA? There is, yeah. So in a couple of, I mean GDPR always applies, but it's sort of a bedrock for a lot of these things, but there are a couple of really interesting articles where they have overlap. So for instance, the provision that very large online, sorry, the question was the relationship between GDPR and DSA, and I'm not going to give you a holistic answer on that at all, you would ask the specialist, but I can tell you the provisions that I'm really interested in that overlap. So one of them is on the requirement for a very large online platform to have a recommender system not based on profiling. This is typically an area where they have overlap because profiling is understood under the GDPR. So it'll be really important to see how this is actually understood and how platforms will implement that and then how regulators will also see their responsibility to ensure that that's enforced. And that's one area, and there are a few other articles where they're also that kind of similar overlap. We have a question in matrix. Do you fear any backfire action from companies to happen, like the GDPR created the pop-up hell of consent? Okay, the question is about backfire. Well, technically it wasn't GDPR, it was the ePrivacy Directive. It's a combination of the two that's responsible for cookie banners, but it is a really good question. And this is where I think it's actually really important to be clear about what is compliance to the letter of the regulation and what is meaningful compliance for the actual end user whose experience you want to help, right? So it's possible that companies might take the regulation and in their kind of design of their new obligations make something really annoying for users to get them to not want to do it. For instance, take this example again of the alternate recommender system. You could hide it behind eight clicks and you could make it change back the next morning. You know, you could make it somehow like really boring. I don't know, but there are ways that you could make it unattractive, but it's still comply. And so I think it's important that companies decide to comply in a way that's also appealing and also fair, because I don't think that cookie banners are really complying with GDPR privacy in a way that is really fair. We are a bit out of time. Okay, just ask a quick question. So just related to that, especially in the context of dark patterns which is coded after GDPR because how you basically never know what you're thinking there is a normal amount of dark patterns that appear because of GDPR because now people or companies are trying to make it impossible for the user to know what is consensual or not. And so it was clearly not too easy to regulate that since everyone is doing it. So how would the GSA be different? How can the GSA then regulate it in a way that companies don't just play around? Yeah, the question is about dark patterns or deceptive design and especially after GDPR. So there is a specific article in the GSA Article 25 that looks at online interface. So it's not looking at any kind of patterns, but it's looking at online interface design and it's obliging platforms to design their interface in a way that is not deceptive and doesn't leave the user down a path they wouldn't intend. So very much the authors of the GSA are trying to not have that happen again through this one article. However, the article isn't as strong as it could be and so a lot of civil study advocates that were pushing for it to be stronger didn't get everything they wanted. That said, I see this as being really, really important and I think if platforms do look at this article and fully comply we shouldn't have some of these dark pattern issues. But this, yeah, this is one of those details that will yet to be seen and I think there's going to be a lot of pressure on this one provision and I hope it can withstand that pressure. Thank you very much. We don't have time for more questions, but feel free to pop them in the matrix room and thank you very much.
