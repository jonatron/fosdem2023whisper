{"text": " We've seen all the developments, we've seen Gaffy light is coming, but also what will happen with the main Gaffy, with the main Gaffy code base. So, thanks a lot for coming and for having us and enjoy the talk. So hello everyone, Gaffy is a network analysis and visualization software that is I think primarily used in teaching, it's Java based and it's very visual. I had assumed wrongly that most of you would have known what it is, but basically you can interact with the network nodes and edges visually and it's really a good entry point into say network science, it's used in teaching and I would say it's quite field diagnostic, it's not dedicated to any industry, it's not for the social science only, it's not for biology, it's not for just visualizing a graph database output, it's just any graph, but it's kind of for beginners. And it's been existing for more than 10 years now, it's pretty popular and Matthew and I are basically the two fathers of that tool, he's really the architect of the code and I'm more the guy who assures the continuity of the project and I had designed some algorithms and the user experience if you will. And this is a community oriented talk, we'll talk about the code base a little bit but it's also about what's around, hence the code base and the rest. So Gaffy has basically been unfinished forever like so many products we know, that's why the version number is below one and it's also because you know there is no big entity funding Gaffy, it's like our free time, so we push it as much as we can when we can, but there is always something missing and basically we have known for a very long time that we want to finish it basically but we're not there yet and we patch it and we keep it working but it doesn't mean we do finish it. So for instance, we do not have all the features we would like to have that would make a coherent or consistent whole like a set of features that go well together and we also want it to be reliable enough and efficient enough that it can live for a longer life, right? So we want to set goals and fulfill these goals. So basically the idea is that when we get there, that's when we are going to call the version 1.0, right? Because of course the project is going to work, live and we're going to work on it after that and we're also going to work on it before that. So the 1.0 is today's Gaffy if you know it but finished in that sense. Now the question is about what does that entail and that's what we want to talk about. And the way I'm going to start is by explaining how we think of the roadmap to version 1.0. And basically, so there is a demand for Gaffy that's established, we're very lucky, that's very nice, so people want it, they use it, good. And our goal is to have a project that is healthy or sustainable if you will and also the code base that is sustainable so that we can fix it when it breaks and so on and so on. So how do we go from this need or this demand that is there to those goals? I separate them because they have different implications but none of them makes sense without the others so that they are kind of connected. So one way to take this problem would be to look at what are the threats to the project or the code base. So the main threat would be first threat if we kind of clash with the community of users, if we don't want the same thing then that's threatening obviously the project. But then there is also two different threats for the code base, one would be what if no one wants to fix the code and what if some people do want but they cannot, for instance because they don't know how to understand the code and so on. So those are the three main threats we identify at the project level and then we can see the roadmap as fixing or preventing these threats. So this would be having a thriving Gefi community and I'm saying community kind of at large, I include here the community of developers and also the community of users who are sometimes the same and sometimes not but all of that is okay it's kind of fuzzy, I'm going to acknowledge that now so I don't know exactly what is the community but there is a community. And then we want to be able to pay developers for maintenance because we think that we could get there, that would prevent the problem of no one wanting to because of course money is an incentive, we can keep you know competencies to do that and we also want to have a clean and robust code base so that when newcomers come and want to participate in the project they can actually get involved relatively comfortably into fixing issues, improving the code and participating to the evolution of the project. But also those kind of steps towards sustainability also depend on previous steps. And one of the very big steps that is an issue for us is the fact that for us to pay someone we have to have a structure like fiscal or legal structure where if you receive funds we can legally hire someone because right now the project can work kind of in a without this administrative shell so far it's worked for us but it cannot go beyond the need of hiring people ultimately so we need to get what's called a fiscal sponsor basically so our legal and fiscal representation. We also need to raise funds, we are thinking of doing that through crowdfunding because we think that enough people are interested to give some money and we don't need that much money either and we also need to attract Java developers and if you pay the attention that we are looking for Java developers to contribute to Gefi maybe that's you. And basically so and we want to have a better community tools meaning also kind of websites tutorials and so on so those things can derive from having a demand on Gefi and of course they prompt an order in which we have to you know pile up the bricks so we have to start by having a fiscal sponsor because then we can raise funds then we can enroll Java developers because when then we can pay them if they want to participate to the project and then we can have organized the maintenance and we can have a better code base and more sustainable over the long term and that will make the Gefi project more sustainable at least on the code base level. I didn't number the track on the top which is the kind of the community track this can have it's kind of another branch of those things it can happen at the same time it's also ongoing right away but I'm going to just acknowledge that I don't want to forget about it but it's kind of independent to some extent. So that is how we think of our roadmap so our priorities are obviously the most important things for us is to make the project sustainable in practice it may mean things such as having the software easy to install for the users so something that might be overlooked but is so important to the public of Gefi which is beginners. We want to have the OpenGL so Gefi is based on an OpenGL visualization of the network so drawing on the GPU is so important to have efficiency when you have to display a large network but it has to work on many different configurations which is not obvious because of drivers and all of that. Gefi's multiplatform I didn't mention it but of course so it means Linus, Mac OS, Windows and so on. We want to be able to test everything if we can we want it to be stable we want to be able to fix the major bugs when they happen and so on. We want to finish the project at some point now it's ripe for that so that's where we are heading for and then there are other things so we would like to have the ability to stabilize core contributors so people who come and we want to keep them because they get involved in the project you know how it works and then there are other things I've listed a few here I'm not going to mention them we will come back to that so there are also a lot of other aspects that are also important even though they are kind of all over the place for the project. So our technical road map for the two was the version 1.0 it had a number of items we had established that a few years ago like two years ago and we've done part of it already. So stuff is done embedding Java so that you don't have to install Java you can know it works like you install the app Java is in and people don't have this issue of having the right version of Java. We've updated to the latest networking platforms we are now GDPR compliant in the bug reports that we receive if people want to send them to us. We are working now actively on the new OpenGL engine we'll explain why. The quick search is there is kind of a prototype already working in the last version of Gefi so you can search your notes right in the interface new icons are coming we are reworking the UI and then we have a lot of other things that we think should be there before we can call Gefi 1.0 namely the highly demanded undo feature and yeah autosave and graphic very managing parallel edges which is the hardest is done but like the last mile is not been done in like the algorithms and so on so it's coming on a bunch of other things. So one of the things we've tried to do to address that issue is to organize what we've called Gefi code sustainability retreats and now they are becoming Gefi week for obvious reasons of a short naming I think but the idea was to make the code sustainable and it's kind of evolved into something is gotten out of hands in some ways that's the kind of thing I want to say so the first one happened in 2021 and it was basically about restarting this effort of maintaining Gefi so we had to show that we are still there we're going to go back to Gefi improve it maintain it and so on and we attracted just a few people so it was kind of a small team we're just six and the version of last year so it was in a very early December last end of August beginning of December 2022 a few months ago and then we had like 22 participants in Paris including a lot of different people and this was kind of more pushing forward to other things and we're going to show you a few pictures and to tell you a little bit the story of what happened in these kind of meetings so we made a call some people answered I do want to participate we were able to fly them we pay for travel accommodation so for instance you have like on the left you have Antonin Delperge who is the maintainer of OpenRefine if you know that tool that is dedicated to cleaning data very much used in the social science and newsrooms and stuff like that and OpenRefine it used to be Google Refine so it's an open source project that had a life in the industry and it's been released it's coded in Java and it's a very well structured project so like Antonin was really good at telling us how he did it for his project or the project OpenRefine to have a fiscal sponsor he helped us design the upcoming undo feature for instance we had Tiago Peixoto that you may know for his work on community detection algorithms so it's kind of more of the hardcore researcher if you want but he's also the developer of graph tools if you know these science tools for networks and you see Mathieu explaining the code base so there was also kind of a school aspect to you know raising the competencies of every participant to understand the code base and basically the one year before it was kind of much more people much more varied people so designers researchers in social science people who are doing open source intelligence or ascent you know so it was kind of broad and of course developers and we worked all together and of course it's kind of a free for all in those situations and some people pushed in kind of unexpected directions it was good so for instance you can see someone working and making the new icons and finding new ways to visualize community detection so kind of half consolidating the code and also exploring new directions and the takeaways are that it works so it's these gaffy weeks are really working for the project they are not that expensive for what they bring us but they also go in many other directions that are super nice but not exactly what we wanted which was making the project more sustainable and they contribute kind of indirectly to that so it was an unexpected result for us because it attracted unexpected people it had unexpected outcomes it's it's becoming kind of a mini festival and we hope to make that every year so we're going to make new calls so we're also going for calling for participants it's really a nice place to be because there are so many interesting people to talk to it's really lively but we try to maintain a balance so that we don't forget about making the code robust which might be the most boring part but also the most necessary part because if gaffy just doesn't work then nothing exists of all of that hence the questions we have which is how to attract the java developers and we've not been so great at doing that in the gaffy weeks it's kind of the the flow of the of these whole operations that we fail to attract java developers so why why is it so the the idea we have is that we could look at how java developers got involved into the project so the first way you can get involved is you made gaffy yourself so that's one way another way is you've developed a plugin you know so the plugin is an entry point because you can develop plugins for gaffy some people do that because they want to implement a niche algorithm they've developed and then from there they can get to know better and better the codebase and we can maybe draw them into so it has happened so for instance from Matthew Tote he's not here he's not here so we can draw them towards the the core of gaffy you could also be a user of gaffy who also happened to be a developer and through that become involved into gaffy so this happened but it's a very slim overlap of people who have the use for gaffy and also also happen to be a developer and usually it's unconnected right so you don't use gaffy because your developers you just happen to be both also good but not so many people so the question we have is also also a question for you because it might be you but it could also you could also have an opinion about that so is there something such as a fourth path that would be i am coding or i am using gaffy in the industry as a java developer and then we would like to connect to you and see how could we draw you into the project how could you help us and stuff like that or is there just no people who work as a java dev with gaffy in the industry i would like to know that and from there i'm going to give the mic to Matthew who is the architect of the code just to give you the his battery we're going to swap oh you want me to install it to you let me put that to your okay so the mic is here okay it's fine it's fine i'll just i'll just keep it um it's out of the little it's fine okay no worries okay well so just just that it looks like so welcome everyone um i'll continue the presentation from now and i'll talk a little bit about this this more the code aspect that what we've done to to actually eventually engage more developers i mean of course uh we are open source you can you can browse all the code the code on on github and so on but that's that's only the starting point right so what what do we really need to do to make the project more inclusive for for new developers so we've done some actions and we plan to do more but it really essentially is about its you know documentation entry points we try to reduce the number of github issues so it's not kind of a complete mess when you try to understand what's going on we started to do a bit of youtube videos to teach the code base and um you know try to make the experience for somebody landing on gaffy and having an issue trying to convince them it's actually not that hard to get started on on the tickets and uh and you know here are a few videos or things you can watch and follow so um there's really other ideas but this is the main idea and we also have some open questions there you know is there actually you know technological problems so that maybe in the number of people knowing how to do java ui is not you know high enough or is not interesting enough that prevents this to happen or there are some other reasons obviously gaffy you the user base of gaffy as you know is mostly non-developers right so we're talking about a fraction of those users that might be put potentially contributors we also have the gaffy toolkit which is the kind of library version of gaffy so only the kind of core that is more used in automation that could be another entry point but we haven't explored that i want to talk now a bit about the the actual software and why you know it is so challenging so first of all gaffy is a full product in my view there is a user interface point part so um there is also some some design elements right so you have to understand you can kind of understand how to get to different functions so there's some performance issues uh and challenges right so it's it's large graphs uh you know memory efficiency so it kind of has it all um that's also what i found personally very interesting then there are some also technological challenges such as java itself uh you know we use java swing for example not so popular anymore um you know is you know how do we overcome that uh in the long run and also uh support for open gl in um in java is not is not amazing uh how do we overcome that then we have a couple of also principles that we have put into the software for a long time that may actually deliver a lot of value but also quite challenging such as uh the it's multi-threading aspect right so um there are lots of issues and bugs that may be related to the fact that everything needs to happen in parallel and that's kind of cool about gaffy but that's also for our developer pretty hard and then we also commit to have a multi-platform software right so i uh there are there are certain processes for example you need to do to certify your application on macOS it's pretty cumbersome completely different process on windows we have not developed some automation for this but it's it's it's a you know you need to spend a lot of time to make sure it works on linux and and so on and so forth um historically we haven't put enough effort into testing so um the the the quality assurance when you when you put a new release out um you know how how do you make sure that it actually works and and it doesn't have you know critical bugs then there's also the plug-in lifecycle if you submit a plug-in you know we need to kind of review that it works and that there are like dozens of plugins so everybody wants to do a new version how do you review that and manage that process and finally also the ecosystem is very wide you have graph databases you have plenty of other tools gaffy is uh you know needs to somewhat be interoperable with these other tools right to make to make the the the user's uh life easy so i'm gonna stop here it looks really doomed right so it's like we're not gonna make it but still we we have some uh some some belief in it still and partly also because the challenge is very high is very big right so that's also what i said personally i like big challenges so this uh this long list of things uh is is kind of fun as a developer but i think we also have some assets that that also makes us believe in the project in a long run uh and first of all it's a desktop tool and uh you know we've seen for example with lately the release of the m1 processor there's still a lot of innovation happening in hardware web is great and it has it can flourish but it's also great stuff on desktop we have a great modern architecture uh we have a great uh graph structure uh called graph store that's very robust very well tested and we have a fully automated uh build cycle so you can release in in one click so to speak so it it doesn't take that much effort to to put a new release out so we've built all of these things over the years and and we think that it can bring us in uh forward recently we've also been successful at rewriting certain modules uh and and seeing that they work well they're more reliable so we can kind of you know rewrite piece by piece not do a big bang uh 1.0 but kind of get along the way there by testing milestone by milestones um we've also uh have some cool work in progress such as the new visualization engine so we know that there's there's potential in in what we have in uh in in the works and finally the foundation of on which Gefi is based on for example Java itself keeps evolving the language is very mature but also there's lots of cool new things coming out uh we could you know probably 10x the performance of Gefi if you were to to leverage all of these recent innovations I will now pass it back to Mathieu for the web version yes so and we have one of the two of the developers here with us today so we're we're browsing out to the web and maybe I should start by saying how many years ago three years ago the last time there was a physical for them so we skipped two years so I think it's about three years ago we were here in this dev room uh presenting the dystopian future of Gefi in javascript a new benchmark that so we've we've actually considered very seriously the question of going full web for Gefi and the answer is there are still limitations to the web technologies that make it so that it will never be a replacement for the moment it cannot be a replacement for Gefi because it cannot go as far as Gefi in terms of scalability of large networks right so we think we what we understand of the the people using Gefi is that what they one of the things they value and that they like with Gefi is that you can start with very small networks and you know do you do your tinkering as a beginner and when you have actual data that comes from the real world and it's really big and which is coming you can scale that up to very large networks and your net your knowledge is going to scale so we are going to have Gefi and along with it a web version but that's going to be more tailored towards the beginners and networks that are not that big now if you have really big needs then you use the Java version but for teaching we think that the web version could work and we that's why we're calling it Gefi light it has it's it has a little bit less features but it also has in some ways more features because the web offers opportunities so for instance you could modify your network through JavaScript because it's the ecosystem where everything exists and I want to say that this is a different team so we know them very much but it's kind of now super it's ripe it's ready to do it you can if you have the slides they are in the first-day website you can have the see the demo I have to I do not have any more time you can see the demo and see the repository so I'm going to skip this slide for the sake of time but basically these are the things you can expect are coming and they will end with Gefi 1.0 only then we will talk about what Gefi could be differently and what do I conclude or do we conclude together what do I do I'm going to do it and then you if what I miss you do it so we're looking for fiscal sponsors if you have feedback about that because you have an open source project we'd like to know and we have a question for you should we release the version 1.0 as a way to get a better crowdfunding or should we do should we do crowdfunding in order to get to the 1.0 quicker which is at the service of the others open question we'd like to know what you think we're looking for Java devs spread the word contact us if you're interested it's it's really interesting it's really exciting community and we want to do a new Gefi week this year so in like 10 months if you can offer some sponsorship we are really interested and we'd like to discuss with you that's why we are here today so thank you very much for your attention", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.84, "text": " We've seen all the developments, we've seen Gaffy light is coming, but also what will",
