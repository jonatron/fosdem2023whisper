 So thank you very much for your attention.

In this talk, Jan Verschijl discussed the use of multiple double arithmetic on GPUs as a way to improve precision for arithmetic computations. He discussed the various advantages and disadvantages of this type of arithmetic, which originally began with hardware not yet supporting doubles in the late 1960s. Verschijl also discussed the memory and compute bound of his problems, his use of GQD, Compari, and other libraries, and some of the successful applications of double-double arithmetic, such as evaluating polynomials and computing Taylor series. All related software mentioned by Verschijl is free and open source.
