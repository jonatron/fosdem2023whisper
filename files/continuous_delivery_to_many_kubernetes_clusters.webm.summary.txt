Carlos Sanchez, a principal scientist at Adobe Experience Manager Cloud Service, discussed the challenges of running continuous delivery on Kubernetes at FOSDEM 2023. Adobe Experience Manager is a cloud-based content management system that relies heavily on open-source software from the Apache Foundation. To date, the platform has 35 Kubernetes clusters in use, as well as 11 regions worldwide. Sanchez notes that customers can run their own code, creating a serious need for strong security measures. To manage changes in the complex system, Sanchez's team uses a Hybrid Flow of GitOps and pull-based pipeline, as well as Kubernetes, Argo CD, and Helm, among other technologies. The key to the platform's scaling and speed of development lies in progressive delivery techniques that enable canary rollouts, feature flags, blue-green deployments, and percentage-based rollouts, tools to control these rollouts and automation.
