{"text": " We've been working on it for a couple of years and its sign points are focused on appliances for data centers, lights out, hands off environment. And over years ago, we've presented at the Linux security summit, we've seen details about securing secrets in TPMs for data center appliances, with some of the information about how we are going to keep those secrets in these environments. And so the key pieces that we've incorporated from that is on the discussion on machine arrest, focus on the use of security platform and the TPM2 demands that we need to guard a unique identity and keys that would be placed into a TPM book we use for identity and device authenticity. And further the operating system, we'll be able to extract the deep game secrets if we have securely looped it all the way up to kernel and user space and that the chain of trust is still verified, ensures that we are on the device we expect and we're running the software we expect as well before we can access these secrets. It also includes a port for unintended storage for access to data protection and incorporating continuous updates. The new trust for machine arrest is Certificate, an associated key pair which we protected in hardware. Certificate holds a product ID and a serial number that sort of binds it to the physical system that people are using it. And then the Certificate key pair and the TPM, those are inserted at manufacturing time and then Certificate will give us a mutable identity to verify that the device is authentic and that we'll be running the software that we expect the product expects and that it hasn't been tampered with. At the runtime of the body screen from the last, we start with our body loaded and we're executing sort of a normal view of how the kernel comes up. We'll transition into the loaded in the MFSEs startup and then we get into the machine arrest. We're going to unlock the storage to pull out our EA policies that's loaded into the TPM and then we attempt to access the registers to make sure that the values and these registers are what we expect. If they're not then we help the system run off onto the board for something that's been modified and we don't have access to any of the secrets in the TPM that we've locked away. On success though, we can go over trust keys and certs, which has phrases that are protected in the TPM, loaded into the TPM and used for only 5 minutes. And then once we have extracted that information, we extend the XR7 with the wrong measurement, which will protect further access to the TPM from any of the runtime services. Before we start the containers of the runtime service, we have to go through steps to ensure that the images that were included on the system match the product and the product's expectations and have been signed by the product certificates to verify certificates, signatures, and so for each of the OCI images in the manifest, those will be mounted and then the services can be started. We also optionally can put this into a particular OCI that we call the OCI. We want to ensure that the images stored haven't been modified and the way we do that is the stacker builds as a squash effect for all the layers in the OCI, which is a real and final system is mounted. In addition to the squash layer, the OCI images has very matches that were calculated at build time. With that, we can build a deemed very block device in Linux, which on access, as we read the first time we access that block device, the kernel will do the work of patching and evaluating whether that block is valid or it's been tampered with. For our updates, we have continuous updates as we can sync from our image repository and an update is much like what we do when we boot up. We have to go through the same sort of verification of signatures such that we know that this is the software that's expected for the device that we're running on and that all of the layers that we've built have been signed correctly. Once we've applied that, we can update our configuration database, the point to those versions for current data containers, we can send them to restart them, but if we have changes to reboot our bus or the UKI, we'll need to reboot the system so that we can execute the new versions. Lastly, for offline protection or other prevention of maybe that is sort of a maximum down, there are zero days for another kernel, we need to talk about verification.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 28.400000000000002, "text": " We've been working on it for a couple of years and its sign points are focused on appliances", "tokens": [50364, 492, 600, 668, 1364, 322, 309, 337, 257, 1916, 295, 924, 293, 1080, 1465, 2793, 366, 5178, 322, 35480, 51784], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5138152163961659, "compression_ratio": 1.1358024691358024, "no_speech_prob": 0.33208203315734863}, {"id": 1, "seek": 2840, "start": 28.4, "end": 39.36, "text": " for data centers, lights out, hands off environment.
