The speaker, Armin Purnaki, introduces a tool called the Twitter Explorer, which was built at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics and Sciences. The tool allows researchers without programming skills to collect and visualize Twitter data, making it easier for them to explore and generate hypotheses. Purnaki discusses the field of computational social science and the importance of tools like the Twitter Explorer in this context. He demonstrates the tool's features, such as collecting and visualizing tweets, building interaction networks, and analyzing clusters. Purnaki also raises questions about the future of data collection, digital privacy, and computational social science. He invites the audience to discuss these questions and shares his own concerns about the representativeness of Twitter data. Overall, the talk showcases the capabilities and potential implications of the Twitter Explorer tool in the field of computational social science.
