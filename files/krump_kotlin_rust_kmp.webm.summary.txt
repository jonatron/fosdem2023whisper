The talk discusses the benefits of using Rust in conjunction with Kotlin multiplatform to write code for multiple platforms in one language. Reasons to use Rust include its support for cryptography libraries, ICU packages, and wasm, as well as better performance for machine learning. However, debugging is tricky and bridging the two languages can be error-prone. The talk provides code examples and tools to make the process easier, and suggests writing tests to catch errors. The presenter is also working on a plugin to make the process more convenient.
