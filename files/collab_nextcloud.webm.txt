[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  So my name is Joss, I'm a co-founder of NexCloud and I talk about NexCloud aka I do marketing.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Yeah and today I'm going to talk about what's new in NexCloud.
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.000]  Now this became a little bit of a mess because we usually do about three releases a year.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  And I kind of made up three releases here but there are actually only two.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  I just mixed up our own product naming so that was a good one.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  I hope nobody is confused but we'll simplify it going forward.
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000]  So I will simply go over the products and what's new.
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  As I said I can't talk about all the features because this is just what's new which is already as I said 84 slides although we're already on the third so we'll get there.
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  Don't worry, I'll do my best at least.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  So NexCloud Hub 2, there was somewhere in March, April.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  We introduced user migration which is the first thing I'm going to show.
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  File locking, automated file locking, well low database load, always performance that's always important I think.
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  Improvements in talk, desktop integration and a couple of improvements in the groupware app.
[01:13.000 --> 01:21.000]  Now I'm going to try and show a couple of these things but there's not a lot to show a user migration that basically does what the name suggests.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  You can export your account.
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  This depends a little bit on what the app supports so we have support in a couple of the important apps like for example files.
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  And it'll of course not just export your files but also the comments on the files, activity history, what your favorite files are so these metadata gets exported.
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.000]  Of course your account itself gets exported so you know your profile name and picture and date all this stuff.
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  And the idea is that you can export your account and then go to another NexCloud server and import it there.
[01:50.000 --> 02:00.000]  NexCloud is hosted by tons of companies as well as on your own and if you say look my Raspberry Pi is pulling it anymore I need something a little faster then you can move to something bigger.
[02:01.000 --> 02:11.000]  So yeah apps need to support this so it has some limitations but you can just choose what you want to turn on so you can say okay export only my files or export files.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  And my email configuration, export this, don't export that.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  It's fairly simple just download your zip file.
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  So what else is new?
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  In NexCloud files we worked a ton on performance.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.000]  I'll get to that in a minute.
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  We introduced a search API for indexing that's basically an API for an external indexing tool like Elasticsearch that can then index a content on NexCloud and show it to you.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  Somebody for OpenProject there looks very happy.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  Excellent.
[02:38.000 --> 02:45.000]  And we introduced kind of a little thing but if you share something by mail you can then give it a password and then email them the password.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  But of course well they already have something kind of unique which is their email address.
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  So we now have a token option that they can simply say hey I have this email address they will receive a time token and then they can log in.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  You don't need to give them a password or something like that.
[03:00.000 --> 03:09.000]  So I mentioned performance and there are tons of things basically too much to talk about so I have a couple of details that are just semi randomly picked out.
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  If you view a folder in this release we got the number of database queries down by 75%.
[03:15.000 --> 03:30.000]  You can configure cron jobs so you have this background jobs that are running and you know if you have a very busy server and the cron job hits just at your most busy time that might not be helpful.
[03:30.000 --> 03:40.000]  So these background jobs you can now configure a little bit that you say hey there's a very heavy task please don't do this at like 11 o'clock or at 9 o'clock when all the employees log in for example.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  So there's a bit more configurability there.
[03:42.000 --> 03:55.000]  And it also turned out that our server was very busy generating avatars and different sizes like one application for next slide set can I have it at 65 by 65 pixels the next one wanted 66 by 66.
[03:55.000 --> 04:05.000]  This is actually a ton of work so we now just offer in a few sizes and then you know you can resize it in the browser I mean that works fine and that made quite a difference you'd be surprised.
[04:06.000 --> 04:21.000]  What we also did is we separated image preview generation so if you have you know 100,000 photos and you want to scroll in that folder then the next slide server gets very very busy generating about 100,000 previews in of course multiple sizes.
[04:21.000 --> 04:32.000]  If you do that in advance that's very nice but then that means your server is simply busy at another time so what you can do now is you can have an external service that does this.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  So it runs on a separate server doesn't book down your primary next slide server is little things makes quite a difference.
[04:39.000 --> 04:56.000]  Now I mentioned file permissions so one thing we also did is just you make the permissions a little more well advanced and you can very specifically pick out if you don't just give edit rights we can say I want the ability to upload but not edit or not delete etc.
[04:57.000 --> 05:03.000]  Other improvements were like searching for files by the tag of the file improved group folders.
[05:03.000 --> 05:16.000]  You can now use the viewer app on public links so you share somebody a PDF or an image and then they can use our internal viewer app on that public link and lots of other little things there.
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  So the next step in exit hub 2 was group pair.
[05:20.000 --> 05:33.000]  We did just a couple of features a lot of under the hood work the features are just a few one is accept and decline directly in the calendar app that just makes little quicker you already then see the calendar item you can just accept it and decline it.
[05:33.000 --> 05:45.000]  What we did in the mail app is we introduced the ability to send an email later and to undo send so you have 30 seconds to realize that well you were a little too quick with that email.
[05:45.000 --> 05:56.000]  In talk we did again under the hood work also introducing reactions which is of course always nice to zoom into then we did a media tab.
[05:56.000 --> 06:10.000]  And we integrate in the desktop client so when you get you know talk notification you can click there in the latest version of the desktop client this is even better because if you get like this operating system notification you can just click reply there and then right there already answer.
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.000]  Lisa works on Mac OS and think on Windows.
[06:13.000 --> 06:21.000]  I'm not sure if Linux has that feature maybe not yet but it's kind of cool and well here's the obligatory zoom in.
[06:21.000 --> 06:30.000]  With this release introduce a new user interface and next up office so well things fairly obvious we tried to make a little more familiar for people are migrating from.
[06:30.000 --> 06:43.000]  Certain other office applications is optional you can configure it as user but I think this yeah just makes it nicer out honestly I like the UI bit more myself I use it now so less menus to search through.
[06:43.000 --> 06:57.000]  And the nice thing is we introduced file locking already while ago so if you're working with somebody else and it's like not a file you can edit the next file but it's a Photoshop file for example need to download it edit it I'll get back to how we make that easier to later.
[06:57.000 --> 07:07.000]  But with this release we made file locking automatic so if you're an extra office you edit the file then it gets locked so that your colleague isn't on the desktop client locally editing it at the same time.
[07:07.000 --> 07:14.000]  And creating conflicts but instead desktop client will then say this file is being edited online please don't edit it locally.
[07:14.000 --> 07:22.000]  Depends a bit on the operating system whether a desktop client can enforce this or only give warnings because on Windows it's impossible to edit the file which is open.
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.000]  On Linux this is not a problem because it's a proper operating system.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  But it gives you a warning then so at least you know that you're breaking something.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  And then you can of course also right click on the file and desktop client and lock the file.
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.000]  It shows you who has locked the file if it's locked by an application it'll not say the name of whoever it was.
[07:42.000 --> 07:49.000]  But it'll say the name of the application so you can see our next text is locking this file so people are editing it on the browser.
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  Now of course in desktop client you can just right click and say open in the browser.
[07:53.000 --> 07:58.000]  Then it just opens the browser window with that file immediately editing so you can just join the editing session.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  So it shouldn't block you for anything.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  That was already up too.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  I'm going to get to the next one this has a few more slides than the other one and also a lot more features.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  Well you can read I'm just going to show it to you.
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  The first thing we did actually was to introduce a new design.
[08:14.000 --> 08:26.000]  So well it's more rounded and it also shows you your wallpaper through so people can you know pick a favorite wallpaper and then you can see through this wallpaper.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  Another benefit let me see we're back.
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  Another thing is we also worked a lot on accessibility so you have a nicer even nicer dark mouth.
[08:36.000 --> 08:44.000]  You can also set fonts for people who have problems with while reading dyslexia.
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  Yeah dark mode can also switch automatically now and a whole ton of other changes.
[08:49.000 --> 09:00.000]  If you use a different background to show you some more screenshots if you like it bubbly maybe you like a little darker you know that's for the real hackers dark mode with dark background.
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  I now realize that even though I'm not a hacker I do run this background by default I like it.
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  Either way what we also did is once again performance.
[09:09.000 --> 09:16.000]  I can once again of course go in all the details but let me quickly first cover security which we also work on for every release.
[09:16.000 --> 09:23.000]  If you use a server side encryption we allow you to encrypt S3 based primary storage.
[09:23.000 --> 09:31.000]  Object storage encrypt encryption networks with group folders which are used a lot and it takes 33% less storage.
[09:31.000 --> 09:39.000]  So it used to be that our encryption algorithm really blew up the size of the files by about a third and now well that's gone so it gets more again.
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  And a couple of OCC commands to manage the encryption on the client side.
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  We also made a bunch of improvements with user end to end encryption in the desktop client and the mobile client.
[09:49.000 --> 09:50.000]  It's faster.
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  There was very helpful other people complained with a lot of files it was slow which it was.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  We also made key management a little nicer so you can also in the browser reset your keys.
[09:59.000 --> 10:07.000]  That also means you lose access to all your files if you forgot your password but you can start over if you made a mistake or forgot your password.
[10:07.000 --> 10:17.000]  And administrators can unsay groups of users or individual users can give them access to the end to end encryption or not so it can be controlled as well.
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  I mentioned performance there was tons of stuff I think in core alone we did 33 separate improvements.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  I'm not going to show all of them I'm just going to pick out a few of them otherwise it gets a little crazy.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  So sorting of files when the tone faster because we only sort the recently changed files.
[10:37.000 --> 10:45.000]  It's a little thing but if you're in a folder with tons of files and you want to sort all of them why would you do that if you just need to sort the newest on top.
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Only look at the newer files.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  It's little things but it gets a lot faster.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  Search became about seven times faster.
[10:52.000 --> 11:03.000]  And all these things they add up because by now if you do a prop find which is kind of operation that a client checks hey has anything changed on the server that is now about 30 percent faster.
[11:03.000 --> 11:12.000]  So you know it's it's really common operations they don't get of course a seven times speed up but all these seven times and little things they add up to well 20 30 percent.
[11:13.000 --> 11:22.000]  If you upgrade to this release you should really notice it because pages load about a third faster and I think that's kind of where you notice a difference yourself.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  So anyway that's a really good stuff there.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  Now let's talk about the features.
[11:26.000 --> 11:27.000]  Next I'll talk.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  So we introduced polls.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  I mean that's really nice.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  Also a couple of other things.
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  For example you now have what we call widgets.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  If you can share if you share a deck card you can then see the information of the deck card.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  There's also works with GitHub tickets.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  It works with YouTube videos.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  It works with tons of other stuff.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  Even maps locations and such.
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  And that also shows in the media bar on the site that we introduced in the previous release.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  So I think that's really quite nice.
[11:56.000 --> 12:02.000]  We introduced the ability to basically start a call but not send a notification to everybody.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  So if you're in a big group and you want to have a call with only three members.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  You can start a call but then not for 60 people their phones are ringing.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  That might be a little annoying.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  And you can do the same with sending messages.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  So you can send a message but if you do this Saturday night you shouldn't bother your entire team.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  They all get a ping on their phone because it's bloody weekend.
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.000]  Why do you do this?
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  Maybe you shouldn't be working.
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  But if you do then at least you can send it without generating notifications.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  Of course in NextLoud you can also configure your availability and just say outside of these hours.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  Please put me automatically and do not disturb.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  That also helps.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  But still you can control this.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  But then of course you might actually want to send somebody call notifications because you're in the call with three people
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  and you want number four then you can actually ring their phone this way directly.
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  So all the way around.
[12:49.000 --> 12:52.000]  We also introduced message expiration.
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.000]  The widgets that I just already mentioned also works then with YouTube.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  We can also directly now create files and a ton of different ones.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  The poll I already mentioned.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  But also create a new document and then it just opens up as immediately shared with everybody.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  You can immediately start editing your office document or whatever you created.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  So that's nice.
[13:13.000 --> 13:21.000]  And in a classroom or webinar you might sometimes want to stop people from talking and we expanded the access rights with this as well.
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  So you can now say okay you know you can't post messages you cannot react.
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  You know no talking until well it's time to open that.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  We also worked on scalability quite a bit.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  We introduced clustering to the high performance backend.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  So for bigger calls but honestly we don't use a clustering ourselves.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  We're now using it for webinars.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  We had 350 people a couple of weeks ago.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  So that works still on one server.
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000]  But there is of course a point that you want to have a call with even more people and then you need clustering.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  And that's helpful.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  All right.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  Let's talk about group fare for a minute.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  This always makes for a nice screenshot.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  So we introduced a nice org chart in our contacts app.
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  You just define who is the boss of who and then it creates a graph that you can zoom in and out and all this stuff.
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  Very simple but it's nice was done by a community project was supported by the EU.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  So yay for our EU overlords here in Brussels.
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  Yeah the mail app also got a nice overhaul mostly UI improvements.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  I'll get to a couple of features in a minute.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  Well that's actually right now.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  So less than a minute.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  You can have now images in your signatures.
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  You can configure an autoresponder directly in next clouds.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  And we made the UI of the appointment booking.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.000]  So this is kind of like currently I guess that's been a feature in Excel for a while and we improved the UI a little.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  You can create certain dates and times that people can book meetings with you.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  You also updated the create new account wizard attachment viewer is now right in mail.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  So if you have a PDF just click it you can view it.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  I map invite support so in an email you get an invitation for the calendar.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  You just click accept and then you're in there etc.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  So all good stuff.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  Let's get to office as I have less than 10 minutes left.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  I know it's terrible.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  So what did we do?
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  Yeah, you can upload custom fonts.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  That's actually super helpful because half the documents that look shit in collaboration lines.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  Next out of office just look bad because of the fonts.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  It's very simple.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  In many cases that's the problem with it.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  And well you can now easily add your fonts in the UI.
[15:26.000 --> 15:35.000]  What you can also do is if a document still looks bad or if it uses like really weird features that require like local data connections between documents and this stuff.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  There's now a button on the top left that says open locally.
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  You click on it.
[15:40.000 --> 15:46.000]  It said are you sure you say yes if you are and then it'll just log the file.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  Open it on your desktop in Microsoft Office for example or Libre Office on your desktop.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  You edit it.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  You close.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  It syncs it back to the server and unlocks the file.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.000]  This is awesome.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  Perfect compatibility because whatever you run locally works.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  Obviously this also works for your Photoshop files.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  So you just go and next out you look up the file.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  You click the three dot menu.
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.000]  You click open locally Photoshop opens when you're done.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  You close it.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  It unlocks the file again and your colleagues can work again with it too.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  So fairly simple.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  The button is like the one next to the save button.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  The third one top left.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  Right.
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  We also have this app called Collective.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  It's a knowledge based application.
[16:26.000 --> 16:33.000]  We introduced a whole bunch of improvements like an outline that you see on the left here and tons of other stuff.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  Honestly I need to speed up a little bit.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  So I will skip through most of this but it's a lot of good stuff.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  Believe me you can add mentioned colleagues.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  You can search for the content of these things in Universal Search and the widgets work as well.
[16:46.000 --> 16:53.000]  So you can if you have a link to a GitHub issue or to a YouTube video then it just shows you right there the content.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  And here are the fonts by the way I just mentioned so you can upload them nice and easy.
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.000]  Next up photos.
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.000]  Really cool.
[17:00.000 --> 17:07.000]  We introduced photo albums so you can create a photo album and put photos in there without having to actually move them around.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  You can invite other people to it and share them with them.
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.000]  Then we introduced image recognition so there's an AI neural network thingy.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  No we're not sending it to Google.
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  It's running local on your server and it'll recognize different objects.
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  It'll recognize different faces, different people.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  Tags them and then you can find them by tags.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  A little bit more screen shots later.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  Super cool.
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.000]  Also introduced the photo editor so you can rotate crop and some filters, all the basic stuff for your photos.
[17:36.000 --> 17:41.000]  So Google killed photos so you can move over now.
[17:41.000 --> 17:48.000]  I was trying to, well I have lots of zoom instincts but you have a nice uploader now that shows you
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.000]  here are the faces that it automatically recognize and then you can click one and then you go
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  well and you see all the pictures of that person.
[17:56.000 --> 17:57.000]  It's fairly simple.
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  It can even recognize music genres.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  Obviously not in the photos app but in the music app to be clear.
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  But it's really cool and again it's not using a database, it's using machine learning.
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.000]  So it really looks, well listens in this case and figures out the genre.
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  I don't know how good it is.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  I've heard it's actually surprisingly good.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  So really cool.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  And again all this is on your server.
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  No data is sent anywhere else unlike the big clouds.
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  It even works on a Raspberry Pi.
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  So that's pretty cool I think.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  On the clients we really did a ton of work for this release.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  You can of course edit files also on your tablet.
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  Next up Office will work on your tablet, on your phone, etc.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  But we also introduced widgets.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  So you have these widgets when you open NextLoud you have the dashboard.
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  These widgets are now also on your tablet and on your phone if you want them.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  They use the native widgets, the iOS widgets.
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  So you have these widgets on iOS where you can have NextLoud widgets from your dashboard,
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  on your phone, on your tablet, etc.
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.000]  Really cool I think.
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  I think I have some examples here exactly.
[19:03.000 --> 19:09.000]  So your files, notifications, changes, files shared with you, etc.
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  On Windows you now get this.
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.000]  So if you have a virtual file system on Windows so you're not syncing all the files
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  but you view them and when you click them they get synced.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  But at least you get previews in the meantime that's new as well.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  Quite nice.
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.000]  Androids, few improvements, iOS improvements as well.
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  I will not go into details because we are really getting there.
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  Those were the widgets.
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.000]  Two other nice things in the last two minutes I think I have left.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  We made it a lot easier to get NextLoud.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  So there has been a Docker image for NextLoud for a long time.
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  And this was a kind of IKEA inspired Docker image I would say.
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000]  You had to bring your own database and your own file system and your own, you know,
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  so you're really setting up like a bunch of Docker images.
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.000]  It's very nice if you're really into Kubernetes and that stuff.
[20:02.000 --> 20:06.000]  If you never heard of Kubernetes like most people we now have an all-in-one Docker image.
[20:06.000 --> 20:11.000]  You just download this one Docker image and well it'll give you a nice overview.
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  It runs all the other containers in there.
[20:13.000 --> 20:15.000]  It's super easy to use.
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.000]  We even did a, because we made a VM version of it.
[20:18.000 --> 20:22.000]  Just a VM we've done this Docker image running in it on Ubuntu I think.
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  Which you can then run on Windows if you want.
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  So now suddenly NextLoud is available for Windows Server if you so wish.
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.000]  It's still running Linux obviously, right?
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000]  It's not going crazy here but even has backup by the way built in.
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  There is by the way a NextLoud backup app but that's using something completely different.
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  That allows you to backup to another NextLoud server.
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  Times up.
[20:45.000 --> 20:52.000]  I have to tell you by the way that you can deploy this all-in-one container with one click on these platforms.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  So if you really love the cloud but you want a little more control you can still run NextLoud
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  on any of these with one, two clicks and then you have it deployed there.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  So we're in their app stores basically.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  Not all of them are fully finished yet but we're working on it.
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.000]  We'll get there.
[21:07.000 --> 21:08.000]  Anyway, questions?
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.000]  Sorry.
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  Only a few seconds over time.
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.000]  It's not so bad.
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.000]  Questions?
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.000]  Come on.
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  Go authoring.
[21:14.000 --> 21:15.000]  Yeah.
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  Sorry?
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  Go authoring.
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.000]  Go authoring of a document.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  So you mean collaborative editing?
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  Yes, absolutely.
[21:21.000 --> 21:25.000]  So in NextLoud Office but also NextLoud Techs are note-taking and also the knowledge base.
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  So if you're editing a knowledge base document you can do it with 20 people if you like.
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.000]  I mean I don't know why you won't.
[21:34.000 --> 21:40.000]  So well on iOS and the Android and iOS apps they do it but on the desktop client not that
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  it would open in a browser.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  So you do right click you say edit document and it opens a browser window and then you're
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.000]  in there.
[21:46.000 --> 21:47.000]  Thank you.
[21:47.000 --> 21:48.000]  Yeah.
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  Does the knowledge base support markdown?
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  Does the knowledge base support markdown?
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  Yes, it is markdown.
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  It dreams markdown.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  It lives markdown.
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  Everything is markdown.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  Other than NextLoud Office but it's NextLoud Text but then in a different way.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  So it has these widgets and all the other stuff just like text.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  They're basically, I don't know, it's like text but then with a sidebar that lets you
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  search and, you know, choose and link to other documents.
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  It's just text and steroids.
[22:14.000 --> 22:15.000]  Yes.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  Can I talk with other servers?
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  Can you talk with other servers?
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  Yes, multiple ways but NextLoud has a federation feature so you can share a file to the server
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  of your friend.
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  Talk.
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.000]  Yeah, so NextLoud Talk.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  No, at the moment talk is not federated.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  It's something we want to do but I don't have an ETA for you.
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  Thank you.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  Next.
[22:36.000 --> 22:43.000]  Is the photo add one?
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.000]  The photos app is the default photos app with the recognition everything.
[22:48.000 --> 22:49.000]  Yes.
[22:49.000 --> 22:50.000]  Yeah.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  Yeah, for the recognition of faces because you need to download a gigantic, you know,
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  thing file there.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  You need to separately install the recognized app and that's about, I don't know, I think
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  it's a gigabyte plus because it needs to download this network that can recognize your pictures
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  on your server.
[23:07.000 --> 23:13.000]  It has ARM and X86 so it should work in most places but this is a separate action.
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  But the photos app itself is there.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  Yes.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  Collections use local content?
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  Collect this.
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  You mean the, what do you mean with local content?
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  You mean you can insert a file in there?
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  Yeah.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  Yes, you can.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  Yes, in this file document, files from NextLoud.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  Of course if it's not on NextLoud it will upload it and put it in a same folder.
[23:32.000 --> 23:33.000]  Yes.
[23:33.000 --> 23:40.000]  In the forms app, is it not possible to share the admin so several people can read the form
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  or see the result?
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  No, not yet but that's something we would want to do.
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  So the forms app, you have NextLoud forms apps like Google forms but then you're not
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  giving all your data to Evil America company.
[23:52.000 --> 23:59.000]  Yeah, and the question was can multiple people see and manage the same form and this is unfortunately
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  not yet possible.
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.000]  So the person who creates the form, they can export the data in a spreadsheet but they
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.000]  can currently not yet give management to other people.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  We'll get there.
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  Yes.
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.000]  You said something about talk, having clever people in the talk.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  Yeah.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  Can they all see each other?
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  No.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  How many people can see each other?
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  So you can control access rights and if you have infinite network bandwidth then everybody
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  can see everybody.
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  In the real world, no.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  And it purely depends on your network bandwidth here.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  But does the grid view of the talk, what?
[24:34.000 --> 24:41.000]  I think the grid view goes to 20 people or so and beyond that you start to scroll to
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  the next page, next page.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  But I believe it scales with the size of your monitor.
[24:45.000 --> 24:51.000]  If you have a gigantic monitor and a high resolution, again, no, it's open source and
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.000]  it's self-hosted.
[24:52.000 --> 24:58.000]  You are always the limiting factor, believe me.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.000]  Anything else?
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.000]  We talked about the local talk client.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  Local talk client.
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.000]  No, so we have Android and iOS client for talk at the moment.
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  But stay tuned.
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  That's it.
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  Awesome.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  Thank you for being here, everybody.
[25:20.000 --> 25:36.000]  It's self-hosted, you are always the limiting factor.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  Thank you.
