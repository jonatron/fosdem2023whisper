The talk discusses the concept of micro front-ends, which involves dividing different pages of a web application into different repositories and integrating them at runtime. The talk focuses on Webpack's plugin module federation, which allows for this paradigm to be possible by fetching modules from a remote location. The use of module federation helps solve issues of growing monoliths and dependence across multiple teams. The talk also includes a code demo and discusses the OpenShift Console project, which uses this technique. Questions from the audience include the impact on server performance, security concerns, and managing multiple versions of dependencies.
