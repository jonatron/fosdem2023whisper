The talk presented a compliance toolchain for yacht projects, specifically for the Eclipse Oniro project, which is an all-scenario platform project. The toolchain was built with the help of the Neuropath Tech Park and is intended to be a toolchain for all of the Octobase projects. The compliance toolchain uses SPDX, a standard for communicating the components, licenses, and copyrights associated with a software package. The toolchain ensures that all components are tracked for compliance, and the second phase of the compliance toolchain involves a graph database to handle software composition analysis, dependencies analysis, and incompatibility checks. The talk also discussed a battle between license cards to ensure that inbound and outbound licenses are compatible with each other. The goal is to upstream everything into the Creator Speedyx class in the Yachto project.
