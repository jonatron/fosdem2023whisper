00:00.000 --> 00:13.720
Hello, everyone. So we have here Benjamin Jamie who will be sharing should there be

00:13.720 --> 00:19.440
a standard and Libra localization. Ideas on how to make it easy for translators to contribute

00:19.440 --> 00:28.180
to any FOSS project they like. Thank you, Benjamin.

00:28.180 --> 00:37.920
Thank you for the applause. I didn't deserve that yet, definitely. Thank you for being

00:37.920 --> 00:45.040
in such a large count here. So I'm Benjamin. I work in WebLate. I do the talking there

00:45.040 --> 00:53.880
and you can also meet Michael in this lovely hoodie here and he's the mind behind the code

00:53.880 --> 01:00.800
and everything and the founder. I won't be talking much about WebLate here. That's the

01:00.800 --> 01:05.640
talk tomorrow in translation's dev room. Here I would like to share a story and kick

01:05.640 --> 01:12.840
off something probably that could become a standard in Libra localization because at

01:12.840 --> 01:21.200
the moment it's nothing like that there. At first I would like to talk a short start

01:21.200 --> 01:28.040
of WebLate story. It doesn't start like a masterminded start-up plan that will get a

01:28.040 --> 01:33.040
lot of money and conquer the world of the localization. No, that's other companies.

01:33.040 --> 01:38.720
We are Libra software from the start and Michael actually started it when he was working at

01:38.720 --> 01:47.440
SUSE and now SUSE people are very proud that they started it during the SUSE hack week 12

01:47.440 --> 02:00.080
years ago. Sorry, 11 years ago. And for a long time this is the office. It was actually

02:00.080 --> 02:07.160
the office at the top of the building of those large concrete buildings you have around the

02:07.160 --> 02:16.040
Czech Republic built in socialism and when you needed an elevator there, there was those

02:16.040 --> 02:21.600
like small on top of the building blocks where you put all the machinery for your elevator

02:21.600 --> 02:27.440
but it's not needed now so all the machinery is downstairs in the shaft and Michael had

02:27.440 --> 02:32.560
his office on the top of the building and it's like three to four meters or something

02:32.560 --> 02:40.240
like that and that's how he started it and it was not aimed to do something that will

02:40.240 --> 02:51.480
be masterminded and well prepared for all the use cases. It was just in the start the

02:51.480 --> 02:58.120
use case that Michael wanted something better than PUTL which was a very popular tool but

02:58.120 --> 03:04.440
no longer maintained and something that's very tightly integrated with this version

03:04.440 --> 03:09.840
control system so you don't have to do much of the manual work and you are a developer

03:09.840 --> 03:13.680
so you connect Weblight to your version control system and it just works. You don't have to

03:13.680 --> 03:21.320
care about anything and then everything is in the editor and you know localization editors

03:21.320 --> 03:32.560
from Weblight and from other similar tools and then more and more big open source projects

03:32.560 --> 03:38.880
and some commercial companies went to ask Michael, hey, we would like to use it. Can

03:38.880 --> 03:48.600
we pay you for supporting it and yeah that's how Weblight started getting bigger and these

03:48.600 --> 04:00.960
days there are large or small Libre projects that are using Weblight and oh sorry I forgot

04:00.960 --> 04:11.240
to put a pen pod logo there. We'll do tomorrow but there is Calidas and more and more Libre

04:11.240 --> 04:20.840
projects started using it and it became some sort of a go for tool and then Fedora came

04:20.840 --> 04:27.400
I think three years back to us and migrated all their stuff from Xanata from their original

04:27.400 --> 04:33.680
platform they created to Weblight because Xanata was like we don't have time for that,

04:33.680 --> 04:42.240
that's not our core of business so we won't use Weblight and that's how we realized that

04:42.240 --> 04:51.360
this is maybe the thing that will be happening more and it became our responsibility. We

04:51.360 --> 04:57.560
took very seriously to give the tool to the communities that they can use happily and

04:57.560 --> 05:05.240
they can contribute to but it's still just one platform. It's Weblight and we created

05:05.240 --> 05:12.560
last year a page called Discover Weblight so if you are on a hosted Weblight, if you

05:12.560 --> 05:17.560
have your projects on a hosted Weblight which is the largest instance of Weblight on the

05:17.560 --> 05:23.160
internet it's easy to search there and it will be even easier throughout this year because

05:23.160 --> 05:35.440
of the development and if you host yourself your instance we wanted to give the users

05:35.440 --> 05:42.480
a place where they can come and search through all the Weblight instances that are open to

05:42.480 --> 05:49.360
contribute to this page so at this point if the project is using Weblight you have this

05:49.360 --> 05:55.120
place and you can search for your project name let's say Benpot and you will be guided

05:55.120 --> 06:00.400
to the right place and you can contribute to the localizations there but what about

06:00.400 --> 06:07.520
if the project because there are so many projects in Libra world that are not using Weblight

06:07.520 --> 06:13.080
yet or they want to stick with different tool because it's always your choice what do you

06:13.080 --> 06:30.680
use in your community. Sorry. So there became an idea and I think two years back and that's

06:30.680 --> 06:36.680
really important to say the time frame I was speaking with Dwayne. Dwayne is a wonderful

06:36.680 --> 06:45.000
person author of Translate Toolkit which is one of the core component for that Weblight

06:45.000 --> 06:54.840
uses to work with translation files and Dwayne is very talkative like I am so we were talking

06:54.840 --> 07:02.560
a lot and then I told him yeah and maybe there should be a way for someone that wants to

07:02.560 --> 07:10.040
contribute to Libra software like one place possibly federated because so it's not in

07:10.040 --> 07:17.600
one central place where I as a translator of Libra software that's not technically

07:17.600 --> 07:23.440
savvy and I want to contribute the time to the project of my choice but I don't want

07:23.440 --> 07:32.680
to search through readme's and wiki's because every project has its own different way or

07:32.680 --> 07:38.800
there is no information and you have to really dig hard to find it or if you are at Fosdem

07:38.800 --> 07:47.480
you can walk around the booths and see a little bit like a little advertisement or small stand

07:47.480 --> 07:55.680
that says this project is localized on Weblight but if you are in the online world you are

07:55.680 --> 08:00.920
you will spend usually a lot of time to find where is the right place to localize your

08:00.920 --> 08:06.840
favorite software and I told that to Dwayne and Dwayne said oh yeah I had that idea a

08:06.840 --> 08:14.760
while before and I have it very roughly specified and we were talking more and then he sent

08:14.760 --> 08:24.200
like nine pages long nice specification of how it could look like and how it could work

08:24.200 --> 08:30.000
and there are so many other features that we would like to have there but that was two

08:30.000 --> 08:43.640
years ago and nothing happened because there is no time to do that in Weblight team and

08:43.640 --> 08:49.920
it should be a community thing it shouldn't be something that Weblight says this is the

08:49.920 --> 08:55.560
thing how you should do it and everybody should use it it can be like that but we are at Fosdem

08:55.560 --> 09:03.400
there are so many wonderfully skilled people that may be interested in not only helping

09:03.400 --> 09:11.540
with the actual development but also sharing their ideas and maybe they because it's such

09:11.540 --> 09:18.720
obvious thing that's missing maybe there are so many people that already have similar ideas

09:18.720 --> 09:26.280
or some kind of specification and I would like to use this talk if you have an idea

09:26.280 --> 09:32.520
I just want to kick it off we are not working on it yet we just want to connect we want

09:32.520 --> 09:40.160
to discuss and maybe in a year on next Fosdem we will have something like that and a lot

09:40.160 --> 09:49.640
of projects could use that or every project on Fosdem and it shouldn't be just about

09:49.640 --> 09:56.600
Weblight it should be maybe a file like you have a license file in your repository or

09:56.600 --> 10:05.080
a readme file that can be indexed by some tool so if I want to have an instance a server

10:05.080 --> 10:12.800
where I could guide let's say I'm a localization lab or some other lovely group of people that

10:12.800 --> 10:18.620
wants to localize open source software they can use some kind of tool put it on their

10:18.620 --> 10:25.000
website on their own server and tell if you have your time select language you want to

10:25.000 --> 10:34.520
contribute to and find your project and this might should index those readme's or translation

10:34.520 --> 10:44.480
md files from not only github and gitlab but probably more and more can it be done probably

10:44.480 --> 10:50.040
yes it has it will have some limits it probably won't scan all the repositories in the world

10:50.040 --> 10:57.120
that's not possible but maybe we can make something bigger than discover Weblight that's

10:57.120 --> 11:08.400
universal use for everyone now what should they do is to guide the translator to the

11:08.400 --> 11:14.920
right platform to the right place because if I'm a translator I don't and I don't know

11:14.920 --> 11:22.480
all the technical way of the localization which can be make easier by localization management

11:22.480 --> 11:33.480
software like Weblight I just want to translate my hello to hello and that's it and it should

11:33.480 --> 11:40.160
be unified so everybody can use it it should be possible to index it somehow to search

11:40.160 --> 11:48.640
through it and yeah that's that's a start and probably there is much more that it should

11:48.640 --> 11:58.280
do it but in a started this would be nice and yeah let's discuss if you go not right

11:58.280 --> 12:04.560
now because I have to add a link once I finish the talk but this is the place where you can

12:04.560 --> 12:12.640
go and search through Weblight schedule I just double check yeah it's right there is

12:12.640 --> 12:19.280
no miss click so if you go there you can see all the schedule all the plans we as Weblight

12:19.280 --> 12:25.800
have for this for them I will add there a link to the discussion and you can join you

12:25.800 --> 12:33.640
can share it with your friends that are interested in such things and maybe we will come up with

12:33.640 --> 12:43.160
something interesting for every possible translator in the Libre community or in ideal way this

12:43.160 --> 12:54.880
tool or this localization file or translation and whatever we will call it can do can welcome

12:54.880 --> 13:03.240
you translators that don't feel I'm a translator and then don't know how to get there maybe

13:03.240 --> 13:11.920
to make it easy for everyone so that's it that's what I wanted to share with you and

13:11.920 --> 13:21.120
yeah I'm interested in what do you think maybe we still have three minutes so we can talk

13:21.120 --> 13:30.880
something right now you can also if you go to that link you can also find our bio stickers

13:30.880 --> 13:37.000
t-shirts and yeah other things and you can share your ideas there about Weblight and

13:37.000 --> 13:43.080
what we should include and if you don't like something just come there and tell us or you

13:43.080 --> 13:51.080
can join the online discussion that will be ready in a few minutes and yeah thank you

13:51.080 --> 13:57.320
for your attention and if anybody has a question or anything just raise your hand or come here

13:57.320 --> 14:01.760
and tell it to us thank you for your time and injera for them
