[00:00.000 --> 00:15.280]  Okay, my name is Robbie Morrison and I'm here to talk about energy system modelling.
[00:15.280 --> 00:19.400]  I want to take you right up to the stratosphere.
[00:19.400 --> 00:24.520]  A couple of things on my background, I won't go through all this, but I started climate
[00:24.520 --> 00:27.360]  campaigning 33 years ago.
[00:27.360 --> 00:38.520]  I started high resolution national energy system modelling 23 years ago, and I started
[00:38.520 --> 00:44.720]  open source energy system modelling 20 years ago, so I was right at the beginning of those
[00:44.720 --> 00:48.080]  trends pretty much.
[00:48.080 --> 00:53.280]  I want to talk briefly about the open energy modelling initiative, which started about
[00:53.280 --> 01:00.480]  eight years ago, and it's an informal collection of modellers.
[01:00.480 --> 01:06.560]  We now have about 1,000 people involved.
[01:06.560 --> 01:12.840]  The bulk of them are early stage full time researchers, and that gives you an idea of
[01:12.840 --> 01:16.680]  how much sort of interest there is in this open side.
[01:16.680 --> 01:21.800]  There is an entire parallel universe doing clothes modelling that we don't have much
[01:21.800 --> 01:27.960]  contact with in the power companies, in the World Bank, in the multilateral organisations,
[01:27.960 --> 01:32.040]  so I'm only going to talk about the open source side.
[01:32.040 --> 01:46.120]  The final point up here is that this whole field has flipped in the last year radically.
[01:46.120 --> 01:53.720]  I get contacted by corporations and economists and so forth now, which would never have happened
[01:53.720 --> 01:59.840]  two years ago, so this is a complete game change.
[01:59.840 --> 02:03.560]  I'm not going to talk very much about energy system modelling, but if you want an introduction
[02:03.560 --> 02:10.200]  I recommend this YouTube, which is made with my partner in the car park, and it's descriptive
[02:10.200 --> 02:13.200]  and it's quite good.
[02:13.200 --> 02:17.800]  This is a quick schematic showing what these models can capture.
[02:17.800 --> 02:22.760]  This just happens to be one that I pulled up that's hybrid with agent based modelling
[02:22.760 --> 02:30.920]  in it, but you see a lot of the entities, if you like, that were being discussed in
[02:30.920 --> 02:36.160]  the previous talks, but brought together in a collective.
[02:36.160 --> 02:41.440]  So we have households and we have market operators and we have lines companies and we have markets
[02:41.440 --> 02:49.480]  and we have AC power flow and we have a lot of kith and the system, hydrosystems, storage,
[02:49.480 --> 02:57.080]  gas turbine sets and so forth, and a whole lot of external characteristics coming in
[02:57.080 --> 03:07.400]  through weather conditions, interest rates and so forth, so that's the broad picture.
[03:07.400 --> 03:13.600]  If you want to look at the models that exist, this Wikipedia page is worthwhile, it's about
[03:13.600 --> 03:18.000]  half complete and it covers the various models.
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.720]  Some are directed specifically to the energy sector, but increasingly they're a sector
[03:23.720 --> 03:28.640]  coupled and they come into the whole energy system.
[03:28.640 --> 03:38.440]  The basic paradigm is operations research, so the underlying model produces a set of
[03:38.440 --> 03:45.200]  constraints in a sparse matrix, has a goal function which is normally minimum aggregate
[03:45.200 --> 03:53.160]  cost and feeds that all into a solver and returns a result.
[03:53.160 --> 03:59.320]  The way that the analysis proceeds is by so called comparative analysis of scenarios,
[03:59.320 --> 04:07.560]  so you pick a base scenario, a reference scenario and then you propose different scenarios
[04:07.560 --> 04:16.960]  that you want to explore with nuclear, without nuclear and so on and so on.
[04:16.960 --> 04:22.120]  These are the high resolution, they have a lot of detail in them, so they have the plant
[04:22.120 --> 04:24.680]  and the network and so forth in them.
[04:24.680 --> 04:30.240]  A lot of external circumstances, weather, demand for energy services and so forth.
[04:30.240 --> 04:34.360]  They are contiguous time which is really important nowadays because with renewables
[04:34.360 --> 04:41.280]  and storage you can't kind of do typical periods, you actually have to work your way
[04:41.280 --> 04:45.160]  through the entire system as it evolves.
[04:45.160 --> 04:52.840]  The evolution might be out for 30 years, out to 2050.
[04:52.840 --> 04:57.960]  There's a degree of different types of foresight, sometimes it's perfect foresight so we know
[04:57.960 --> 05:07.280]  everything about the future, other times it's stepwise so we do recursive dynamics.
[05:07.280 --> 05:15.840]  What up here, technological progress is included, one factor, multi-factor, for example the
[05:15.840 --> 05:23.480]  uptake of a particular technology like solar PV will, the model will internally reduce
[05:23.480 --> 05:31.120]  the costs for that particular technology as it's taken up and it evolves through time.
[05:31.120 --> 05:37.680]  The optimisation is usually mixed into linear programming, anything else more exotic runs
[05:37.680 --> 05:41.040]  into performance issues.
[05:41.040 --> 05:49.280]  Conceptual extensions include embedded decision taking using agency, multi-criteria optimisation,
[05:49.280 --> 05:55.720]  some assessment of co-benefits such as urban air quality, sensitivity to the framing of
[05:55.720 --> 06:04.320]  the problem, the role of uncertainty and the exploration of near optimal solutions.
[06:04.320 --> 06:10.400]  So this is system modelling, all systems have kind of natural systems and problems if you
[06:10.400 --> 06:14.760]  like together have natural boundaries.
[06:14.760 --> 06:21.880]  If you want to model Europe or we want to model an energy system in Germany you probably
[06:21.880 --> 06:29.520]  want to go to the boundaries of Europe for example because that's kind of a natural point.
[06:29.520 --> 06:36.800]  The methods or naturally seek technical synergies, that's one of the advantages of using these
[06:36.800 --> 06:46.320]  systems, the least cost approach will pick up the synergies and get them working.
[06:46.320 --> 06:52.840]  Future climate change is normally included, projected future climate change.
[06:52.840 --> 06:59.840]  These models may exhibit undue sensitivity to both data quality and to system resolution
[06:59.840 --> 07:08.040]  so they're not without issues that have to be explored by modellers.
[07:08.040 --> 07:16.080]  They started off with energy systems, electricity systems coupled into district heating and
[07:16.080 --> 07:25.000]  into gas and so forth but they're increasingly branching out into land usage, water use,
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.640]  the industrial sector when you're looking at things like hydrogen, ammonia, thermal
[07:29.640 --> 07:32.800]  integration and steel production.
[07:32.800 --> 07:40.800]  Carbon capture is included now outside of the energy system so residual emissions from
[07:40.800 --> 07:46.000]  cement and from agriculture are now being included in these models.
[07:46.000 --> 07:52.360]  Comparability also and we've had some talks about vehicle charging but this is to look
[07:52.360 --> 07:59.720]  at the whole picture and not just the perspective of the householder or even the lines company.
[07:59.720 --> 08:04.240]  Co-benefits beyond climate change mitigation I mentioned.
[08:04.240 --> 08:09.400]  What isn't in the models is there is no embedded economy.
[08:09.400 --> 08:14.800]  If you want to do that then you have to go to process based integrated assessment models
[08:14.800 --> 08:24.440]  which are widely used by the IPCC and in which case you have a lot more kind of an economic
[08:24.440 --> 08:29.160]  take on the system.
[08:29.160 --> 08:34.840]  The model started off being open source but there are good reasons why we want to look
[08:34.840 --> 08:43.400]  beyond open source and the one, the first reason is to go to open science.
[08:43.400 --> 08:50.160]  So we want genuinely open data and we want it under communal curation.
[08:50.160 --> 08:57.400]  We want full transparency and as modelers we want an engaged overarching community so
[08:57.400 --> 09:04.600]  that we can compare and contribute and support each other.
[09:04.600 --> 09:13.640]  The goal in my kind of take is that we should be looking at public policy analysis which
[09:13.640 --> 09:19.400]  is based on peer production, on commons based peer production and the reason I say that
[09:19.400 --> 09:25.400]  and I think there was a talk earlier this morning from the European Commission, people
[09:25.400 --> 09:30.920]  like the European Commission do not have the capacity to explore the solution space and
[09:30.920 --> 09:37.160]  I will add nor do they have the creativity required.
[09:37.160 --> 09:40.080]  That's not a criticism, that's just an observation.
[09:40.080 --> 09:48.160]  So we really want a massive effort in exploring what our future could be out to 2050, the
[09:48.160 --> 09:54.920]  kind of trajectories and pathways and requirements that are needed.
[09:54.920 --> 10:00.680]  Some potential for public engagement but very few examples to date when these models
[10:00.680 --> 10:05.640]  are used for more specific projects.
[10:05.640 --> 10:12.520]  Our biggest Achilles heel is complete and coherent data for public interest analysis.
[10:12.520 --> 10:20.760]  We are not data scientists, we are desperate to have data which is complete and coherent.
[10:20.760 --> 10:23.760]  If it's dirty, it's a problem.
[10:23.760 --> 10:33.360]  If the semantics behind the data collection is somewhat inconsistent, it's a problem.
[10:33.360 --> 10:35.360]  If the information is missing, it's a problem.
[10:35.360 --> 10:41.120]  This may not be an issue for data scientists using statistical techniques or machine learning
[10:41.120 --> 10:47.160]  but it is for us.
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.760]  One issue that doesn't get much air play are data standards and quite a lot of the data
[10:51.760 --> 10:56.240]  standards in this area, especially in the electricity sector are proprietary, they come
[10:56.240 --> 11:04.200]  under so-called brand, we heard about that, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions.
[11:04.200 --> 11:12.760]  The problem is if the data standards are legally encumbered, then the code bases that reflect
[11:12.760 --> 11:21.000]  that and the data sets that comply with it could become derivative works under intellectual
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.800]  property law and we are in trouble.
[11:23.800 --> 11:34.160]  So we want basically CC by 4.0 or something similar on the data standards.
[11:34.160 --> 11:41.000]  I'll skip the last bit on data sets actually and I'll skip the slide but I just want to
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.040]  point out that the situation in Europe is pretty awful on a number of levels.
[11:47.040 --> 11:53.120]  You go to the US and you'll find a much friendlier environment for this kind of public interest
[11:53.120 --> 11:54.120]  information.
[11:54.120 --> 12:01.480]  Okay, second part of my talk is about the global south and the question is why is someone
[12:01.480 --> 12:07.960]  who's white, male and old standing here talking about the global south.
[12:07.960 --> 12:12.600]  My short answer is I'm from Aotearoa, New Zealand and New Zealand became bicultural
[12:12.600 --> 12:17.440]  all over my lifetime and I saw that process and contributed to it.
[12:17.440 --> 12:24.440]  I had radio programmes in the early 90s on sustainability and conservation on tribal
[12:24.440 --> 12:27.440]  radio, on ewe radio and so forth.
[12:27.440 --> 12:35.400]  I went to land occupations, I organised joint meetings with tribes, Huey they're called
[12:35.400 --> 12:37.240]  and they take place on Marae.
[12:37.240 --> 12:42.960]  So that's kind of my back story about why I can talk about this I think.
[12:42.960 --> 12:51.240]  This is a map of Africa with the high voltage network present and you will see that there
[12:51.240 --> 12:54.720]  is very little structure there.
[12:54.720 --> 13:03.160]  South Africa a little more, David is going to talk a little more about this so I won't.
[13:03.160 --> 13:09.280]  This is another example of a model called osmosis.
[13:09.280 --> 13:15.640]  This is in Africa and these are the cumulative trades out for the next 30 years.
[13:15.640 --> 13:20.520]  So this is the kind of thing that the models are starting to look at.
[13:20.520 --> 13:27.160]  There are two overarching projects in this area, the osmosis global project.
[13:27.160 --> 13:32.680]  Osmosis is written in a high level mathematical programming language called Mathprog.
[13:32.680 --> 13:37.400]  The second one is pipes and meets earth which is written in Python and you'll hear a little
[13:37.400 --> 13:38.400]  bit more about.
[13:38.400 --> 13:45.440]  One of the interesting things I thought, I looked up software heritage collects the
[13:45.440 --> 13:54.960]  forks for a particular code base and this is 135 fork repositories for osmosis and 308
[13:54.960 --> 13:58.120]  fork repositories for pipes.
[13:58.120 --> 14:03.360]  So that gives you an idea of how the open source world works when people will fork
[14:03.360 --> 14:04.360]  the project.
[14:04.360 --> 14:10.800]  These aren't hostile forks I presume and use them for their own work and hopefully contribute
[14:10.800 --> 14:15.240]  their contributions back upstream.
[14:15.240 --> 14:22.720]  This clear activity now in Central America, Costa Rica, South America, countries like
[14:22.720 --> 14:30.200]  Brazil, India and surrounding regions, South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and most of this
[14:30.200 --> 14:33.920]  is in the context of academic work.
[14:33.920 --> 14:40.960]  We have no connection or very little connection crossing over with the multilateral development
[14:40.960 --> 14:42.520]  organisations and so forth.
[14:42.520 --> 14:47.480]  So this is the parallel universe I mentioned.
[14:47.480 --> 14:52.480]  How we doing for time?
[14:52.480 --> 15:05.480]  One of the issues that we face I think is interacting with official agencies because
[15:05.480 --> 15:13.480]  we are relatively informal and relatively self-directed and we also are a competition
[15:13.480 --> 15:20.680]  against the agencies like the International Atomic Energy Agency or IRENA or whoever are
[15:20.680 --> 15:26.080]  doing their own analysis and I quite like this quote from Oliver Getten, every day politics
[15:26.080 --> 15:32.120]  is therefore dominated not by evidence based policy making but by attempts at policy based
[15:32.120 --> 15:37.480]  evidence making and that's exactly what we want to avoid.
[15:37.480 --> 15:42.240]  I talked to the incumbent NGOs about using our kind of analysis and they weren't very
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.320]  interested but I feel quite encouraged now because there are a new set of foundation
[15:46.320 --> 15:51.720]  backed think tanks who are actually very keen on this kind of stuff and I'm sorry I can't
[15:51.720 --> 15:56.640]  mention too many names because I was ill for the two weeks prior to this talk and I didn't
[15:56.640 --> 16:04.000]  get consent to talk about them but a couple of climate analytics and transition zero.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.480]  Some official agencies are starting to talk about open sourcing their stuff but they're
[16:07.480 --> 16:15.000]  not doing it in a particularly robust way in my opinion and this is a problem.
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.560]  They will either open wash or they will do what's called throw their code over the wall
[16:20.560 --> 16:24.680]  which is put it on GitHub but there's no attempt to develop it, there are no issues
[16:24.680 --> 16:32.680]  listed and whether it even runs is open to question.
[16:32.680 --> 16:40.880]  In regards working with the global south and as I had about 10 interviews with researchers
[16:40.880 --> 16:47.160]  in the global south to try and find out what scopes and issues they're unstructured interviews
[16:47.160 --> 16:51.080]  but it was kind of interesting.
[16:51.080 --> 16:59.960]  So the clear benefits of open source projects are of course few cost barriers with the caveat
[16:59.960 --> 17:04.560]  that the commercial solvers can be expensive.
[17:04.560 --> 17:14.440]  Open license for Garobi might equal three full time researchers in India for example.
[17:14.440 --> 17:23.440]  There's a soft technology transfer, it's bi-directional, it's lightweight, all the software projects
[17:23.440 --> 17:29.040]  bundle associated communities and this is I think really a useful part and the work
[17:29.040 --> 17:36.160]  is transparent, it can be studied and challenged which I think is really important.
[17:36.160 --> 17:43.840]  There are some cost cultural considerations I think that are necessary to explore and
[17:43.840 --> 17:52.480]  I talk about this in Aotearoa and New Zealand becoming bicultural but indigenous languages
[17:52.480 --> 17:59.880]  bundle different concepts and they're quite noticeably different, sovereignty is an issue,
[17:59.880 --> 18:08.480]  it's really easy to transgress sovereignty without realising it.
[18:08.480 --> 18:14.440]  There's a question of representation, the projects are all pretty much white and male
[18:14.440 --> 18:27.280]  and the global north at the moment and the next question really is also a matter to be
[18:27.280 --> 18:32.360]  traversed is that the framing of the models and the problems from a global north perspective
[18:32.360 --> 18:39.960]  may not be very appropriate to the circumstances in the global south.
[18:39.960 --> 18:49.120]  Global slide challenges, just overarching challenges, most of these won't be very surprising,
[18:49.120 --> 18:54.360]  code maintenance is always a challenge, support for maintainers.
[18:54.360 --> 19:00.120]  Building a suitable knowledge commons is going to be a real challenge, for instance the international
[19:00.120 --> 19:05.520]  energy agency only sells its data under non-disclosure, we don't get hold of that although it's collected
[19:05.520 --> 19:11.640]  from our national governments, the European Union is focused on data commodification through
[19:11.640 --> 19:21.440]  its single digital market, the scientific institutions are unnecessarily protective,
[19:21.440 --> 19:26.800]  I talked about cross cultural issues, we need to find new ways of interacting with official
[19:26.800 --> 19:33.320]  agencies to get any of this information into the policy process and I'll just conclude
[19:33.320 --> 19:39.640]  with a quotation from an East German playwright, Heinrich Müller, optimism is just a lack
[19:39.640 --> 19:56.960]  of information, okay that's it, thank you, yeah any questions, can you speak up a little
[19:56.960 --> 20:04.680]  too if you ask questions, maybe you said the European Union has some issues with open
[20:04.680 --> 20:11.560]  data, I know that the European Space Agency has really strong footprint on doing all this
[20:11.560 --> 20:17.880]  or is it Sentinel data, stuff maximum open to drive a new economy, so has this lot to
[20:17.880 --> 20:22.840]  spread to the other agencies yet, no the ones I'm going to mention and I will mention some
[20:22.840 --> 20:35.480]  names, the Meridata for climate, future climate is under bespoke license, the YASA data on
[20:35.480 --> 20:42.400]  scenarios going forward also under a bespoke license and so on, so a lot of the Horizon
[20:42.400 --> 20:52.360]  2020 projects are also problematic, the stuff under statute reporting is also legally encumbered,
[20:52.360 --> 21:00.440]  so I can't for the life of me understand why, but some of it is technically encumbered,
[21:00.440 --> 21:09.440]  so for example the transparency platform run by ENSOE is legally encumbered, the EEX data
[21:09.440 --> 21:19.160]  from the European energy exchange also and also technically encumbered, you can't cut
[21:19.160 --> 21:26.200]  and paste it off the website, it's not very deep protection but and we've complained my
[21:26.200 --> 21:31.240]  friends to ASA the regulator and they say it's compliant, sorry yeah.
[21:31.240 --> 21:56.120]  There's the open government license, UK 3.0, I don't know which one they're using,
[21:56.120 --> 22:02.640]  the other decent experience was with Elexon UK balancing, well I think I'm their only
[22:02.640 --> 22:08.840]  official licensee but other than that it told me to retract everything, I can use it completely
[22:08.840 --> 22:12.360]  open which is quite nice, so you know it can sometimes be.
[22:12.360 --> 22:16.760]  I just want to comment on licensing, the one that, the really the only license that works
[22:16.760 --> 22:25.520]  is CC by 4.0, if you go to the open government license UK 3.0 you'll find it's not interoperable
[22:25.520 --> 22:37.760]  with Creative Commons and so you end up with legal data silos, all the licenses are written
[22:37.760 --> 22:50.040]  by lawyers, I can assure you that and the lawyers all know what they're doing, okay okay okay,
[22:50.040 --> 23:04.880]  there's a question up there or no, yeah, yeah yeah, Remind went open, that's from Pic, went
[23:04.880 --> 23:12.920]  to one of the high GPL licenses, I filed a bug report on that because the GPL licenses
[23:12.920 --> 23:24.960]  have a clause on the, remember when Java was proprietary and you have to have an open
[23:24.960 --> 23:31.080]  language for a GPL license, they use GAMS which is not an open language and I filed
[23:31.080 --> 23:37.080]  a bug report and I know that personally the lawyer who responded who said it was okay,
[23:37.080 --> 23:43.640]  now look I'm not an open source lawyer, I didn't write the textbook but that was where
[23:43.640 --> 23:44.640]  that discussion went.
[23:44.640 --> 23:51.680]  Have you seen any new funding come into this particular field to open things up more, because
[23:51.680 --> 23:56.600]  all I know is that in December I know that the Creative Commons group, they've started,
[23:56.600 --> 24:01.160]  they've started to hire new roles in this specific role because they landed like a,
[24:01.160 --> 24:05.400]  you know small millions of Euros grant for this, but beyond that I don't know if there's,
[24:05.400 --> 24:09.160]  if you know any other groups starting to do stuff in this field.
[24:09.160 --> 24:18.920]  The overarching, okay, okay, yeah, thank you, oh sorry, the question was funding specifically
[24:18.920 --> 24:29.560]  for open source and the sort of short answer is, hang on, the short answer is that the
[24:29.560 --> 24:34.560]  funding, I'm talking about Germany let's say, has been quite good for modelling in general
[24:34.560 --> 24:38.920]  and it hasn't been specifically directed to open source.
[24:38.920 --> 24:43.920]  The high level organisation, the Open Energy Modelling Initiative hasn't needed resources
[24:43.920 --> 24:51.600]  as yet but what will happen going forward I don't know, but the funders are interested
[24:51.600 --> 24:58.480]  in the kind of open science component of what we do, that's quite clear and I presume that
[24:58.480 --> 25:05.440]  the next rounds of funding will start looking for real open source projects to be, to be
[25:05.440 --> 25:06.440]  for support.
[25:06.440 --> 25:07.440]  Yeah?
[25:07.440 --> 25:15.440]  So what would you say in all your years of experience has to change and how can we push
[25:15.440 --> 25:25.040]  for the change so that we get these open data, so what are the levels we have to pull?
[25:25.040 --> 25:33.000]  In a particular, well, the question was what levers are needed to come to genuinely open
[25:33.000 --> 25:39.480]  data, it depends on the jurisdiction, in the US it's quite good, federal, work by federal
[25:39.480 --> 25:46.760]  employees is public domain and there's been enough copyright, legislation around copyright
[25:46.760 --> 25:51.000]  that most of the stuff isn't actually covered, protected by copyright, they don't have
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.120]  a database directive.
[25:54.120 --> 26:02.920]  Working back to Europe, the only solution I can see is CC by 4.0 as a policy, which
[26:02.920 --> 26:07.960]  is lightweight, doesn't require legislation or change and so forth, but it does require
[26:07.960 --> 26:16.520]  the European Union to get out of the data commodification and I didn't mention it but
[26:16.520 --> 26:20.240]  there's a thing called the Data Producers Act which is still live which might come back
[26:20.240 --> 26:26.160]  into the data act, the proposed data act and that would be a complete travesty for us
[26:26.160 --> 26:31.400]  because that would mean all this machine generated data would now have its own intellectual
[26:31.400 --> 26:36.280]  property and I couldn't think of anything worse.
[26:36.280 --> 26:51.600]  Okay, yep, thank you everyone.
