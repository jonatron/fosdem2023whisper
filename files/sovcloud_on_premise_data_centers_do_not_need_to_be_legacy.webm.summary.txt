The speaker discusses the evolution of cloud computing and the importance of a good business model when implementing an on-premise data center. They suggest standardizing the interface between infrastructure and workload, using a bare metal container platform, and automating infrastructure pieces and configurations to keep costs down and maintain control. The speaker also recommends implementing multi-data center architecture and using tools like Open Cluster Management to manage clusters. The goal is to create a simple user experience that obstructs the complexity of infrastructure and maintain control for 10, 20, or 50 years.
