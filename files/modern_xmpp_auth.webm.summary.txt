The speaker, Matthew Wilde, discussed modernizing XMPP authentication and authorization, with a focus on introducing token-based authentication, which enables passwordless accounts and two-factor authentication in XMPP. Wilde explained how the fast token, an opaque random string of a good length for security reasons, can be used as an alternative to traditional password-based authentication, with the benefits of providing mutual authentication, supporting channel binding, and enabling two-factor authentication. Additionally, Wilde addressed security concerns with JSON web tokens and discussed efforts to standardize fast within the XMPP Standards Foundation and the IETF.
