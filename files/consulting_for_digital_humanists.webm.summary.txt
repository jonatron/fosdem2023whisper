The speaker, Marie Dubromé, gives a talk on the intersection between computer science and humanities, also known as digital humanities. As an engineer in digital humanities, Dubromé works to help humanists in their projects using technical expertise in computer science. The talk highlights the challenges faced in bringing together these two fields and promoting free software in digital humanities. Some of the obstacles include a lack of cohesion and common references, as well as a lack of visibility from the free software world towards humanists. However, Dubromé suggests that there are positive aspects such as the receptive audience and varied crowd in digital humanities, as well as the financial means to finance open source and free software. The talk ends with a Q&A section discussing ways to approach humanists who may need IT help in their projects.
