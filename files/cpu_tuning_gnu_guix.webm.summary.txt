In this talk, Ludovic Cortes talked about Geeks, a software deployment tool with a grand vision of building a tool for reproducible research and HPC. He discussed the concept of function multi-versioning and package multi-versioning, and how they are employed by Geeks to help users deploy software reproducibly. He argued that with Geeks, one can find the balance between performance and reproducibility, and still have portable performance.
