The speaker from SUSE presented an idea for building an image-based system using ButterFS by leveraging package-based technology. They proposed the use of snapshots instead of AP partitions, and the creation of an image as a list of RPMs on a text file, making it extendable by shipping additional RPMs locally. The RPM headers would be stored as files to make verification possible, and the user view of the system could be mapped into ButterFS subvolumes or even omitted with a fuse plugin. They provided a prototype using BusyBox, and outlined future challenges for making the system usable in practice. Q&A included discussions on the use of DM Verity root hash and the integration of verification technology.
