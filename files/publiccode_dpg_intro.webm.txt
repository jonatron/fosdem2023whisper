[00:00.000 --> 00:10.240]  Good morning, everyone. We're starting without slides because the projector isn't connected
[00:10.240 --> 00:14.800]  yet and we're going to keep trying to troubleshoot that. So thank you so much for coming. My
[00:14.800 --> 00:19.680]  name is Elena Finnedrecht. I'm here with the Foundation for Public Code. Welcome to
[00:19.680 --> 00:26.400]  the Public Code and Digital Public Goods Dev Room. I'm going to start with two really
[00:26.480 --> 00:31.040]  quick housekeeping things and then give a really fast pitch for the Foundation for Public Code,
[00:31.040 --> 00:37.440]  so you know why we're here. And then Veepal, who is my co-host from the Digital Public Goods
[00:37.440 --> 00:44.480]  Alliance, will give an intro to the Digital Public Goods Alliance. So as housekeeping,
[00:45.360 --> 00:50.240]  one, we're following Fossum's Code of Conduct here. Please be respectful while you're in the space.
[00:50.240 --> 00:54.640]  And two, I've opened some windows so that we have ventilation so that everyone can be comfortable
[00:54.640 --> 00:58.560]  being here. Please leave them open. I don't think it's a big issue about people closing them today.
[00:58.560 --> 01:03.920]  There's not very many of you. But yeah, but we'll leave them open throughout the session.
[01:04.800 --> 01:09.440]  So thank you for coming. We're delighted that you're here at our second Public Code Dev Room. Our
[01:09.440 --> 01:14.080]  first one was last year. It was online. This year, we're hosting it jointly with the Digital
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.880]  Public Goods Alliance because the Foundation for Public Code is proud that we're a Digital
[01:18.880 --> 01:24.800]  Public Goods Alliance member. And again, you'll hear more about what that means in a sec. And
[01:25.840 --> 01:29.520]  very importantly, because we believe that Public Code has the potential to make a significant
[01:29.520 --> 01:35.760]  contribution to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. So first, what is Public Code?
[01:37.440 --> 01:43.120]  Public Code is open source code that implements public policy. It's used for the public good,
[01:43.120 --> 01:47.040]  and it's used by public organizations like governments, public administrations, and
[01:47.680 --> 01:51.680]  state corporations. This morning, you'll hear more about two
[01:53.360 --> 01:58.880]  super interesting public code COVID-related projects. You'll hear about best practice for
[01:59.440 --> 02:03.360]  Digital Public Goods and Public Code, and about the policy environment in Europe.
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.880]  And so quite quickly, just an intro to who the Foundation for Public Code is.
[02:11.760 --> 02:18.160]  We're a non-profit founded in 2019 in Amsterdam. My slide would say that we provide tools and
[02:18.160 --> 02:23.120]  processes that bring people and institutions together to collaboratively build and maintain
[02:23.120 --> 02:29.520]  software as public infrastructure. My speaker notes, which would have complimented that slide,
[02:30.240 --> 02:33.520]  say that we exist because there's plenty of governments that are able to build
[02:33.520 --> 02:38.880]  public code code bases, but then they don't necessarily have the mandate to make the
[02:38.880 --> 02:43.840]  communities around those code bases thrive, to build actual public collaborations that ensure
[02:43.840 --> 02:51.520]  that the code bases are being reused, that they're growing, that they're living code bases.
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.960]  And so the Foundation for Public Code exists to help public code bases grow real sustainable
[02:56.960 --> 03:03.520]  communities so that the code bases are used in more than one place, and public organizations
[03:03.520 --> 03:09.920]  can actually benefit from the scaling potential of open source. Quickly, what do we do at the
[03:09.920 --> 03:14.880]  Foundation for Public Code? The most important thing we do is code-based stewardship,
[03:17.200 --> 03:21.120]  and our stewards take the role of a coach. They help to bring the most out of a community
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.000]  by helping, by giving the code base the best possible conditions to succeed. We do this by
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.800]  checking code quality, by organizing community events and helping the community thrive,
[03:33.520 --> 03:38.480]  for example, community calls, helping to develop the code base as a mature product,
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.040]  for example, by assisting with branding and communications around it, and developing training
[03:43.040 --> 03:49.680]  materials, and helping people who are implementing the code base, like vendors so that they can
[03:49.680 --> 03:54.000]  attract more people, they can help more organizations use the code base as well.
[03:54.960 --> 03:58.480]  The next thing we do is work on the standard for public code. There's copies there,
[04:00.320 --> 04:04.480]  and this is a set of criteria that supports public organizations in developing and maintaining
[04:04.480 --> 04:08.720]  software and policy together. It includes best practice guidance for policymakers, government
[04:08.720 --> 04:14.800]  administrators, developers, and vendors, and code bases that meet the standard are easy to
[04:14.800 --> 04:20.480]  collaborate on and to reuse. It's both fundamental for our own work, and it's a recognized digital
[04:20.480 --> 04:26.160]  public good. We recommend that as a resource for other digital public goods.
[04:26.880 --> 04:30.720]  And then finally, we do capacity building work for public organizations, like workshops and
[04:30.720 --> 04:40.320]  training, and an example of that is our governance game, which is an actual game, it's fun to play,
[04:40.320 --> 04:44.880]  but it lets people explore what's needed to govern a code base, what the various roles and
[04:44.880 --> 04:49.440]  complexities are in keeping code base governance balanced and flexible enough to be usable.
[04:50.720 --> 04:54.560]  And services issues worth considering during setup, and in the game context that includes
[04:54.560 --> 05:00.000]  things like Godzilla, but it also might include real things, so there's a rogue developer card,
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.200]  so what happens when you have somebody who doesn't follow the agreed governance.
[05:06.960 --> 05:11.360]  And so it's useful for visualizing how the current governance model is set up or how it could
[05:11.360 --> 05:17.680]  be changed as well. If you work with an ambitious public code base that might benefit from more
[05:17.680 --> 05:22.080]  support to grow internationally, or if any of our tools or approaches sound intriguing,
[05:22.080 --> 05:29.280]  come chat with me, or Kehinde, at one of the breaks. And that's us from the Foundation for
[05:29.280 --> 05:33.040]  Public Code. So on to people from the Digital Public Good Alliance.
[05:34.560 --> 05:37.840]  Of course, yeah. There we go. Thank you.
[05:42.640 --> 05:46.480]  So technical issues, people getting sick, it's all kind of thing going on right now.
[05:46.480 --> 05:51.280]  So sorry for the delays and sorry for all the things. Not as expected, like projector working
[05:51.280 --> 05:56.000]  for now, but I think it should be fixed. I just wanted to quickly run by what Digital Public
[05:56.000 --> 06:01.600]  Good is and Digital Public Good Alliance is. But before that, a quick short story, when COVID
[06:01.600 --> 06:07.520]  started, there's this tool called DHIS2, which was a Digital Public Good back there, and it was
[06:07.520 --> 06:14.400]  used in 76 countries, 73 countries, and it's a digital health, health metrics information
[06:14.400 --> 06:20.560]  collecting tool. And when the first COVID outbreak in Sri Lanka was recognized on January 27th of
[06:20.560 --> 06:27.280]  2020, within two days, the developer community of there were able to change it, modify to start
[06:27.280 --> 06:33.920]  tracking COVID patients coming from different highly contagious areas. And because of such
[06:33.920 --> 06:38.720]  fast work, in several next few days, it was deployed and started being used.
[06:39.680 --> 06:44.080]  That's not even the most impressive part. Within the next few weeks of that,
[06:44.800 --> 06:52.400]  it was already being adopted in 73 plus countries. And till now, it has located and counted and tracked
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.280]  3.8 billion people, which is 40% of the world population.
[06:59.600 --> 07:05.840]  And all of it was possible because it has open licenses. It had a community around it,
[07:06.480 --> 07:09.280]  and it was targeting a critical need that the world needed.
[07:11.680 --> 07:16.400]  In Digital Public Goods Alliance, we call these things called Digital Public Good, obviously.
[07:17.520 --> 07:24.080]  These are open source technologies or content, software, data models, it could be anything,
[07:24.880 --> 07:33.360]  which follows and adheres relevant best practices, do not harm, and advances the UN's
[07:33.360 --> 07:37.840]  Sustainable Development Goals. So these three are the heart of what we call Digital Public Good.
[07:38.720 --> 07:47.840]  Later on, when expanded, it has nine indicators from proper licensing, documentation, not collecting
[07:47.840 --> 07:55.040]  PII's information, must be platform independent, so you should not be dependent on a proprietary
[07:55.040 --> 08:00.560]  solution that can prevent you from further scaling up. And all of these nine indicators
[08:00.560 --> 08:06.800]  help us nominate and decide Digital Public Good. Very easy to nominate a software.
[08:07.840 --> 08:12.800]  If you have a link, SubmissionStartDigitalPublicGood.net, you go there, you nominate your project,
[08:13.520 --> 08:17.760]  there will be a technical review of it, and once done, it's recognized on the registry.
[08:18.800 --> 08:25.200]  Today, we have recognized 127 public goods, and it's continuously increasing at faster rate than ever.
[08:30.720 --> 08:36.400]  So DPGA, started by UNICEF, the government of Norway,
[08:37.200 --> 08:44.000]  government of Sierra Leone, and ISPRIT. At this point, we have a lot more organizations together
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.160]  with it, and if you attended the keynote yesterday, the fresh announcement is Open Source Initiative
[08:50.160 --> 08:58.960]  is also in the DPGA, in the Alliance now. We have Bill and Belinda Gates Foundation, Github, UNDP,
[08:59.920 --> 09:07.120]  USAID, and a lot more. It's a multi-stakeholder alliance founded by UNICEF and others,
[09:07.760 --> 09:14.640]  but today DPGA has expanded a lot. And the advantage of being certified, you have discoverability.
[09:14.640 --> 09:20.000]  If your tool is there, it's easy to discover for a lot of people to identify, well, not just
[09:20.000 --> 09:27.120]  contribution, but to adapt it for their critical need, support for usability, and deployment capacity,
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.200]  because there are pathfinder countries who will work with you to adapt that solution and utilize
[09:33.200 --> 09:40.240]  them. Within UNICEF, we also have programs, DPGA accelerator programs, where we'll take a DPGA
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.760]  digital public good solution and try to pilot it in countries where it can be actually used for good.
[09:47.840 --> 09:53.680]  Just wanted to keep it short, because we are running late, and again at 1040 or 1050,
[09:53.680 --> 09:57.360]  I have my talk where we'll again refresh this thing in maybe more details.
[09:58.400 --> 10:03.920]  But you can go to digitalpublicgood.net, read more about us, what we do, and you can submit
[10:03.920 --> 10:09.040]  your solutions at submissions.digitalpublicgood.net. That's me, and thank you for coming today.
[10:09.040 --> 10:17.040]  And I think we have projectors fixed, so for the next talk, we can start giving up.
