Christopher Peters presented on Grotto Center, an open-access global database created to link information about caves and caving phenomena. Originally developed in France and now managed by the European Caving Federation and International Caving Federation, the database uses W3C Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies to enable easy access for humans and API access for machines. The project is supported by caving clubs and associations, as well as interns from several universities.
