{"text": " What I wanted to talk with you today is about how to identify networks inside the guest itself, because there are in some cases where there is a problem, we want to define a network and inside the guest we don't know to where we are connected exactly, so this is the talk. My name is Eddie, I am working at Red Hat today on a project called Kuvert, I think there was a talk here about it before. Let's see, has anyone worked with Kuvert or knows it? This is a very, very quick, does anyone know about Kubernetes? Kubernetes is everyone else, so Kubernetes is the baseline, I would say, so it has, if you know it, it has something called pods, it's like the smallest part of it, in pods there we run containers, now if we want to work with virtual machines then we can install Kuvert, it's an add-on to Kubernetes, this is more or less how it looks, Kubernetes is like a management system and Kuvert is an add-on to this management system that manages VMs, it does this using LiveVirt and KMU and everything KMU runs inside the pod and the pod runs the guest and they share the same network, this is one of their, why we created it on Kuvert or on Kubernetes is to share the same network, so we can expand the pods or we can work with VMs when we are not able to work with pods. So in the regular or the classic way to run a virtual machine is we usually have one network and it's called usually ETH0, if anyone raised the VM this is what they will get, but if you want to have multiple networks then we have a little problem because we can have ETH0, ETH1, ETH2 and we can continue on like that and the main problem with it is that this is not assured, like if you do a reboot to the machine the next time it boots it does not have to be the same order, so you could have ETH0 connected to some red network and the next reboot it will be called ETH1 and it will be connected to the blue network and the reason for that is that the scheme of ETHN is based on the detection of the device while the operations system boots, so it can detect it, it's like it's random, it doesn't have to be the same order, so what can we do about it, so I guess the most direct way to handle something like that is from the management system, in our case it's COVID but we can do that in any management system, from the management system we can pass information inside the guest and tell it to what you are connected to, what are these networks exactly, so we're going to go over each option and see what they are, so the way to configure COVID is very similar to how we configure Kubernetes, we have an object and in this object we configure the parameters, I just took a snippet of the networking parts because this is what we don't want to get into too many details, so in the definition of virtual machine instance we define the interface that it should have and the interfaces have the masquerade and the bridge that you see, these are actually two interfaces, the masquerade and the bridge is the binding way, we don't need to talk about it in this talk but what is important here that this is like a classic way, this is the default thing to define two things, it will use the default ethn in this case you will see, so when we define these two if we go into the guest we'll see eth0 and eth1, if this is like for the explanation we can go inside the pod that was created for us, where the virtual machine runs actually, where Kimo runs or Livvitt runs and we can do a commander to see the configuration of the virtual machine from inside, something that usually the user doesn't see, it's hidden from the user but this is done just to show you, when we create with Livvitt a virtual machine even if we don't pass the information it will automatically create a MAC addresses for each nick and it will create also PCI addresses, it's something done by Livvitt automatically if we don't specify anything, so we can see that the MAC addresses correspond with the MAC address inside the guest and the PCI address in this case it depends on operation system that you run inside of it, for example this one I think it's Fedora, so Fedora gives us this eth0 stuff but it also gives us some alternative name which was calculated in this case based on the PCI address, the problem with we can, the problem that we cannot identify this to the original configuration is that if we look here we never specified anything, so this is we will need to do to connect to the pod and check what it has and then it's not practical, so it doesn't help me much, so the first thing that we could do is to specify the MAC address in the configuration, if we specify specific MAC address this MAC address is going to be placed inside what we saw Livvitt in the configuration, this is what Kuvert will do and then we can see the MAC address inside the guest, the problem with this one is that we cannot, we will need to use, we cannot use the same MAC address for each interface right even between virtual machines because then they will collide and will have no network, so this is not so good solution and we should, we need to find some other better solution and by the way this also collides the, in Kuvert for example we have a MAC pool which automatically, I mean it's an option but it allocates MAC addresses to interfaces so they will not collide, so we will not have a case where MAC address was defined twice. So the better solution for all of this is to use something that Linux has started working exposed like I think it's a lot of years ago, like 10 years maybe if I don't know, it's called predictable network device names, instead of using the ETH and this is the last one, we can decode the name of the interface based on the something called an ACPI device index, we'll talk about it soon, based either or by the PCI address of the device, so if we specify the PCI address of the device when we define the interface it will go the operation system, if it uses system D and things like that it can create the interface based on this name. So this is a, I'm showing you here what we can do, the ACPI index is the parameter that we can set inside the definition of the virtual machine and it will go, it will create the, it will pass it to Livid and Livid will create the domain, the VM and then we will see it with this name, it starts with ENO and then the ID that we set here, but even if the operation system does not know to do it, because if you don't use system D I think it will not do that, someone needs to know to name the interface correctly, you can still go to, I don't have, I cannot show you now because it's not my laptop, but you can do a CIS bus, you can go on the bus of the PCI address and the last one will be an ACPI index value, so you can read it from there. Now the other option, this is, by the way this is the, I guess the best option if you can do it. The second best one is to define a PCI address, specific PCI address when you define the interface, it's a bit harder just because you need to know which PCI address to use and you need to manage it, so if you create 10 interfaces you don't want them to collide and you don't want them to collide with other devices of your virtual machine like, I don't know, a sound device or something else, so this is a bit harder, but you can do it and if you set that one the name of the interface will be created using E&P and then the first number is the bus number, this is this one here and the slot is this one. Yeah, but there is one problem with all of this, what I just said is that I don't know if you ever try to use a virtual machine from the cloud that you downloaded, one of the problems that all the images that are created for us Fedora ones, the Centos ones, Ubuntu ones, all of them have something they expect to have only one interface, so they are configured in a way, so they will not use all of these schemes, so they will, they want, I mean, if you want to have this scheme or these options, you just cannot have it, it disables them in purpose and the reason is because they are saying, if I want to run an application inside the guest, I want it to be, to know always that it is ETH0, I don't want it to give me a name that is random, that I cannot control, so if someone wants to use these naming schemes, they need to go to the VM, prepare an image or they need to tweak the existing image and enable this predictable naming. The last option, which is a bit more complicated, but it gives us more options, is we can have a tag on the interface, specify a tag and it will use something that was invented in OpenStack actually, that's called device role tagging and what this one does, it prepares the information, like it reads, when we set tag for them, you will see that we will get, we'll get this information, it doesn't touch the interfaces, it doesn't touch the interfaces, it just mounts inside the guest data, which is this one for example, and this data is the one that was read from Livid configuration, so it reads, if I put FOSSDEM as a tag, then what Kuvert is doing, it reads the Livid configuration, checks what is the, it reads the address of the PCI, the MAC address and puts the tag and a potential application or guest inside the, inside the guest, they can read this file and decide which network to connect to. This is, we could do much more interesting stuff with this one, although it's not, it's less standardized because using the name of the NIC sounds to me at least more, using the simple solutions or more standard one, this one is, you need to learn about this protocol, so you need to mount it and you need to read it and decode it, but you can do things like here, we could tag different devices like the NUMA device and some other peripheral device and then tag them on the same tag and then use this information to do for the application inside of it to use smart things, like for example, an easy way to run an application and use the devices that are on the same NUMA, that's one example you could do. I don't, I cannot do the demo, but if someone wants to look how, what they need to configure in the virtual machine, the guest, so the naming will be not ETHN, then please come to me. All the art is for my kids, so I must write it down, that's it I guess, any questions? No, yes. Yes, you'll need to use the PCI, I guess, or maybe there is a, oh sorry, I need to repeat the question. So, yeah, we were asked about what to do when we use the guest that is ARM, right, using ARM and the ACPI index is not available, so yes, in this case you must use the PCI, but if we have maybe other, other identifiers, maybe you can use them. There is one identifier that I didn't say here, I didn't talk about it, it's very similar to the ACPI index, but it's a register on the, on the PCI, so we can, we can use that if you want, but I think Livid or Kimo is not supporting that here. Yes. Any more questions? Last question? Yes. So, ACPI I think index, sorry, I'm not good at repeating, the question was what about operations that are not Linux? It doesn't exist, but the real answer is that ACPI index, I think it's supposed to be generic, I mean it's part of the, it's like a standard of the ACPI, so if, for example, Windows or some embedded thing can read the device, then it can fetch the information, the ACPI index information, and they can always use the PCI address, and if there is something, if there is, if you, the fact with the tag, for example, that is universal, if you can mount something inside the guest, and like this one is working using cloud in it. So, if we don't have time, so if someone has questions, please come to me, I'll stay here, or outside, I'll stay here.
