The speaker discusses proper ways to draw Kubernetes clusters due to their complexity with many entities interacting with each other. They emphasize the importance of creating good and simple drawings to reduce cognitive load for consumers. The speaker gives examples of black and white diagrams, using shades of gray and colors, and recommends using a color wheel for good contrast. They suggest using rectangles with rounded corners to reduce stress caused by angular icons, mixing official Kubernetes icons with other icons if needed, and creating several simple drawings instead of one complicated one.
