The speaker, Tobin, gives a talk about a security consideration in the confidential containers community that also applies to other confidential computing projects. The main issue discussed is the ability of a malicious virtual machine to manufacture a valid attestation report, potentially leading to unauthorized access to secrets from any key broker service (KBS). The speaker explains the various solutions that can be implemented to prevent this attack, such as revoking access to attestation reports, using the host data field to bind hardware evidence to a specific KBS, or using signature validation. The speaker also discusses the implications and challenges of these solutions and highlights the importance of protecting the ability to generate valid evidence.
