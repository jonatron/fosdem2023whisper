The speakers are from Siemens and are part of the Phosology community, which is an open source license compliance project. Phosology is a Linux application that scans source code to identify licenses, copyrights, authorships, and other relevant statements before generating documentation and reports. It also has export and import of SPDX files. They recently updated their releases and synced their license set with the SPDX license set for GDPR updates and improvements to their REST API. They are currently compliant with the export and display of the reused.software standard, and they are working on compliance with the SBDX IDF format. There is a Q&A session at the end discussing the formats that Phosology supports and how custom license texts can be included in SBDX files.
