{"text": " Good morning, so my name is Yomov Noi, I work on Debian among other things, and today I'm going to talk about some things I've been working on to automate changes to Debian packaging. The talk is specifically about Debian, but hopefully some of the lessons are applicable to other distributions as well. Debian hopefully doesn't need a lot of introduction, but set the scene a little bit, so hopefully you're all familiar with Debian distributions. Debian distributions are system integrators, and they're sort of a spectrum in terms of how much work various distributions do to integrate, and Debian definitely falls on sort of the far side of the spectrum there, so there's quite a lot of work that happens in order to turn an upstream package into a Debian package. There's work going on to have the various packages work together very well, a lot of extra metadata, as opposed to some other distributions, like for example Nix, that are just a very, very thin wrapper around an upstream project. That does mean that there's more work involved in the Debian package, and it's also more likely to require more work when for example a new upstream release comes out, but a lot of the work that is involved here relates to that. Debian has about 1,000 developers, about 30,000 source packages overall, and the way that Debian has traditionally worked is each package has a single person associated with it. Over time we sort of move to a model in which there's teams that maintain large sets of packages, but there is still a very clear owner for each of the packages, which means that depending on the package there are different guidelines and different policies that you have to take into account. You can just modify whatever package you want. There's the Debian policy, which mandates some things around packages, but if you want to say a random Haskell package, there's a Haskell package policy, and there's a particular group of people who maintain the various Haskell packages, so if you're not a part of that group you need to get one of them to review your changes. Traditionally Debian packages have all been just sort of tarballs. The source packages have just been tarballs with a Debian directory and a couple of Debian specific files in those, and those tarballs get shipped around and an archive is made up out of a bunch of those tarballs, and potentially of the binary packages that get built from those tarballs. And those tarballs are generally GBT-signed. So that's sort of how Debian has traditionally worked over the last, I guess, 15 years. The ecosystem has evolved, so fortunately we're now using Git for a lot of the packages, not for all of them, so there's no mandate whatsoever within Debian that packages have to be in Git, and upstream packages have also moved to Git, which is great. As a sort of, I've worked on version control systems before, and as a version control geek I'm a little bit sad that we have a monoculture now, but it's really nice that there's a single version control system that you have to deal with, rather than sort of like a plethora, which makes it really hard if you're packaging to interact with all of the different systems. And there is, in Debian, no formal requirement that you have to maintain your packages on our Git hosting sites also, but the vast majority of packages are on that site. There's also packages that are hosted on people's individual Git servers, or on GitHub, or wherever, and there's a header in the packages that allows you to declare where packages are located. And this is a graph of sort of trends overall within Debian. You can also declare, or you could also declare other version control systems, and over time you can see that the big red bar at the bottom is packages that don't use a version control system at all, and the big sort of brown yellowy bit is Git, and then there's a bunch of other version control systems which you can see like gradually lose popularity. But all of this means that you can now, for the vast majority of packages, find the Git URL that's associated, make a change, and hopefully create a merge proposal, which is an improvement over downloading a tarball of the latest uploads to Debian, creating a patch and attaching that to a bug report, which both requires more work on your parts. It might mean that your changes are against a version of the package that has changed by the maintainer since the last upload, and it's also less work on part of the maintainer. And then there's a bunch of other things that have changed, so there's more metadata now on where the upstream is located, so we have an extra control file now that basically says like this is where the upstream Git repository is, which makes it easier to, for example, pull in a Git snapshot from the upstream repository, or in theory, and I don't think we actually use this for anything yet, like report bugs in the upstream bug tracker and stuff like that automatically. And this particular file is still a draft proposal, but about like a third of the packages in Debian already have this file, and there's some tooling as well that can automatically generate this based on other metadata that exists in the upstream repository like DOAP files or some build files. And then one of the other changes in the last couple of years has been the broad adoption of proper gate packages to the stable releases. And then finally, we used to have a sort of a white plethora of like build tools in Debian, and over the last couple of years we sort of converged on a single build tool, and that also makes it a lot easier to make changes across the archive, like you don't have to first figure out what the build tool is that's being used and how the particular change that you want to make is done in that particular build tool. And this is the graph of sort of the adoption of the, I guess, DWIM, DAP helper over time. And so traditionally in Debian, and then, like this is an example, a particular control file contains a carriage line feed, because we don't have a monorepo, you then sort of wait for all of the maintainers to run the tools to gradually make changes and like over the course of five years everybody maybe makes that change, and the problem is fixed. Yeah, so this is an example of like a control file containing a carriage line feed. There is actually a command in there that describes what you need to run in order to fix this, but everybody has to go and sort of like run this tool, get the suggestion, run the commands, do an upload of the package, so that can take quite a while. So yeah, this is the sort of what I was describing, like it can take quite long to actually get through this and it requires quite a bit of attention from like a large set of people who all have to learn a little bit about this particular problem, have to run this command, have to do all of this work. So like, yeah, this is slow and it takes a lot of time across Debian developers. Like I said, there was this command that was mentioned there. We could just automate running that, like rather than having a command tell you what you should run, we could just do it for you. And that's basically the idea behind the tool called Lenship Brush. So it takes sort of a quarter of the and it has a bit of cleverness to sort of work out where the problem is and whether it can solve it with enough confidence and then it just makes the changes. And it preserves as much of the rest of the packaging as it can, so it won't like completely reformat the entire package and things like that. And yeah, this is sort of an example. I won't go into it too deeply, but basically, like this is changing the section of the package because one of the, or sorry, the priorities of the package because one of the priorities was deprecated. But then there's an adoption challenge here as well because now everybody has to install this particular tool and has to run it regularly on each of the packages they touch. And yeah, as you can see, like this is a graph of the popcorn, the number of people who have Lenship Brush installed and you can see that by like 2021, it's about 140. So it's not the vast majority of developers. So we can take a step further and say like what if we just go out and discover all of the Git repositories and we just run this tool on the repository for them and we just create a merge browser. So that's the idea behind the tool called Silver Platter. And yeah, so that basically just automates that whole process. But then somebody has to go in and like manually do this regularly. So now if we take another step, build a cloud service that basically does this regularly for all of the packages within Debian. And that is called Debian Generator. So it basically just scrapes all of the VCS Git fields, finds the ones that are on hosting sites that it supports. So it's either GitLab or GitHub or Launchpads and it runs Lenship Brush on them. And then this is sort of what it's the kinds of things that it does. I don't think the diff is particularly readable. You can see it's a relatively trivial change. In this case it's like fixing actually a VCS Git header and some build depends. But it's also a change that like would take somebody at least a couple of minutes to make and verify and stuff like that. And this tool also provides a way to do QA in all of the changes. So it will have a human review the diff at least. But it will also do a build of the package with the changes. We'll do a build of the package without the changes. And it will look at the diff between the binary output as well. In particular to see if like anything. In particular like there's some teams in Debian that maintain like 3,000, 4,000 packages. And it sort of works like TCP slow start. So it will send out one pull request to a maintainer. If they merge that they'll get another two pull requests. If they merge those they'll get another four, et cetera. So like it goes exponentially. But if they close the first pull request they won't get any more. So it's sort of meant to like if people are interested in engaging they'll get all the pull requests they want if they don't care. Or for example if they've got their own workflows, if they run an engine brush themselves, they won't be spammed with like lots of pull requests. And we monitor the pull requests for comments by humans. So it's not just a black box that's like sent you lots and lots of pull requests. If you leave a comment on a pull request because you have concerns, we'll have a look at the comments and for example make changes. And yeah, there's some risks here though. Like for example the slow start that I mentioned is one of the things that we built into not get people into a mood where they'll basically ignore these pull requests because they're low quality or because they're spammy or whatever. And like we're really trying to sort of save developers time and improve the archive. But we don't want sort of another distraction that they now have to deal with or that annoys them in which case they might like completely ignore things. So there are a couple of principles that we try to follow. We don't make any sort of experimental changes. We only make changes that we think that we have very high confidence are correct. If we don't have enough confidence, we'll just like not make the change at all. Like a human can always come by and make the change. And then we try to provide as much context for the developers as we can. So like we'll do a build without the changes and a build with the changes and we'll give them the binary depth as well. And usually that's only like a line or two. But normally you would have to like manually do those builds if you were making the change yourself. And this is something that we can provide so we should. And yeah, we try to listen as much as possible to like feedback. Yeah, I think I've already mentioned this sort of like we try really hard to be conservative in what would change. It's in particular very easy to sort of like make a particular change across a large number of packages and have people turn off and go like, yeah, this thing just sends me incorrect changes. So I'm going to completely ignore it. Yeah, so what has this done so far? We've at this point processed most of the Debian archive. Unfortunately, we lost a bunch of the data with the graphs. But I've got some old graphs where you can basically see its progress. We're at sort of the, I think it's around 25,000 mark at this point. So these were direct pushes to repositories and these are merge proposals. And so you can see in green the open merge proposals and in blue the, sorry, in blue the open merge proposals and in green the merged proposals. And there's sort of some trans visible where like at some point somebody in one of the teams that maintains like all the 5000 pro packages decides that they're going to merge a bunch of merge proposals and you get like a spike both in terms of like merged and also in terms of open merge proposals. Yeah, and then there are a bunch of challenges around this as well. So a lot of packages are still not hosted in Git as you saw from one of the earlier graphs. But there's also a lot of packages that are hosted on Git servers that no longer exist. So there was a Debian hosting site called Aliath before Salsa and there's still a lot of packages that sort of declare that they're hosted there. And nobody has really bothered updating the headers or in some cases hasn't uploaded the packages since we migrated. But there's also a bunch of packages that still declare that they're hosted on Subversion while the Subversion server has long been turned down. So yeah, there isn't really any good way of dealing with those. And then for packages that are not yet on Salsa, like we have to maybe figure out something else to do. So either we could try and encourage people to maybe migrate to Git or maybe we could actually generate patches and attach those to bug reports. But there's a lot of sort of challenges around that as well because then you have to make sure that the patch stays up to date. And maybe you want to have a different threshold for when you actually file a patch because there's a lot more work involved with actually applying and uploading that. And there's a lot of merge proposals that actually sit idle. So one of the ways in which GitLab works is if you are a member of a team that owns a lot of repositories, you don't get any notifications when people open pull requests. So a lot of pull requests just sit there idle unless people actively subscribe to changes. Yeah, I'll skip over this because I'm a little bit short on time. I've so far just introduced the sort of small changes that we can make with Lengine fixes. There's a bunch of other kinds of changes that we're making as well, in particular merging new upstream releases, doing backports to older Debian releases, cleaning up some of the older, the other fields in the control files, so in particular like packages that have been orphans, updating the headers to reflect that, people who have retired from the projects, removing them from the uploaders and maintaining the fields, and some other cleanups. That was it. Thanks for listening. All of this is sort of a thin wrapper on top of a bunch of other infrastructure that has been built in Debian over the last couple of years. So these are some of the other services that it's based on. And here's some more links if you're interested. Any questions? Yep. So the question was, could this help companies who currently skip sort of proper packaging? Yes, skip packaging can just make very haphazard big containers or just deploy by copying stuff around. Would you recommend them proper packaging with this tooling? I think sort of what I was getting at the beginning of the talk, like there are probably other distributions that allow you to do like a much thinner wrapper around the upstream that are probably more appropriate for that, because if you do a Debian package, there's quite a lot of extra information you have to add to get to a full Debian package that meets the Debian policy. And if you don't want to invest a lot in the packaging, a Debian package is probably, it's quite a lot of investments, even with more tooling. Like this isn't going to write your package description for you. Maybe it needs integration with chat tpt, but like, we're not there yet. When you make a change, do you have one lint rule per PR or how do you bundle them? Sorry. When you make a PR, is there like one lint rule per PR or do you combine multiple text in one PR? So it varies a little bit per campaign. For these things, like these small really like one line changes, I combine them. And I also revisit the PRs regularly and then it'll just add new commits to the existing PR. So yeah, you won't get spammed with like 10 things for 10 tiny changes. Thanks. I had a question. Say, we have a similar system in Fedora project called Packet, which helps automating packages in DNF as well as RPM. Say, what involves over there is making releases and the change log is picked from releases that's on GitHub or GitHub or wherever that is hosted. Do you plan on making something like that happen, you know, pushing updates to the packages based on the releases made on their Git repositories? Yes, this does actually do that. It's not one of the things I talked about, but it's one of the sort of other campaigns.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.200000000000001, "text": " Good morning, so my name is Yomov Noi, I work on Debian among other things, and today I'm", "tokens": [50364, 2205, 2446, 11, 370, 452, 1315, 307, 398, 298, 5179, 883, 72, 11, 286, 589, 322, 1346, 20196, 3654, 661, 721, 11, 293, 965, 286, 478, 50924], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2943619400707643, "compression_ratio": 1.471264367816092, "no_speech_prob": 0.20979426801204681}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 11.200000000000001, "end": 17.400000000000002, "text": " going to talk about some things I've been working on to automate changes to Debian", "tokens": [50924, 516, 281, 751, 466, 512, 721, 286, 600, 668, 1364, 322, 281, 31605, 2962, 281, 1346, 20196, 51234], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2943619400707643, "compression_ratio": 1.471264367816092, "no_speech_prob": 0.20979426801204681}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 17.400000000000002, "end": 22.56, "text": " packaging.
