Damien presented a project called SDK with Zen, which focuses on the storage visualization part of the supervisor. The project aims to use the screen here in place of the current storage protocol to reduce the cost of transferring block storage requests from a virtual machine to a storage platform. They propose using SPDK to directly transmit block requests to reduce the cost, and the implementation aims to improve storage stack performance in a transparent manner for VM without impacting users. They are currently relying on NVMe, which is pretty much everywhere, to use SPDK, but they want to look at improving the grantable interface for modern-day computing. During the Q&A, Damien clarified that SPDK is not hard to install, and their implementation can survive the crash of the SPDK process.
