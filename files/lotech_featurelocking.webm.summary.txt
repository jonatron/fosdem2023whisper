 

This talk describes a feature developed by Pranam, which allows for the restriction and locking of certain features for the benefit of a CIS Admin. The restriction and locking of the feature is enabled by setting a "switcher" in WSTXML, allowing the CIS Admin to restrict or hide certain features, or to lock a feature so that the user must pay for it. The talk concluded with an example of how the feature looks when in-use.
