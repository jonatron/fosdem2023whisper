{"text": " Okay, so hi everyone. Thank you for making it. I'm David. I'm the project lead on the Crip Pad team, part of X-Wiki. And so today I'm going to give you a little summary of what Crip Pad is and what we're looking at for the year ahead. But first, I want to give a little bit of context. What context are we working in? I think we're in a particular moment when it comes to online collaboration. I'm going to take education as an example, but I think the broad strokes of what's happening is applying to many other sectors. So last May, Human Rights Watch released a report where they found that 90% of education tech software was spying on students or had the potential to spy on students. And of course, a lot of this is linked to the COVID crisis. So don't get me wrong, this didn't just spring out of nowhere when COVID happened. A lot of it was kind of waiting in the wings. But studies such as this one on the zoomification of universities really show the kind of drastic shifts in adoption in terms of online collaborative software that happened around COVID. And also highlights real concerns, in this case about the impact on academic freedom, the concerns that are raised when universities become reliant on cloud providers, especially like Big Tech, cloud providers. I personally know a lot of people in academia and basically since COVID, a lot of people just live in Microsoft Teams now. So that's an issue. I'm not going to go too deep into it, but Privacy International is watching this space and especially in the ad tech sector, I think this is really worth watching. So at the moment, we're at this point where big entities such as governments, so in France, for example, where we're based, the education ministry is as it's back against the wall in a way because they're forced to, you know, they can't keep recommending that people flock to Big Tech in the kind of early panic of COVID. And so they're not, they're advising against it. But I guess the big question is, what now? You know, where do you go now? How do you replace these tools? Where collaboration has proven to be, there's a need for some kind of collaborative software solution. But obviously, all the concerns linked with these solutions being provided by Big Tech giants are really becoming apparent and harder to ignore now that these situations are kind of normalized. And the issue is that collaboration often comes at the price of privacy, right? So you have these, on one side, these solutions that are very good at providing collaboration. Some of them are, you know, big evil tech corpse like we've seen. Some others are maybe less evil, maybe more open source, etc. But yeah, typically not very good at privacy. On the other hand, you have very good solutions that provide encrypted storage and personal note-taking, for example, but that are typically not great at collaborative work. Okay, and so at CripPad, we think, or our project exists because we think we should be able to have both. So the collaboration and privacy shouldn't be mutually exclusive, basically. So we exist in that overlap in the Venn diagram. And so what we provide is basically an online collaborative office suite with a lot of features that you'd come to expect from such a thing. So you have a drive where you can store documents. We have a full suite of applications, all of which are collaborative in real time. So that means different people can be editing the same document at the same time and see each other as cursors and things like this. So we have spreadsheets, text documents, forms, Kanban boards, plain text, markdown documents. So some of these are integrations of other open source software. So we integrate only office frontends, for example, and others are made from scratch. So for example, our forms application we developed from the ground up. We have a lot of collaborative features. So some of the drive that I showed, this could also be a team drive where a few people have access to the same set of folders and we have granular kind of access controls as to who can see what, etc. We have calendars, sharing capabilities. So with contacts on the platform, but also with the ability to produce links that you can then share to your friends so you can all edit the same set of notes, for example. And the real unique feature behind all of this is that everything is end-to-end encrypted. So basically everything happens in your browser and your browser encrypts and decrypts all the messages that you send to the server that's centralizing the collaborative element. Okay, so nothing leaves your device unencrypted is the basic kind of feature but also constraint that we have. Okay, so I'm going to do a little tour of what's kind of currently on our minds. I have to put in a disclaimer that a lot is in flux at the moment. We're in the process of setting up potentially big partnerships and stuff but nothing is kind of fully finalized. So I'm not going to give any names and I'm not going to promise that everything I'm going to show today is going to actually be implemented this year and maybe some other stuff that I have no idea about yet will be implemented instead. So this is just what's currently on our mind as of February 2023. So one thing that's definitely underway is a project called CripPad Blueprints where we're thoroughly documenting the use of cryptography as we currently use it so that it's more transparent, our threat model is open, etc. And so that we can also pave the way for future developments. So Theo who's sitting here in the front row is leading this effort. He's just given a talk in the security dev room if you want to catch up on that later on and he's also just released a white paper as the first step in this project. There are some interesting experiments in the kind of looking ahead part of this project that are coming up. We're going to experiment with CRDTs so we're testing like a very experimental prototype with using YGS as a way of syncing the edits between different users and we're also looking into how we could implement perfect for its secrecy. At the moment when you join a document you also gain access to its history which in some cases could be problematic so we want to have a way of limiting the access to the history to the moment that you join for example and we want to have also better ways of recovering your accounts. At the moment the typical support email that we get is I forgot my password and we can't do anything in that case unfortunately because otherwise we would have access to people's documents but there are ways of doing this in a slightly better way when it comes to usability. So we want to look at this. This is funded by Next Generation Internet by the way who also have a presence here so I encourage to look them up. Another project we're doing with the help of their funding at the moment is CripPad Auth so this is also secured. We are looking at different ways of improving authentication on CripPad so we're going to look at ways to speak to integrate with existing single sign-on scheme. So say if a company already has a single sign-on system then CripPad should be able to be part of that and also looking at multi-factor authentication. Now this time last year I was presenting the results here at FOSDEM of our inter-office project. This is a project where we basically developed document conversion between different office formats and because of the constraints I was speaking earlier this cannot happen on the server because our server doesn't know anything so it had to happen in the client and that was slightly complicated but we did it and with this we were able to complete our integration of the only office editors so we also released the presentation and text document editors at the time. However we're still having quite a few issues with them we've not been able to stabilize them as much as we'd like so we're still seeing some bugs and we're not quite able to reproduce them so a big priority for us this year will be to stabilize these two apps at the moment on our flagship instance CripPad.fr they're limited to paying users just simply because we needed a way of limiting the amount of support tickets we're going to get so one of the big goals this year is to stabilize these two apps and release them for everyone. Mind you the I mean they are still open source right so if you're a self hosting an instance you already have access to these. Another thing we're looking at is to integrate a new application so draw.io or diagrams.net that editor should make its way into CripPad this year so collaborative diagram editing is very exciting. We just heard about the relentless march of markdown and one thing that we're looking at as well is to improve markdown use in CripPad but to improve we already have great support for markdown we have two applications so our code editor has great markdown support with lots of extensions and we also have a markdown slides application where you can write slide decks in markdown I know this is a slightly niche feature but I'm guessing this is probably the case where the niche is probably most active where coders are used to like write slides in markdown I personally like it but these two apps are really underused like hardly anyone knows about them in case of in the case of CripPad so I think to do justice to them we're going to try and merge them into a single app and we're going to call this notes again kind of going out on the limb here but something that's not code or something that doesn't suggest that it's only for editing kind of programs because that's not the case so yeah we're imagining something at the moment with basically a markdown editor with different modes so if you want to do slides you can just switch the mode in the single app so beyond kind of these different EU funded projects and the partnerships we're setting up we've been thinking also about how to make our project financially sustainable because we can't go on research grants forever and so basically we've identified these three broad segments in our user base which are enterprise nonprofits and education and right now we're trying to cater to these three kind of broad use cases not necessarily trying to get everyone on CripPad.fr but thinking more at the instance level and encouraging and advertising the possibility for bigger entities such as universities, bigger NGOs, small and medium or large enterprise to have their own instance of the product so that they could manage their own domain sorry or that they or we could manage for them as in like support contracts etc that would be you know maybe slightly customized to their branding etc so we're exploring this as a potential revenue source for stabilizing the or like you know making the project financially viable basically long term so this is some pricing that we've just launched on our project site so the self hosting and the code remains free obviously everything remains open source and then we have the existing way of subscribing to use CripPad is kind of personal and organizational accounts on CripPad.fr and now we're adding this managed instance possibility which is still in very early stages but yeah we're looking to see where that goes basically in the year ahead so one thing before closing I want to draw your attention to our new forum that was launched last October I want to encourage you if you have feedback feature requests even bug requests and you don't use github then please come to our forum submit you know start a thread about something that you care about and we'll respond and hopefully maybe some other community members will respond I want to give a big shout out to the team because obviously I'm not on my own we started this this time last year we were three people and now we're six in the core team so we're growing rapidly and a lot of things are happening and hopefully very exciting things on the near horizon this is it from me I want to encourage you to go to CripPad.org where you can find all relevant links to where to contact us the new pricing I've mentioned and everything else to get in touch or to read our documentation and try out CripPad for yourself thank you very much and I welcome your questions you have a question yes yes yes so yes one of the one of the things that we're oh yes sorry so I didn't talk about an API that we're developing which is called open with CripPad although we're kind of reluctant to use this name because in some cases it could imply that you're benefiting from the encryption when you would not be but so yes this is an API that we're developing at the moment that other host platforms could use basically CripPad application just as an editor okay so you have a file a markdown file or a document stored in NextCloud and you could open it for a collaborative session in a CripPad encrypted collaborative session and then once it's saved you save back to NextCloud or you know NextCloud or any other kind of host platform with a CripPad instance a lightweight CripPad instance running alongside it why are we reluctant to use open with CripPad for this or not reluctant but we're thinking about what to call it is that CripPad comes with a promise of privacy and in this case we only control the privacy while the the collaborative session is open so yeah that's that's an issue but yes potentially some exciting development in that front that would allow more people to integrate with us yeah yeah a question about the concept of zero trust because zero trust and and encryption based based on that you can validate or verify that the client is really enter and encrypting your data but as this is a web app is there any way to verify that the server delivers the code that is really end-to-end encrypting or in the end do I have to trust the server that is really delivering the code so how can you be sure that the code that you're getting from the server is really the right I'm repeating your question for the the right code and that there is no kind of malicious action on the server part is that your question so Theo's talk is called whom do you trust it was in the security bedroom earlier so he will have a lot more detail on this I think the short answer to it is that you can't really be sure of it but there are ways that we are exploring in terms of verifying for example that the code on the server is matching a certain repository but this is not implemented at the moment so you have to trust that the yes that the server is really delivering the same code that we publish on github for example run your own server yeah that's yes the back yes hi so a lot of freedom fighters and activists are starting to use this question one is this advisable and question two is if you allow me in the mountains a lot of commercial encryption phones providers for criminals actually got busted over the last two years these were for drug criminals and so on people planning murders on that are there any contingency plans for this so to your first question is it advisable for activists to use script pad I guess is your question I would say yes Theo reminded us earlier of the case of Disha Ravi who is an Indian climate activist who basically got doxxed by Google to New Delhi police and that resulted in her arrest so I think yes it's beneficial if you want to avoid scenarios like this and I think especially so when you're involved in this kind of organizing I think it's about protecting yourself but also protecting whoever else you're dragging into your movement right so we've seen a few cases where you know a document is shared quite widely and you know you see these uses of Google docs where it's about sharing resources or even gathering resources etc so this is not just protecting yourself as an activist but also all the people who are visiting your document right so I think yeah there is there is precedent here where you know big tech companies are more than happy to out people and I think as we see the tightening of the definition of like what's acceptable activism and especially around the climate movement I think yes I would advise for it uh your second question was about encrypted phones and contingency plans for criminal uses of the software basically so we administer kripa.fr which is the flagship instance and I think these plans are really at this level at the instance admin level and so I can only speak to what we do on kripa.fr and we're actively monitoring for you know criminal uses of the the platform and whenever something is reported to us or whenever we find something we're like actively searching then we take down you know anything we found we find our our experiences that at some point most of these endeavors end up you know having to recruit or having to basically you know publish a link to something on the platform so that's when that's when these things become groups or whatever become visible and then we can act on them could that answer your question we have one question at the back yes can you please tell us something more about the distribution in France and how it's actually welcomed by school and how it's actually functioned so starting the presentation yes so what's the adoption of kripa in response to the the recent recommendation not to use big tech platforms in education in France so nothing as far as I'm aware we have we're not aware of any schools using or having adopted kripa as a result of these recommendations be aware we're talking like this was two months ago or something or like it's fairly recent we see a lot of adoption in Germany and this was even before this kind of recent developments so we have a lot of testimonials from schools and universities that are using kripa in in Germany and we seem to have a lot more traction on the german market than we do in France so this is something that we're looking to improve on the front side we're hoping to get for example there is a catalog of apps for the education national which we're working to get onto that kind of um suite that is deployable by schools we're not there yet but this is something that's um on our radar yes they're interested they need it they need the whole thing in particular right which is very important for that type of deployment it's a bit complicated it's not a no-to-deployment by school so it's not instances it's basically a very very big instances they have they have on their application another type of path simple one there is somebody from national education tomorrow in another room go see him and tell him that you want it so thank you then we have one more last question okay yes okay uh you told us a quick quick path is a entrance from user to uh yes so you have no access to the copy of the users yes uh it says basically say it for actually just to use it and then you told us that uh you monitor the flagship uh instance yes lawful or unlawful users illegal yeah that's a kind of a vector on how you monitor the encrypted data for lawful or unlawful users oh no sorry sorry uh so uh contradiction between um i said that we that i would recommend activists to use crip pad and also that we were monitoring for criminal uses what i mean but what i mean by monitoring is look is uh you know o-center like scanning the internet for crip pad links not that we can monitor anything as administrators of the platform does that make sense we search we don't we don't see encrypted data but if somebody if somebody sends us a link with encryption key because it was perfect a link to a document we will delete it potentially and we would report it if we if we have to report and if uh and if we see that it's bluntly criminal we would potentially even close the account and delete the data because we have some links between the data we wouldn't be able to read the data because we cannot see the data but we would delete it and i'd like to add on this we had one police request in the year and it was clearly illegal what they sent us we sent them what what we have which was close to nothing like very little information only what we see in the pads basically uh but so we're not seeing any data clearly we're not seeing the data but some people post links that's why the police if they see the computer they will find a lot of links on the computer links to crip pad documents we can continue this if you want but i think there was a misunderstanding with my use of actively monitoring public so uh if if something is posted on the thank you very much", "segments": [{"id": 0,
