The talk is about using Kotlin multiplatform without reflection, as Kotlin JS and Kotlin Native do not support reflection. The solution proposed is to use Kotlin Poet and KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing API) to generate code at compile time, allowing for the creation of mirrors which contain reflection information of another class. A detailed example of how this can be done using KSP is given, with the emphasis on using mock AMP, a testing library that generates mocks at compile time. The talk concludes by promoting the use of Kotlin multiplatform and open source contributions, as well as offering Kotlin multiplatform training through coding coders.
