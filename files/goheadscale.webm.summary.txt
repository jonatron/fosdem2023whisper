The talk was about the development of Headscale, an open source version of Talescale. The speakers discussed how they used integration testing to reimplement the control panel or server of Talescale. They shared their experiences with reverse engineering the Talescale clients, identifying and fixing issues with the code, and the importance of integration testing in maintaining compatibility with third-party clients and accepting contributions from external developers. They also mentioned their plans for future improvements and provided information on how to reach them for further discussions.
