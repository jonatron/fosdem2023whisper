The talk is about the Somik project by Fortanix that aims to overcome limitations of the Nitro Enclaves platform by adding networking capabilities and persistent storage for confidential program execution in a safe environment. The project uses a Docker image that runs on a VM with Nitro Enclave enabled and provides an internal parent and enclave part that communicate through the VSOC connection. The file system solution is presented using block devices and encryption with dmcrypt and emberty tools to maintain integrity protection and data persistence. The talk does not provide information about performance implications or comparisons with other platforms.
