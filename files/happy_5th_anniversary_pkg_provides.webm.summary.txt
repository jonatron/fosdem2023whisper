The talk is about a plugin called package provides for FreeBSD, which helps in finding which package to install to have a specific file in one's computer by searching for the packages that provide that file. The plugin uses a database containing a full list of files that can be installed. The talk covers the motivations behind creating the plugin, how the database was built, and its uses - including identifying unexpected files in packages and searching for duplicate files. The talk ends with a Q&A session.
