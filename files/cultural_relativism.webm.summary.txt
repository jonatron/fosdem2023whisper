The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 discussed cultural relativism as a prism for constructing cross-cultural communities. The speaker, Claude Warren, explained that culture is learned behavior and influences how individuals perceive and interpret the world. Cultural relativism, which was first defined by Herodotus and popularized by Franz Boas, is the idea that beliefs and practices can only be understood within the context of their respective cultures. The talk emphasized the importance of cultural relativism in managing cross-cultural teams, as it helps identify and address potential misunderstandings and conflicts. Warren shared examples of cultural differences that could impact communication and collaboration, such as the perception of color, time, and gestures. He also shared strategies for creating a culturally sensitive and inclusive project culture, including making it safe to fail, encouraging disagreement, and fostering open dialogue. The talk highlighted the need for ongoing learning and understanding of cultural differences in order to foster successful cross-cultural collaboration.
