00:00.000 --> 00:11.840
So, hi everyone, my name is Mathieu Tasse, I'm a software engineer and this talk is about

00:11.840 --> 00:17.240
a retrospective of my last year when it comes to hardware development.

00:17.240 --> 00:22.560
So my background is that I do a lot of C programming, I've been doing so for the last

00:22.560 --> 00:31.280
10 years, kernel drivers, libraries, mostly on Linux, so with Yocto, all of that mostly

00:31.280 --> 00:38.960
for profit because you get to make a living and I've also been hacking on more fun stuff

00:38.960 --> 00:49.400
like guide, new geeks, functional stuff for fun this time and to me up to last year hardware

00:49.400 --> 00:55.720
was more or less like a black box, I mean I was familiar with the surface of the box

00:55.720 --> 01:04.280
which are data sheets, manuals, schematics, but what's inside of it wasn't that interesting

01:04.280 --> 01:13.160
to me if I had something harder than finding out a GPIO number or any kind of trouble,

01:13.160 --> 01:23.680
I found my hardware colleague, dropped the ball and moved on, but last year almost randomly

01:23.680 --> 01:29.800
I discovered the world of hardware repair and micro soldering on YouTube and it's a

01:29.800 --> 01:35.680
fun world, there are some really really talented people which are repairing some stuff, they

01:35.680 --> 01:43.280
are finding the one tiny capacitor that is failing, removing it and just by buying some

01:43.280 --> 01:53.120
1001 cent capacitor you are fixing a burden, I found that quite interesting and I think

01:53.120 --> 02:00.040
that the world would be really different maybe in 20, 30 years and having this kind of tool

02:00.040 --> 02:08.560
set could be interesting and at the same time I had a project where I was involved in the

02:08.560 --> 02:19.560
design of a motherboard for an Intel CPU and the hardware guy was a bit busy, I was somehow

02:19.560 --> 02:28.960
against my will involved in the hardware selection and so I learned that it's more or less picking

02:28.960 --> 02:36.080
out ICs which means integrated circuits, it's like often a tiny black box and you have to

02:36.080 --> 02:42.400
pick one, you have to pick one that is not out of stock and it's challenging these times

02:42.400 --> 02:49.240
and once you pick two or some that maybe will ship then you need to draw the wires between

02:49.240 --> 02:56.640
them and it was quite a fun exercise and it gave me the motivation to acquire some tools

02:56.640 --> 03:01.080
because one of the difference between software and hardware is that with software, well you

03:01.080 --> 03:06.560
can have your laptop and work everywhere, with hardware my experience is that it's not

03:06.560 --> 03:12.280
only that you need some tools, it's that you need all the tools, like if you don't have

03:12.280 --> 03:19.160
everything you will still have something missing and you'll be oh no and so this is about how

03:19.160 --> 03:25.400
to turn your desk into a terrible mess, so first you need to buy a microscope, you don't

03:25.400 --> 03:33.560
need a times 5000 zoom, 540 is way than enough, you need some LED lightening so that you're

03:33.560 --> 03:41.120
able to see what's under that and it's quite a fun exercise to learn to solder on the microscope

03:41.120 --> 03:46.240
and it's a nice tool to use, then you need obviously a soldering iron, most of you are

03:46.240 --> 03:51.360
familiar with it, you need a hot air station, it's maybe even more important than the soldering

03:51.360 --> 04:00.240
iron, you use that to desolder some ICs, the tiny black things, we solder them, but it's

04:00.240 --> 04:04.760
difficult to manage because it's blowing 400 degrees air so it's easy to mess everything

04:04.760 --> 04:11.600
and burn your board, you need a generator to power your board, you need an oscilloscope

04:11.600 --> 04:24.080
to be able to see your signals, you need also a breadboard so that you're able to experiment,

04:24.080 --> 04:32.040
try out some things, you need some components, some resistors, some capacitors, some inductances,

04:32.040 --> 04:35.880
as I said it's nice to have all of those so that when you are trying out something you

04:35.880 --> 04:41.720
don't need to wait for two weeks, five weeks to experiment, you need a multimeter, you

04:41.720 --> 04:46.520
don't need a fancy one, it's like a two UUOS multimeter, the main function is that when

04:46.520 --> 04:53.560
you connect the probes it beeps and you can, it sounds funny but with that you can reverse

04:53.560 --> 05:06.440
engineer some tiny circuits, you can isolate some issues, you can do a lot of stuff.

05:06.440 --> 05:15.400
You need some flux so that the solder is able to flow nicely, it's probably very toxic

05:15.400 --> 05:25.440
and as healthy as like eating lead for breakfast so maybe you also need some kind of fume extractor,

05:25.440 --> 05:32.360
I need to improve mine because you need also some solder wick or solder pump so that you're

05:32.360 --> 05:39.080
able to remove the solder when you have made some mistakes, you need some tweezers and

05:39.080 --> 05:46.160
more than that you need to use them because when you are dealing with O4 or 2 components

05:46.160 --> 05:52.920
they like to jump to the end of the room so quite a fun exercise, you need a puff board

05:52.920 --> 06:00.800
so that once you have a circuit on your breadboard you can make it more permanent, you need some

06:00.800 --> 06:06.640
wires to wire things obviously, if you have a two dollar multimeter then you probably also

06:06.640 --> 06:16.160
need an RLC meter so that you are able to find the values of your components and last

06:16.160 --> 06:23.920
of all I felt like I needed, I have a software engineer, I did some hardware at school but

06:23.920 --> 06:28.720
not so much and I felt like I needed some kind of reference book and when it comes to software

06:28.720 --> 06:34.800
to me it's like it's SICP structured and interpretation of computer programs, it feels

06:34.800 --> 06:40.640
to me like a novel, it's like a Stephen King novel, I can relate, I felt so entertaining

06:40.640 --> 06:48.560
and I can use what's the reference book for hardware, people tell me it's the art of electronics

06:48.560 --> 06:55.160
so I can just say that it's a whole different deal here, to me at least, like reading more

06:55.160 --> 07:00.600
than two or three pages gives me like horrible headaches but it's a reference book, you will

07:00.600 --> 07:11.400
find some more in-depth explanations on electronics like overflow and what, and when I acquired

07:11.400 --> 07:16.840
all that equipment I tried to design some easy circuits so this one is a flash programming

07:16.840 --> 07:23.360
device on a pervboard so that you are able to put your IC on the socket on the left hand

07:23.360 --> 07:29.320
corner and then able to flash it with flash run, that was my third circuit then I managed

07:29.320 --> 07:37.160
to make a few reapers, I had a 0% success rate for like three months, then I did hit

07:37.160 --> 07:46.920
2% success rate by fixing my coffee machine but since then I managed to fix quite a few

07:46.920 --> 07:54.640
things, I also managed to hack a BIOS, it was a nice thing, I had a laptop with password

07:54.640 --> 08:02.800
protected BIOS, I tried to remove the BIOS which is the DIC there, I burnt it to ashes,

08:02.800 --> 08:08.640
I burnt another one that I still burnt to ashes, about the third one, I flashed it with

08:08.640 --> 08:15.640
the device you saw with flash run, put BIOS without the password, managed to solder it

08:15.640 --> 08:22.760
back on with the hot station I thought about, then it wasn't working because I also managed

08:22.760 --> 08:29.040
to blue some copper traces then I had to run some wires but at the end the notebook booted

08:29.040 --> 08:39.320
and it's not much but it was quite a success to me, then finally I did try to get into

08:39.320 --> 08:46.560
PCB design so I have a led ribbon around my desk and I tried to make it like remote controllable

08:46.560 --> 08:52.000
so I designed the PCB it's like the worst use case you can ever think of but you get

08:52.000 --> 09:00.440
to start somewhere so I designed a PCB on QCAD with a CPU that was really fun to solder,

09:00.440 --> 09:11.800
a regulator, a USB port, nothing fancy, I found QCAD really fun to use, I mean it was easy

09:11.800 --> 09:16.920
to draw the schematics to make the routing even without any experience, I mean really

09:16.920 --> 09:27.640
nice software, I tried LibroCAD for my next design because the name sounds appealing but

09:27.640 --> 09:33.800
it was quite an interesting process, yeah that's it so the takeaway message is that

09:33.800 --> 09:38.960
even if you are 100% software engineer and you don't want to get into hardware having

09:38.960 --> 09:45.000
a minimal set of equipment and minimal set of knowledge allows you to do some fun stuff

09:45.000 --> 09:53.040
and try to connect you to your hardware colleagues which is a good thing in my opinion, so thank

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
you.

09:54.040 --> 10:18.040
Okay, thank you Matthew.
