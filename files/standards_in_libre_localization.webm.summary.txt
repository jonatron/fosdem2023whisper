Benjamin Jamie gave a talk at FOSDEM about the need for a standard in Libra localization and how to make it easy for translators to contribute to any FOSS project they like. He talked about the origin of WebLate and how it became a widely-used platform for localization, but acknowledged that there are still many projects in the Libre world that are not using it. He proposed the idea of creating a federated platform or file that could index readme or translation files from different repositories, making it easy for translators to find the right place to localize their favorite software. He invited the audience to join the discussion and share their ideas about this possible tool or file.
