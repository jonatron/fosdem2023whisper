00:00.000 --> 00:11.440
So, hello everyone. I'm glad to be here. I am Etienne Combe. I am a researcher at

00:11.440 --> 00:17.480
Gustave Eiffel University and I will talk about a site project that I have from

00:17.480 --> 00:23.900
the right time ago and try to tell the story of this site project with

00:23.900 --> 00:31.360
concern web mapping and statistical data and how quickly how the OpenStreetMap

00:31.360 --> 00:41.000
stack have changed the way we show and diffuse statistical data. Okay, so this is

00:41.000 --> 00:46.280
a background that I will skip and I will go back in time eight years ago. I was

00:46.280 --> 00:51.560
on a project and I was working on a massive graded statistical data set

00:51.560 --> 00:59.320
that are called DonÃ© Caroyer in French and this data are derived from tax sheets

00:59.320 --> 01:08.160
and they are given at a very detailed spatial scale so pixels of 200 meters by

01:08.160 --> 01:17.240
200 meters on all the French territories and you have several variables

01:17.240 --> 01:26.600
like population structures, number of people under 10 above 17 and so on and

01:26.600 --> 01:33.680
you have also information about the revenue of the people and this data set

01:33.680 --> 01:39.440
reached the statistical limit of statistical secrets so in some of the

01:39.440 --> 01:46.360
pixels are less than 11 households so the data are aggregated in order to be

01:46.360 --> 01:52.960
above this threshold which is forced by the law. Okay, so the more precise data

01:52.960 --> 02:01.800
set that we may have on the French population. Okay, and the distribution

02:01.800 --> 02:07.960
of this data set at this time was like this so the first step was to go on the

02:07.960 --> 02:15.400
INSEE website, find this page. It was already quite hard because it was in a

02:15.400 --> 02:22.160
very deep part of the website and you have to download two files in a very

02:22.160 --> 02:28.720
specific file format like DBF and MIFMID which were coming from a map

02:28.720 --> 02:34.600
and for software so a G software from the 80s and you have to deal with that.

02:34.600 --> 02:43.200
Okay, so not very easy. You already have a QGIS way to read that so

02:43.200 --> 02:47.680
there is already an open source software to read the data but the

02:47.680 --> 02:55.800
exploration was not very easy and and friendly. Okay, so this is the help page

02:55.800 --> 03:02.200
to read the data, load them in QGIS and so on but if you are not a G

03:02.200 --> 03:10.440
specialist it was quite difficult to deal with that. Okay, and I was working

03:10.440 --> 03:16.040
with my student on this data set and at the end of the thesis we had the

03:16.040 --> 03:22.320
idea to try to improve a little bit that and we seen an

03:22.320 --> 03:28.560
opportunity. So the context I have already given, EV file, tricky file

03:28.560 --> 03:35.160
format and also projection problem in the data set at this time, usable with a

03:35.160 --> 03:43.960
lot of pain and with dedicated software like map info, ArcGIS or QGIS and the

03:43.960 --> 03:49.320
opportunity that we have seen at this time was the web mapping stacks that was

03:49.320 --> 03:56.960
developed around the OSM project. So open layer was already there, leaflet

03:56.960 --> 04:06.000
also and mapbox tools were also on the rise with at this time this was a timing

04:06.000 --> 04:16.600
platform that allowed to build custom map web maps. Okay, and we had

04:16.600 --> 04:21.040
seconds that this will allow to renew the data diffusion visualization

04:21.040 --> 04:29.680
approaches. Okay, we were not alone, Oliver O'Brien in UK did a quite similar

04:29.680 --> 04:41.440
proposal in 2015 with DataShine, this is a screen of DataShine at this time

04:41.440 --> 04:52.240
which was built using open layer and he had to build one stack of tags for each

04:52.240 --> 04:59.360
features he wanted to be visible on the map. So in all of this interface you may

04:59.360 --> 05:08.520
choose between several features, so more than 50, less than 10, the revenue or so

05:08.520 --> 05:19.120
on and he had to build all these these tags, so a lot of work. And at the

05:19.120 --> 05:23.400
same time there was a technology that was coming which is called

05:23.400 --> 05:29.080
vector tags, so the tags that were used to build the map are no more images but

05:29.080 --> 05:39.320
are vector file format solutions. So it was the very beginning of this

05:39.320 --> 05:48.520
this approach and I have recovered some of the first tech notes about some

05:48.520 --> 05:55.600
solution from the open source community about vector tags and for

05:55.600 --> 05:59.920
statistical data this was a massive advantage because you may put all

05:59.920 --> 06:05.560
the data in the tag and adapt the visualization on the front end and you

06:05.560 --> 06:10.720
did not have to produce one tag set for every feature, so it was very

06:10.720 --> 06:17.800
advantageous and very interesting and we tried to build something around that

06:17.800 --> 06:23.040
and the tools were not existing completely at this time, so the first

06:23.040 --> 06:28.080
toolchain was something like some earth creep to process the data and export

06:28.080 --> 06:36.280
vector tags in geogizon format, a leaflet map to draw the map and a

06:36.280 --> 06:42.560
detroit hook to render the vector tags on the canvas and to animate all this.

06:42.560 --> 06:51.160
And some tricks to try something with interactivity because if you draw

06:51.160 --> 06:55.760
something on canvas it's not so easy to know on which part of the map you are

06:55.760 --> 07:01.920
and we try to to put some some some love in the details about the color

07:01.920 --> 07:10.840
scales, some background on the labels and the data that were produced by the

07:10.840 --> 07:20.320
French administration were square, so there is one well-known problem with

07:20.320 --> 07:25.280
statistical data, special statistical data which is called a modifiable

07:25.280 --> 07:30.680
area unit problem which says that when you change the regression levels you

07:30.680 --> 07:38.080
will see different things and you may find different patterns and we see that

07:38.080 --> 07:46.160
this can be an opportunity in fact and we will try to aggregate the raw data

07:46.160 --> 07:51.080
at different scales and link these scales with the zoom levels, so this will solve

07:51.080 --> 07:57.640
two problems we need to keep the vector tags a little bit small because we are

07:57.640 --> 08:05.120
on the web so we didn't want to download 10 mega and so on so this will be

08:05.120 --> 08:12.440
solved by the aggregations and because of the mob we want to explore several

08:12.440 --> 08:18.600
aggregation scales so this was a possibility that were interesting so

08:18.600 --> 08:31.600
this first solution is still is still usable 8 years ago and it's it's already

08:31.600 --> 08:41.320
cool so you have a map you may zoom you may look for a place and so on and you

08:41.320 --> 08:46.960
may find a precise location you may switch the features that you want to

08:46.960 --> 08:53.560
look at and you didn't have to download the big file open a g software and it's

08:53.560 --> 09:04.400
quite more easy okay so this was the first the first project and we get some

09:04.400 --> 09:11.680
feedbacks from the INSEE so we are speaking with the producer of the data also

09:11.680 --> 09:16.160
from journalists some journalists who are interested on specific topics and

09:16.160 --> 09:20.960
use the tools for example to to study segregations on school or

09:20.960 --> 09:28.480
districting your banis also use some of the your banis use that for territorial

09:28.480 --> 09:35.200
diagnosis transportation researcher and curious people so it was it was cool and

09:35.200 --> 09:44.160
since this first this first version the technology have quite maturated and

09:44.160 --> 09:55.600
there is now a very standard way to to to to to deliver vector types which is a

09:55.600 --> 10:03.520
MVT format mapbox vector tiles with specifications and pogeys one on

10:03.520 --> 10:10.160
database can produce this type of vector types and there is also new front end

10:10.160 --> 10:17.200
solutions like mapbox gel which is now no more in open source but the open source

10:17.200 --> 10:25.720
project is used by my trip now and that's that's also we have we have a new

10:25.720 --> 10:34.160
toolchain and some successors and if you have questions and if you have if you

10:34.160 --> 10:50.480
want details about some of these successors it will be a pleasure

10:50.480 --> 11:07.080
it's how you split so the question was about vector ties on the meaning of

11:07.080 --> 11:13.960
vector ties so when mapping is based on the pyramid of ties and when you zoom a

11:13.960 --> 11:34.520
tie is a twill in French yes but it's because in web mapping so to draw the

11:34.520 --> 11:40.200
map you have to to build ties that are arranged in a pyramid and when you zoom

11:40.200 --> 11:45.000
you download only the part of the of the zoom level that is

11:45.000 --> 11:54.720
concerned by the current view so it's too it's too no it's just to optimize the

11:54.720 --> 12:00.000
usage of the bond which and to to send only the relevant part of the data to

12:00.000 --> 12:25.720
the front end during during the exploration of the of the map from

12:25.720 --> 12:37.280
INSEE so just for INSEE they are trying to to to build something similar but from

12:37.280 --> 12:44.920
some time now and it's still not not online okay so I have a working on a

12:44.920 --> 12:50.800
prototype for them okay so as the next version of the of the solution was

12:50.800 --> 13:05.640
built with with INSEE and and they they didn't have sufficiently people inside

13:05.640 --> 13:12.160
to to to deal with this type of project I think but it's still not there but if

13:12.160 --> 13:18.160
you look at that I shine so almost the same project with with similar tools

13:18.160 --> 13:26.280
and in the UK that I shine is now available in in for for the census of

13:26.280 --> 13:32.240
the UK it's it's a new version of that I shine that is used okay so I have some

13:32.240 --> 13:39.640
hope that at one point in time we will have an official portai in INSEE that

13:39.640 --> 13:57.760
will look like that but still not yes but not in the web mapping exploration

13:57.760 --> 14:05.120
tools for everybody but I had one versions for for your buddies for

14:05.120 --> 14:12.800
examples where they can upload their own shapefives to to to add more layers of

14:12.800 --> 14:29.000
your information yes there is European initiative I have forgotten the name but

14:29.000 --> 14:35.760
it's it's all derived from the in spear directive which gives some guidelines

14:35.760 --> 14:41.200
for our delivering a statistical that has a special statistical dataset and there

14:41.200 --> 14:52.480
is also a library from euro stat which is called right this I didn't have with so

14:52.480 --> 14:56.960
you may find the links but there is a JavaScript library now which is

14:56.960 --> 15:05.760
developed by euro stat to show graded data statistical data
