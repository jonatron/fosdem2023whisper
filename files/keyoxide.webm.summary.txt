Jarma Makenbach presented a non-technical introduction to her project called K-Oxide, which focuses on verifying online identities through cryptography. K-Oxide is designed to offer secure, verifiable, and self-sovereign identity verification that is anonymous and decentralized, allowing individuals to have multiple online identities that do not necessarily match their real-life identity. The project utilizes cryptographic keys and bidirectional verification to ensure the identity is verified. K-Oxide is currently accessible through a mobile app, and the team intends to add more services and expand the functionality of the project to explore new ways of using identities online.
