WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello, you all, morning creatures. Good morning. We're about to start the talks of the day

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
and I'll leave you with Tobias Augspurge, who will be talking about how open source

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
can leverage more sustainability in the technology. So welcome, welcome.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
Yeah, welcome also from my side. So I'm actually working in atmospheric science.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
So by education, I'm an aerospace engineer. I'm in my day job calibrating satellite instruments

00:41.000 --> 00:53.000
for atmospheric science. But let's say in my private time, I do this professional hobby,

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
so I'm actually investigating with some other people how does open source can have a significant impact

01:01.000 --> 01:11.000
on environmental sustainability. And we created this project within a small community called Prototypes

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
that is actually investigating multiple ways how to increase the sustainability of our environment

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
open source projects. And this project was started with a friend of mine and me about

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
two and a half years ago within a pandemic. So we had a lot of time and we realized, okay,

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
there's actually no overview about what open source really means in environmental sustainability.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
And so we started to create a huge list, an awesome list. I think you know what this is.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
That actually lists all projects that we can find in this domain. And quite soon,

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
Irene joined this project because she did a similar development four years ago.

01:59.000 --> 02:07.000
And we were thinking about, okay, we created now this huge list and let's make a study about this.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
How can we quantify and how can we also find quantitative ways to investigate what actually

02:15.000 --> 02:24.000
open source means in environmental sustainability. So Irene was actually funded by SUBAC,

02:24.000 --> 02:34.000
that is an accelerator program to open up data in climate. And after that,

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
Josh Hopkins from Open Corridor joined us. He is interested to integrate multiple of the projects

02:41.000 --> 02:50.000
we investigated in a larger software project also for environmental sustainability.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
So what does environmental sustainability in general means? It is actually the goal

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
to preserve the natural resources that we all depend on for future generations.

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
But what does it actually require? So it requires the intelligent intention to understand,

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
predict and manage the stability of our natural resources. And that means that you need to

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
understand that actually we depend on nature and the natural resources that have been created

03:25.000 --> 03:36.000
over a million of years by the nature itself and the natural earth systems that we see here.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
For example, you see here on the right hand side an atmospheric simulation by the open

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
source project called SCREAM. They are investigating how does the content of water vapor

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
change and how does water vapor actually change the climate in the future when our earth is

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
heating up because when the earth is heating up, more water vapor will be in the atmosphere.

04:00.000 --> 04:09.000
And this is a huge problem because it actually accelerates climate itself because water vapor

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
is itself a greenhouse gas. So we see there an actually accelerating process and software

04:16.000 --> 04:26.000
is there very important to actually predict and to understand how this will be in the future.

04:26.000 --> 04:34.000
So the core question of the study and analysis that we did is what enables open source software

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
and environmental sustainability? So I think you know that open source is now dominating

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
our software industries worldwide and there are studies from synopsis that shows that actually

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
in 79% of the code bases worldwide you can find open source code and they did it because

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
they do security auditing and they look into the code and they see okay we find it everywhere

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
and it impacts all our software that we depend on worldwide. So what we did in our study is

05:07.000 --> 05:15.000
we started with the state. So what is actually the state of this ecosystem? And we created

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
by multiple insights but we also wanted to derive some principles based on the multiple

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
projects we investigated and interviews and people we talked to. But we also wanted to

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
create some visions. So what are actually opportunities? What are strategies? What is the

05:34.000 --> 05:46.000
potential that we are missing that actually open source delivers us in environmental sustainability?

05:46.000 --> 05:55.000
So let's have a look about what are applications of environmental sustainability in open source

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
and one very important aspect there is the environmental intelligence. So you get satellite

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
data all around the world from multiple satellites, from NASA satellites, from ESA satellites

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
and most of this especially satellite data that deals with the environment that is really

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
looking at the environment is actually open to the public and you can process it. There

06:21.000 --> 06:31.000
is a lot of open source tools and with this multi-spectra and also with images and with

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
today also spatial resolution and temporal resolution of those satellites you can derive

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
multiple aspects of our environment like the air quality but also how our forest changed

06:41.000 --> 06:50.000
and also how noise actually is changing with our cities. You can measure but also and it's

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
very important point source emissions that means who is actually creating emissions and

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
you can directly point at this is the company who creates this amount of emissions and this

07:00.000 --> 07:09.000
is getting more and more an important topic because we have now multiple aspects that

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
are coming like CO2, Texas and carbon trading where we actually need traceable data about

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
what is the amount of emissions somebody created but on the other side there's also things

07:22.000 --> 07:29.000
like biodiversity that you can measure like satellites create images with not just RGB

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
but they have a huge amount of different colors that they measure and if you combine those

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
colors you can actually derive the change of biodiversity of forest or any living being

07:42.000 --> 07:50.000
on the planet. Another important topic is also the urban vegetation so how do we lose our

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
urban vegetation and in combination with the heat islands because where we lose our urban

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
vegetation you have at the same time for the heat islands it means with climate change

08:01.000 --> 08:14.000
it will get very hot in this areas. So but there's also the application directly in our

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
real world technology that we're seeing and we found very amazing projects like a complete

08:22.000 --> 08:30.000
50 megawatt wind turbine that was being released open source so that means there's the blueprints

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
how to build this wind turbine there's the simulation so all the software that actually is

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
needed to design this wind turbines has been open sourced and in combination with multiple

08:43.000 --> 08:53.000
American and European organizations but you will also find interesting software libraries

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
that help you to predict where do you place your photovoltaic and what is the perfect orientation

08:59.000 --> 09:09.000
of your photovoltaic in relation to the sun so that you have the most efficient of those solar

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
panels but and there was also a talk about pipes yesterday we have now with open source

09:17.000 --> 09:26.000
it was we have now a complete simulation of the world energy grid and all those energy systems

09:26.000 --> 09:35.000
that are within this huge network of different power plants but also of the renewables and

09:35.000 --> 09:45.000
you see here for example the power grid of India how it was simulated with pipes so

09:45.000 --> 09:54.000
so what we actually did is a methodology that I from my analysis nobody did before an open

09:54.000 --> 10:02.000
source in general so the first thing we did is we compiled this list and it took me two years

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
and I think more than 500 hours to investigate all those projects worldwide and we used multiple

10:09.000 --> 10:16.000
ways how to do it and you find it in the study in the report that we released some weeks ago

10:16.000 --> 10:29.000
it was a combination of researching on GitHub, GitLab, searching on different papers doing

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
data mining but we also just looked on the stars of different people on GitHub so what are

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
the people starring actually that are working in environmental sustainability so this was a

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
huge effort but also the community helped us a lot so we had about more than 30 volunteers

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
that contributed to the list and helped us to curate this list but and we really were focusing

10:54.000 --> 11:03.000
on projects that were aiming on environmental sustainability at their core. The core idea

11:03.000 --> 11:10.000
was to keep the list in a way that it is possible so we really try to list GitHub projects

11:10.000 --> 11:19.000
because GitLab and also GitLab projects are every kind of repository where people can

11:19.000 --> 11:31.000
participate into and so first step was creating the list and after that we created some scripts

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
to automatically gather the metadata of all those projects and we created some targeted

11:38.000 --> 11:46.000
interviews with all those domains we investigated and the domains actually were derived within

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
the study so this is not, this is our let's say perspective on this ecosystem and the

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
namings that we use there and you see here in the middle that's actually the core project

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
open sustainable technology and around us are the fields and within the fields are different

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
topics that we put the projects into and after that we did the cooperative report and

12:11.000 --> 12:18.000
cross-validated actually the qualitative and quantitative insights that we derived from

12:18.000 --> 12:32.000
this investigation. So here's the overview of the data set and you can see we have

12:32.000 --> 12:42.000
in total 1,339 projects, this was quite some work and most of them were actually GitHub

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
projects, some were GitLab projects and I must say actually the numbers here are all

12:50.000 --> 12:58.000
dealing with the GitHub projects. We could not integrate so far the GitLab API into the

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
study, I hope to do this in further studies and also to integrate other platforms but

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
to keep it simple the first study was really focusing on GitHub and actually on GitHub

13:11.000 --> 13:20.000
we also found most projects. You see here also that we listed the active project so

13:20.000 --> 13:28.000
within the study we tried only to list projects that had one closed issue in the last year

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
that or one commit and that are documented and have a certain kind of quality so we did

13:36.000 --> 13:43.000
a small quality analysis of the project is there some documentation can people actually

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
build the software by their own and use this in their own projects this was very important

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
in the investigation and you can see here we derived a total number of stars and a total

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
number of contributors but also other quantities to just show, give you an impression about

14:00.000 --> 14:12.000
how is the ecosystem in itself, how in this direction does it go. What you can also see

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
is that we listed some inactive projects so actually this was the hard part of the study

14:18.000 --> 14:26.000
as you maybe know most open source projects die very soon so within the project actually

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
192 projects actually got inactive and this was also my impression when we do this analysis

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
most projects were really inactive. I have no clear numbers but I think it's more than

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
90% of the projects we investigated were inactive they were just academia projects where somebody

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
released a paper and then it's just over that's it it's like throwing a open source project

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
to the wall and hope somebody maybe can use it but this is not where we want to focus on

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
we really wanted to focus on a project that you can use and that you can reintegrate into

14:59.000 --> 15:09.000
newer projects. So the first thing that I realized when doing this investigation is

15:09.000 --> 15:18.000
there's quite a low popularity in environmental sustainability so even if it is a hot topic

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
and you see it multiple times in the media and everybody is talking about it and yeah

15:23.000 --> 15:36.000
it sounds very trendy we could just find three projects that have more than 1,000 stars and

15:36.000 --> 15:49.000
in total on GitHub you find 38,000 projects that have more than 1,000 stars so it's just

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
not and that's also what's my impression so most people are really not appreciating those

15:54.000 --> 16:01.000
climate models or for example those biodiversity models that have been created and that are

16:01.000 --> 16:10.000
actually being maintained by different organizations both white. So on the left hand side you see

16:10.000 --> 16:19.000
actually the color bar that is a community health index that we created it's called the

16:19.000 --> 16:26.000
development distribution score and we realized that actually the most important aspect of an

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
open source project is how much is the knowledge and the development distributed within the

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
project itself so we created just a very small number by the comment that is just we you take

16:38.000 --> 16:45.000
the number the comments of the strongest contributor and divide it by the total comments and you

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
get an impression how much does this project actually depend on one developer or is there

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
actually really community behind it and you see the AB Street that is the most popular

16:59.000 --> 17:08.000
project is really one-man show that's actually a project where somebody is trying to do a

17:08.000 --> 17:19.000
gamification of cities to improve our transport system to do it more sustainable. After that

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
it's a very famous project and also it is a for-profit open source project that is called

17:24.000 --> 17:34.000
electricity map and after that we still see project like open farm or that or the scarf

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
under that is actually a green software project so they are all dealing with different kinds

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
of aspects how do we investigate and create knowledge about our environment and how can

17:46.000 --> 17:54.000
we improve our society so that we create less impact on our ecosystem let's say negative

17:54.000 --> 18:02.000
impact but you see also there some in popularity some climate models like or let's say earth

18:02.000 --> 18:11.000
science models and frameworks like Pangeo and it's or various models that are actually

18:11.000 --> 18:20.000
also very important like the WRF so on the right hand side you see the contributors so

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
the total numbers of contributors that we could find within a project and electricity map

18:25.000 --> 18:33.000
there is again the let's say dominating project and electricity map is actually they combine

18:33.000 --> 18:44.000
the so-called carbon intensity of all different electric grids worldwide to give you an impression

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
or give you a number about when I am consuming this amount of electricity at this point on

18:50.000 --> 19:00.000
the earth how much carbon do I actually release to the atmosphere by this power consumption

19:00.000 --> 19:08.000
and this was really let's say one of the very few larger communities that we could find

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
where a lot of academic and for-profits and different organizations were coming together

19:14.000 --> 19:22.000
to create this the another project is actually the open food network where people try to create

19:22.000 --> 19:33.000
trustable knowledge and information about how what what is the information of food itself

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
so that you can have trustworthy information and this is also a huge community project

19:38.000 --> 19:45.000
quite old and you can also see here just green project and very larger atmospheric project

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
but in general you see the total numbers of contributors if you compare it with our open

19:50.000 --> 20:03.000
food projects are quite low it's not that big and for me personally actually the so this

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
project itself has one thousand three hundred star so we are actually one of the most popular

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
open source projects in the environmental sustainability and this is not a good sign

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
but because I'm just we are just some random dudes it's we are we are actually we have

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
a foundation we are just a community and people were coming together you know and that's what

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
I wanted to show with this slide so within the open source community there's a lack for

20:29.000 --> 20:41.000
of popularity in environmental sustainability so if you look at the license and language

20:41.000 --> 20:49.000
of projects we see there's a lot of MIT license actually so it's actually easy to integrate

20:49.000 --> 20:56.000
those projects into for profit not that hard but there's also let's say a good portion

20:56.000 --> 21:07.000
of a free open source license like gpl 3.0 but what do we also could find is that with

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
their data analysis we could not always really invest automatically investigate what is actually

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
the license of the project so that's the custom license and this is always problematic so if

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
you release open source code use a standard license that people know about they don't need a

21:26.000 --> 21:33.000
lawyer to actually see if they can actually reintegrate the software into maybe a commercial

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
project because we want to when we need to go with such approaches into commercial projects

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
if we don't commercialize environmental sustainability we will never achieve environmental

21:45.000 --> 21:54.000
sustainability on the right hand side you see the portion the proportions of the programming

21:54.000 --> 22:01.000
languages and here we can see that actually data analysis and data driven languages are

22:01.000 --> 22:13.000
really on the top I can imagine that you expect Python here but also R is here very prominent

22:13.000 --> 22:21.000
because in environmental sustainability it's a lot of statistics and processing a lot of data

22:21.000 --> 22:30.000
but we can also find here Fortron and C++ and those languages are used in the large scale

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
simulation of our earth so if you want to really be efficient in your calculations that's the

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
programming languages that you use and the high portion actually of Fortron shows us that many

22:44.000 --> 22:52.000
of those software projects are quite old this is really sometimes code that is 20 30 years old

22:52.000 --> 22:59.000
where our earth and our atmosphere biosphere hydrosphere has been simulated and this code has

22:59.000 --> 23:09.000
been reintegrated into new software projects yeah another JavaScript is here not that important

23:09.000 --> 23:22.000
so but that's what we also did is from the we actually derived from the projects all the

23:22.000 --> 23:29.000
organizations behind it so what is actually the namespaces of the projects and from the namespaces

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
of the projects we had a little bit smaller list and this was actually hand labeled so we went

23:35.000 --> 23:44.000
through all those organizations and created actually the location but also the continent of

23:44.000 --> 23:53.000
those organizations and we see there's let's say Europe has quite a good standing here and also

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
North America we found a lot of project that consider themselves organizations that consider

23:58.000 --> 24:06.000
themselves as global so but unfortunately I have to say actually from Asia and I did a lot of

24:06.000 --> 24:14.000
investigations I could not find a lot of open source projects that actually originate from the

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
Asian continent whereas really an organization behind it it doesn't mean that there are not

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
people involved into this just wanted to say that we could not find it and I did there a lot of

24:23.000 --> 24:35.000
research on this yes what we also did is we labeled the forms of organizations behind it so

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
and it was surprising for me that actually the community based projects like we are the strongest

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
so community we labeled when there was no legal structure behind it just some people coming

24:49.000 --> 24:58.000
together doing stuff this was considered community and after that academia has a very important

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
role there because they did a lot of this research investigations in our environmental

25:03.000 --> 25:10.000
sustainability but also government agency are very important in this domain unfortunately

25:10.000 --> 25:20.000
I have to also to say for profits and that's a general trend are not that prominent we did

25:20.000 --> 25:31.000
I did a lot of investigations into the kind of do we find actually commercialized or for profit

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
applications of this kind of software and I told you about electricity map that's maybe let's say

25:36.000 --> 25:43.000
the most one really successful project that we can find but besides that there is Microsoft is

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
actually doing some good open source project in environmental sustainability like the planetary

25:48.000 --> 25:56.000
compute framework and so there's some other good developments but compared to the problem that

25:56.000 --> 26:03.000
we are dealing with this is a little bit disappointing so it cannot be that this is just

26:03.000 --> 26:09.000
been an academia community thing with some maybe some government agencies so there needs to be

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
more for profit organizations and I think we see this also now with commercial open source

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
software is becoming more and more important and there's really no billions of dollars going

26:19.000 --> 26:26.000
in this kind of development but we're missing there totally in this domain

26:30.000 --> 26:41.000
so you can see here this is all project that we mapped scattered over the project age you see

26:41.000 --> 26:49.000
here the topics and they are actually ordered we also created a size score so that we can order them

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
you see the strongest was actually biosphere but this was also because we not separated

26:54.000 --> 27:01.000
actually biosphere so strongly if you would combine climate data processing and the climate models

27:01.000 --> 27:10.000
actually climate science I would say in general would be the most strongest area but also what

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
was quite interesting is that actually hypersphere so the people dealing with our water resources

27:16.000 --> 27:23.000
they were also very strong we could find a lot of strong projects there it's all the same for soil

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
it's all about air quality it's about agriculture and nutrition so really that what is really

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
describing the state of our environment there we know a lot there's a lot of information about

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
what is actually the state where we are going but if you go more into let's say the technology area

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
if it's if you're talking about batteries if you're talking about hydrogen, bioenergy, carbon capture

27:46.000 --> 27:56.000
and removal there it was super hard to find good projects that we could list and also more

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
surprisingly for me in the area of sustainable investment because sustainable investment is

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
really something that a starter driven there's a lot of huge companies behind it that gather

28:07.000 --> 28:14.000
information that a lot of they have a lot of models and ways how to consider what is actually

28:14.000 --> 28:22.000
sustainable in our investment and there was actually two or three really strong projects

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
but they were also at the beginning and compared to the problem we are facing this was also a little

28:27.000 --> 28:38.000
bit disappointing other areas like also carbon capture and carbon offsets were also not that prominent

28:38.000 --> 28:46.000
and I would say if you're more interested in the quantities that we created we created much more

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
about the growth about the different kinds of communities and we created a lot of quantities

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
and plots for you you will find us in the report so I would stop here to talk actually about

28:57.000 --> 29:05.000
let's say the quantitative analysis and go more into the into the suggestions into the recommendations

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
that we derived from our analysis and from the interviews and from the people that we talked to

29:10.000 --> 29:20.000
and also I must say the discussions we had within the group lead to a lot of interesting aspects

29:20.000 --> 29:31.000
and recommendations so sustainable rating and investment is really getting a huge and important

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
topic and it influence all of you because this is where actually your future is going into

29:38.000 --> 29:47.000
that means there's actually the United Nations principles for responsible investment this was

29:47.000 --> 29:57.000
created you see here 2006 and they created some really baseline for what and how do we actually do

29:57.000 --> 30:05.000
sustainable investment and you see here that actually in 2021 we are not talking about 100

30:05.000 --> 30:14.000
around 140 trillions of dollars that are invest invested based on those principles so there's

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
a huge amount of money going in this direction that needs to be because we actually want to

30:19.000 --> 30:33.000
transform our economy to a let's say sustainable system so the problem is that how I was very

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
interested in this domain and I did a lot of investigations I talked to people about this

30:38.000 --> 30:45.000
and we analyzed how this is done so how is actually sustainable rating and assessment

30:45.000 --> 30:52.000
being done and actually it is a big black box to summarize it you have some sustainability

30:52.000 --> 30:59.000
reports that are actually self reported by the companies and then are there's a lot of news

30:59.000 --> 31:05.000
about sustainability of companies and a lot of marketing that you know and this is actually

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
being combined in so-called sustainability assessment and there are multiple companies

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
that are doing this and there's really not so much known about really how this goes and you see

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
here also how actually greenwashing works it's very easy you create very beautiful reports that

31:21.000 --> 31:29.000
really look very good nobody is really trace is really assessing if they are really based on

31:29.000 --> 31:35.000
science it's really that you do self reporting about your environmental sustainability and then

31:35.000 --> 31:42.000
this sustainability assessments also take into account news about those companies actually so how

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
is there good news about the environmental impact of those companies or bad news and they also take

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
financial news about those companies and this is all is being combined in sustainable sustainability

31:55.000 --> 32:01.000
assessment and then there comes a magic number and based on those numbers 140 trillion of

32:01.000 --> 32:10.000
dollars are invested somewhere okay that's crazy from my perspective and I dig a little bit into

32:10.000 --> 32:19.000
this and I realized oh there's a lot of scientists that realize that actually this is like throwing

32:19.000 --> 32:26.000
the dice what this rating companies are actually doing you see here on the bottom that's actually

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
the value of the benchmark rating from one company called system analytics and then you see here the

32:32.000 --> 32:40.000
divergence of this ratings and if there would be an ideal word this would be one line okay they

32:40.000 --> 32:48.000
would all agree on environmental sustainability but and actually they do not agree so you just

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
have to go to the right rating agency and you can make every company actually sustainable today

32:53.000 --> 33:02.000
very easily been done and you also have to see that actually the rating itself has some so you

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
don't get normally the very bad rating or the very good rating right so in general it is you just

33:09.000 --> 33:15.000
have to throw the dice and also the offer saying addressing ESG rating that means environmental

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
governments because this is actually a little bit a combination of different kinds of ratings they do

33:19.000 --> 33:28.000
environmental but also a social sustainability rating and governments rating at diverges requires

33:28.000 --> 33:34.000
addressing ESG rating divergence requires one to understand how the data that underpins ESG

33:34.000 --> 33:43.000
ratings are generated so nobody knows how this data is generated and I think you know already the

33:43.000 --> 33:52.000
solution so when nobody knows our data is generated and we have a big black box yeah then

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
you normally take open source but this is not happening because people are also doing the same

33:58.000 --> 34:04.000
thing in the so-called carbon offset so if your company is actually creating a lot of emissions

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
and you want to be carbon neutral and you see this labeled all over the place now everybody's

34:09.000 --> 34:17.000
carbon neutral and it's great that they all actually want to be carbon neutral but there's

34:17.000 --> 34:24.000
actually a study being done by the Guardian and they investigated how much of those carbon that is

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
actually released in the atmosphere is actually being stored back into our soil and into our

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
ground and you see this on the right hand side there's actually the carbon cycle that is driving

34:35.000 --> 34:42.000
the CO2 into the atmosphere is actually a natural let's say there's a natural cycle that actually

34:42.000 --> 34:54.000
is going on and this cycle was created by actually it took millions of years to stabilize our

34:54.000 --> 34:59.000
atmosphere by this carbon cycle so that we have a low portion of carbon within our atmosphere

34:59.000 --> 35:05.000
and this way a stable weather and stable climate and the predictable earth systems that we all

35:05.000 --> 35:13.000
can depend on but yeah the Guardian found out that the real emissions that are actually stored

35:13.000 --> 35:22.000
in the ground are much lower than actually what they are claiming for so actually they say that

35:22.000 --> 35:33.000
over 90% of those carbon offsets people are claiming for actually claims that's what the

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
Guardian is saying here but you see another problem Guardian is the Guardian is just showing

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
your plot and that's actually the core problem of all of this they just at the end show your

35:43.000 --> 35:50.000
plot and then you believe my plot I did great science behind it just trust my science and

35:50.000 --> 35:57.000
that's let's say the core problem I want to investigate with you a little bit more so

35:57.000 --> 36:05.000
because we're talking about here about safety critical decision making the we know exactly

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
and I showed you this also with the topics and with the numbers of people that are investigating

36:10.000 --> 36:16.000
we know very good with open science that is traceable for all of you you can go into this

36:16.000 --> 36:23.000
climate models and they're very good examples for in in in simple Python you can but you

36:23.000 --> 36:33.000
will also find larger open climate science projects that you can just run on your machine

36:33.000 --> 36:40.000
and they all come to the same result that we are actually on a very bad path on with

36:40.000 --> 36:47.000
colliding with the earth actually and this is very clear to us so there's no doubt so

36:47.000 --> 36:54.000
if you if you don't trust into climate science just go into repositories create an issue or

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
deal with the software that you find there so opens the problem that we are facing now

37:01.000 --> 37:08.000
is that the decision making the assessment of sustainable and sustainable investment there

37:08.000 --> 37:14.000
we have no clue what we actually do and there's no open source software and not much open

37:14.000 --> 37:25.000
source software that we could really find so but there's help and especially in the energy

37:25.000 --> 37:32.000
sector we found a lot of good projects that that that really understand how to get rid

37:32.000 --> 37:39.000
of those problem of traceability because when somebody just is showing you a plot I think

37:39.000 --> 37:46.000
hydrogen will be the future of energy of the energy sector and there comes somebody else

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
and shows you another plot this cannot really come you cannot really create a discussion

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
about this and this is really everybody needs to be at least able to discuss about this right

37:57.000 --> 38:05.000
now and what they did in in actually in the energy modeling so the this pipes up project

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
actually I showed you at the beginning they release those models and in this way you can

38:10.000 --> 38:19.000
create proof and show hey I calculated this if you don't agree with me show me your model

38:19.000 --> 38:27.000
and if you don't show me your model I don't trust you that's that's how it goes and this

38:27.000 --> 38:38.000
is really let's say a very important idea that I found here it's that you you need to

38:38.000 --> 38:46.000
understand that you can actually prove how much conclusion is actually being open and

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
traceable you just have to see how much open data is there and is there uncertainties

38:51.000 --> 38:57.000
actually also in the data that is comes with the data is there open source models are there

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
is there actually an open execution possible of those models do you find open results of

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
those execution so is the artifacts actually create by its simulation is this actually

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
also open source is there a way to participate can you go into the GitHub repository can you

39:13.000 --> 39:19.000
go into a conference and ask the question how you had has he done this and is this conclusion

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
with uncertainties at the end so is there a plot that shows what is actually my unknown

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
my uncertainty what or is it just a single number and if it's just a single number it's

39:31.000 --> 39:39.000
a problem and we can propagate the uncertainty through such a thing and that's very important

39:39.000 --> 39:49.000
for traceability then what we found out that actually openness itself and that's let's say

39:49.000 --> 39:56.000
one of the core findings of the whole study is the is the indicator for sustainability

39:56.000 --> 40:02.000
itself so if you want to know and it's very important to understand we sometimes don't

40:02.000 --> 40:10.000
know today what is actually sustainable but if there comes somebody and says I personally

40:10.000 --> 40:15.000
don't know if I'm really sustainable but I show you how I calculated why I think I am

40:15.000 --> 40:21.000
sustainable this show sustainable intention and this is what we need today because then

40:21.000 --> 40:31.000
you can go into and discussion you can go with people into some maintenance of code

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
you can improve your own code and that's why actually openness itself is the core is

40:36.000 --> 40:43.000
really the key indicator for sustainability itself you see also despite a picture this

40:43.000 --> 40:50.000
was shows the standing on the shores of giants but from my perspective really describes very

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
good open source open source or let's say the technology that we built that is this

40:55.000 --> 41:02.000
blind giant and we are standing on the shoulder but we can see farther by the giant but you

41:02.000 --> 41:08.000
cannot but the giant itself is blind but we can see much much farther and we can and

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
the giants get bigger and bigger and we can see and predict the future in a much better

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
way and that's why open source and actually the math and the models that we create there

41:17.000 --> 41:24.000
are so important to predict the future so one interesting aspect that I found to get

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
rid of this problem is actually spatial finance it's the idea that we can use those

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
whole earth observation data that we have to track down companies about environmental

41:35.000 --> 41:44.000
sustainability so all those software in earth observation all those open source software

41:44.000 --> 41:51.000
there is a huge amount of open source software and earth observation can be used by rating

41:51.000 --> 41:57.000
agencies and all of us to actually track down companies on the environmental impact that's

41:57.000 --> 42:04.000
not that hard and there's actually an Oxford group that started the spatial finance and

42:04.000 --> 42:11.000
what they started with is they created a map of the whole fossil fuel industry where you

42:11.000 --> 42:17.000
know the whole supply chain so where are they located where is the fuel supply chain that

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
helps you to on the one side simulate it but also to check satellite data and track down

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
okay this company has a claim that they're actually sustainable let's have a look and

42:26.000 --> 42:35.000
you have suddenly a sensor that is measuring the sustainability and that is needed so here

42:35.000 --> 42:46.000
is my let's say that's how I would actually improve the rating of environmental sustainability

42:46.000 --> 42:53.000
and how we can actually get rid of those problem is to actually integrate earth observation

42:53.000 --> 43:00.000
into this processing chain and very importantly where the assessment happens we need open source

43:00.000 --> 43:07.000
code and that's actually just one from the Leung's Foundation one project that is starting

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
to do this but this is really everything very early stage and then suddenly we can maybe

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
in the future get sustainability ratings about companies that have some uncertainties but

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
it would be also very great if companies itself would use open source code to do environmental

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
sustainability rating within the company so for me personally I would like if ExoMobil

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
would say we would go open science now or every company that goes open science about their

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
own environmental sustainability would have such a massive impact on the industry because

43:39.000 --> 43:46.000
finally you have the information and data to really measure sustainability within the

43:46.000 --> 43:54.000
company because so far this is all the black box for us so yeah I would like to say that

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
open source is from my perspective the most underestimated climate strategy or climate action

44:00.000 --> 44:10.000
it is there's so much opportunity there that we created a whole list of recommendations

44:10.000 --> 44:17.000
how open source can have a significant impact so actually we were thinking about what could

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
be follow-up projects and we had so many ideas about follow-up projects that we just were

44:22.000 --> 44:29.000
starting to list them all down as recommendations I think there are more than 50 now and I just

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
thought you two of them in combination actually so and yeah my final words would actually

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
be and that's I think we need to understand we need to build an operating system for environmental

44:42.000 --> 44:51.000
sustainability it is for this for things like carbon offsets or the rating of the environmental

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
impact of companies you need to connect all the spheres all those open source projects

44:57.000 --> 45:05.000
together to get one to bet get a better conclusion about what is the state of our environment

45:05.000 --> 45:12.000
and that's why and that's I hope and that's what we hope to start and hope to build in the

45:12.000 --> 45:38.000
future is really such kind of an operating system yeah thank you so much

45:38.000 --> 45:48.000
well thank you Tobias for your brain exploding presentation we have you can type your questions

45:48.000 --> 45:56.000
in matrix or you can just raise your hand and I will bring you the microphone oh gosh okay

45:56.000 --> 46:16.000
I lost you in the crowd again again please Tobias thank you so much for very inspiring

46:16.000 --> 46:26.000
presentation can you hear me and I absolutely agree that open source is very much underestimated

46:26.000 --> 46:36.000
as source of sustainability and a question can you suggest any ways how can developers

46:36.000 --> 46:45.000
collaborate better so for example I know that there are some gaps in climate modeling in

46:45.000 --> 46:51.000
bridging between climate modeling and energy modeling and it would be very helpful if energy

46:51.000 --> 46:58.000
modelers would know better about climate modelers and vice versa do you have any ideas can you

46:58.000 --> 47:07.000
suggest something to improve this situation can you hear me yeah I think what is really

47:07.000 --> 47:13.000
missing is the community behind it that is cross over the topics actually conference you

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
meet somewhere where these people meet and talk to each other that's what is missing and

47:18.000 --> 47:24.000
we realized and that's why we actually would and also the topic of environmental sustainability

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
is always a side topic in open source conferences somewhere but we really need a conference

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
actually there that's the point where this this connection between the software projects is

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
starting at the beer in the evening maybe where these people are connecting they are not really

47:42.000 --> 47:52.000
connected with each other that's why this list is so successful they could not find each other

47:52.000 --> 48:01.000
Tobias you mentioned that's a very low for profit organizations currently yes but this if they

48:01.000 --> 48:09.000
increase we have also the lobbyism problem again because they are much more trained to get

48:09.000 --> 48:17.000
money for their already existing projects do you see some chance that new open source projects

48:17.000 --> 48:29.000
in this group will also get paid contributors this is also an opportunity yes it's not I'm not

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
the biggest fan of commercial open source software I see there's some opportunities there are

48:33.000 --> 48:40.000
good ways bad ways it depends on topic and the climate model should maybe not be in for profit

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
but if it is maybe about the rating yeah there should be a company behind so something it really

48:46.000 --> 48:53.000
depends on the kind of project we are talking about so for example if you if you want to create

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
a wind turbine right a wind turbine that is open source completely you need a company that

48:59.000 --> 49:06.000
maybe gives you 40 years of maintenance and it needs to be sure that this is maintenance and

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
miss maybe this is better with a for profit but depending on the project maybe on with a

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
non-profit it's not an easy question what is the right organization for an open source project

49:16.000 --> 49:30.000
it's very complicated
