[00:00.000 --> 00:12.300]  Hello, my name is David, also known as Jorik, and I'll be your host for this session on
[00:12.300 --> 00:15.540]  decentralizing moderation.
[00:15.540 --> 00:20.340]  Most of this work was actually done by Knuxy and DeSopo.
[00:20.340 --> 00:26.620]  And it's a work that we have been doing for the past few years, and it started at Element.
[00:26.620 --> 00:29.900]  And of course, it's about the matrix network.
[00:29.900 --> 00:37.380]  What we want to do, we want to make moderation something that actually, and not just theoretically,
[00:37.380 --> 00:42.300]  works in a decentralized federated network.
[00:42.300 --> 00:46.140]  So what is moderation?
[00:46.140 --> 00:52.100]  Moderation is something that's defined by the fact that we are communicating, that there
[00:52.100 --> 00:59.820]  may be rules on this communication, and that we have people who enforce those rules.
[00:59.820 --> 01:04.220]  The moderation part is the enforcing of those rules.
[01:04.220 --> 01:08.620]  Again, we are talking about the matrix network.
[01:08.620 --> 01:12.860]  Network, the network itself, has no clue about rules.
[01:12.860 --> 01:16.100]  You can have many different kinds of communities.
[01:16.100 --> 01:18.660]  Some of them are going to be family friendly.
[01:18.660 --> 01:21.580]  Some of them are going to be much more adult.
[01:21.580 --> 01:29.400]  Some might be work specific, or sport specific, or politics specific, anything else.
[01:29.400 --> 01:36.120]  And each one of them can have a different set of rules.
[01:36.120 --> 01:39.320]  If you do not have moderation, what's going to happen?
[01:39.320 --> 01:42.120]  Well, this is what's going to happen.
[01:42.120 --> 01:50.080]  You are happily chatting with your best friends in a room, and suddenly, Marvin decides that
[01:50.080 --> 01:56.160]  this room must be spammed with stinky French garlic spam.
[01:56.160 --> 01:59.720]  Who wants stinky French garlic spam in their room?
[01:59.720 --> 02:02.560]  I don't.
[02:02.560 --> 02:09.280]  This is where the moderator needs to step in, most likely kick Marvin away, or at least
[02:09.280 --> 02:14.680]  have a stern talking to Marvin, and get rid of the spam content.
[02:14.680 --> 02:19.400]  Of course, I'm talking about spam, but in the real world, it can be much, much worse
[02:19.400 --> 02:20.400]  than spam.
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.080]  I leave this open to your imagination.
[02:26.080 --> 02:30.200]  As mentioned, we're talking about federation.
[02:30.200 --> 02:39.600]  In this case, it means that we have users who connect to one communication room from
[02:39.600 --> 02:41.880]  a number of servers.
[02:41.880 --> 02:47.640]  For instance, today, listening to this presentation, I'm going to assume that some users are connecting
[02:47.640 --> 02:57.560]  from foestem.org, some from matrix.org, and presumably from a number of other servers.
[02:57.560 --> 03:03.520]  It means that the servers need to agree upon who is a moderator with the authorization
[03:03.520 --> 03:10.040]  to kick bad users and to get rid of bad content.
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.040]  That is something that the matrix network already handles.
[03:14.040 --> 03:16.200]  That's part of the specification.
[03:16.960 --> 03:21.960]  However, things can quickly become complicated.
[03:21.960 --> 03:25.360]  You don't have a single room on a server.
[03:25.360 --> 03:30.800]  You can have users who participate in multiple rooms, can be moderators in some of them,
[03:30.800 --> 03:33.600]  and not moderators in others.
[03:33.600 --> 03:41.520]  You can also have moderators who come from different home servers and who share the moderation
[03:41.520 --> 03:48.560]  burden and the moderation privilege in a number of rooms.
[03:48.560 --> 03:49.560]  That's possible.
[03:49.560 --> 03:55.760]  Typically, in the matrix network, you go one step further by introducing moderation
[03:55.760 --> 03:57.680]  rooms.
[03:57.680 --> 04:04.800]  Rather than having the moderators operate directly in the room they're moderating, they
[04:04.800 --> 04:08.960]  are members of a moderation room.
[04:08.960 --> 04:15.680]  In this moderation room, they use a bot to whom they have delegated the moderation abilities
[04:15.680 --> 04:19.000]  to perform the day-to-day actions.
[04:19.000 --> 04:27.880]  When Alice or Fred wish to kick Marvin, they ask Mjolnir, the name of the bot, to do this
[04:27.880 --> 04:30.040]  on their behalf.
[04:30.040 --> 04:32.000]  This has a number of advantages.
[04:32.000 --> 04:40.080]  One of them is that if Alice and Fred are moderators for many rooms, they only need
[04:40.080 --> 04:45.240]  to kick Marvin once if they need to kick him from all the rooms.
[04:45.240 --> 04:49.640]  They can also publish and share policy rooms.
[04:49.640 --> 04:54.840]  This is how we get into the even more federated part.
[04:54.840 --> 05:05.080]  Those policy rooms are what let rooms and communities work together to define rules,
[05:05.080 --> 05:14.040]  to define users who have been banned for being toxic and abusive or spammy and who should
[05:14.040 --> 05:18.440]  not put their foot anymore into any of those rooms.
[05:18.440 --> 05:31.000]  Generally, that is one step further in the federation of moderation itself.
[05:31.000 --> 05:38.200]  What you already have with Mjolnir, you have those moderation rooms which can again moderate
[05:38.200 --> 05:42.840]  a number of individual rooms, so entire communities.
[05:42.840 --> 05:47.240]  You have those moderation policies that you can publish, you don't have to, and you can
[05:47.240 --> 05:52.640]  share again federation between those communities.
[05:52.640 --> 06:02.320]  You also have the side benefit that moderators can operate with some degree of anonymity,
[06:02.320 --> 06:08.320]  which is good because we have seen a number of cases in which there are reprisals against
[06:08.320 --> 06:13.440]  moderators when they try to apply the rules.
[06:13.440 --> 06:18.640]  So at this stage, hey, we have decentralized moderation.
[06:18.640 --> 06:20.760]  Well thank you for coming and listening to this presentation.
[06:20.760 --> 06:26.880]  It was a very brief presentation, but it was a very intense one, so thank you.
[06:26.880 --> 06:34.360]  If you have any questions, oh, before I forget, yeah, if you want to use Mjolnir, you need
[06:34.360 --> 06:35.360]  to install it.
[06:35.360 --> 06:40.160]  It's not very hard, there are just six easy steps, I'm not going to read them out loud,
[06:40.160 --> 06:46.000]  and then you can use Mjolnir, sorry, I meant 10 steps, 10 easy steps, and then you can
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.320]  use Mjolnir, 16 easy steps.
[06:50.320 --> 06:55.320]  I mean, who doesn't know how to configure engines or pantalymons, right?
[06:55.320 --> 07:06.720]  But after these 21 easy steps involving Docker compose, these 23 steps, are we done yet?
[07:07.400 --> 07:10.440]  Yes, we're done.
[07:10.440 --> 07:18.960]  So after these 23 steps, the 24th step says that you can now start becoming a moderator
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.520]  for those rooms.
[07:20.520 --> 07:27.040]  It's great until you read step 25, which says that if you want to do this with another set
[07:27.040 --> 07:32.480]  of rooms, you have to repeat everything.
[07:32.800 --> 07:40.520]  That is a bit complicated, especially since moderators are typically, I mean, yes, some
[07:40.520 --> 07:47.080]  moderators are highly technologically literate, but some aren't, and they don't need to, or
[07:47.080 --> 07:50.440]  at least they shouldn't need to.
[07:50.440 --> 07:59.280]  So the main issue at this stage when we talk of decentralizing moderation is about democratizing
[07:59.280 --> 08:01.560]  moderation.
[08:01.560 --> 08:03.200]  How do we do that?
[08:03.200 --> 08:11.280]  Well that's the entire point of project Mjolnir for all, which has been developed by Knuxy
[08:11.280 --> 08:12.800]  and Jezopo.
[08:12.800 --> 08:19.880]  And before I proceed, I would like to continue with a public service announcement.
[08:19.880 --> 08:29.760]  If you know employers or potential employers for two highly passionate and high level developers,
[08:29.760 --> 08:35.160]  please get in touch with them, or with me.
[08:35.160 --> 08:39.320]  So what would we like at this stage?
[08:39.320 --> 08:44.440]  We would like something simple, something that does not involve the 25 steps mentioned
[08:44.440 --> 08:45.440]  earlier.
[08:45.440 --> 08:50.560]  We would like to simply be able to invite Mjolnir, confirm that it's the moderator,
[08:50.560 --> 08:53.840]  and be done with it.
[08:53.840 --> 08:56.440]  So can we do that?
[08:56.440 --> 08:58.880]  Let's see how this works.
[08:58.880 --> 09:08.560]  Here we are, me and my best pal having a chat in our very own very interesting room.
[09:08.560 --> 09:15.160]  And just in case, I'm going to set up decentralized moderation for this room.
[09:15.160 --> 09:20.920]  So let's invite the Mjolnir bot.
[09:20.920 --> 09:29.800]  This creates two rooms, one of them that is going to be useful for sharing policies.
[09:29.800 --> 09:35.200]  In case I want to cooperate with other moderators, for instance, and we have a common base of
[09:35.200 --> 09:47.200]  people who wish to kick, and a moderation room in which we can actually use Mjolnir.
[09:47.200 --> 09:49.440]  Let's not forget one thing.
[09:49.440 --> 10:02.920]  We need to make sure that our moderator can moderate.
[10:02.920 --> 10:09.520]  With this, the moderator is no in position of moderating.
[10:09.520 --> 10:20.440]  And if someone were to, say, send some spam, oh no, spam has arrived.
[10:20.440 --> 10:21.440]  Well we should do something.
[10:21.440 --> 10:25.440]  Okay, I'm not going to do something right now because I'm not planning to demonstrate
[10:25.440 --> 10:29.600]  all the features of Mjolnir, or of Mjolnir for all.
[10:29.600 --> 10:36.400]  But we are no in a position where we can do something about it.
[10:36.400 --> 10:44.400]  So we can kick, we can ban, etc.
[10:44.400 --> 10:53.880]  The objective here is to ship Mjolnir for all with home servers.
[10:53.880 --> 10:59.760]  Let's face it, there is still a difficulty involved in setting up Mjolnir for all as
[10:59.760 --> 11:03.920]  the administrator.
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.920]  And this difficulty, I would like to consider, is part of the difficulty of setting up the
[11:08.920 --> 11:11.440]  home server.
[11:11.440 --> 11:15.240]  Of course, it can also be shipped as standalone.
[11:15.240 --> 11:21.240]  But as you have seen, if the administrator of the home server or the administrator of
[11:21.240 --> 11:28.760]  the Mjolnir for all does the necessary steps to set this up, moderators can do something
[11:29.760 --> 11:32.440]  well, they don't need to set up anything.
[11:32.440 --> 11:36.440]  It's just two clicks version.
[11:36.440 --> 11:44.880]  They just need to invite Mjolnir and confirm that Mjolnir is entitled to moderation rights.
[11:44.880 --> 11:51.160]  We even have a prototype of a user interface that does this with a button in element.
[11:51.160 --> 11:55.920]  I'm not going to demonstrate it here because I'm going to run out of time.
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.320]  But that works too.
[12:00.320 --> 12:05.440]  At this stage, Mjolnir for all doesn't implement the entirety of features of Mjolnir.
[12:05.440 --> 12:08.800]  It's pretty close, but that would need to be finished.
[12:08.800 --> 12:17.000]  And once we have all of that, well, this can entirely transform the experience for communities.
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.560]  Because creating a community is just something that you can do by creating a new room, possibly
[12:24.560 --> 12:29.240]  creating a space and inviting Mjolnir for all.
[12:29.240 --> 12:30.240]  And you're done.
[12:30.240 --> 12:37.680]  None of these messy 25 steps of installation of Mjolnir.
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.360]  There is one more problem that I'd like to talk about.
[12:43.360 --> 12:50.320]  Whether it's in a federated world or in a non federated world, at some point you will
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.680]  need to call for help.
[12:54.680 --> 13:00.800]  Possibly because you have just witnessed Marvin publishing some French garlic stinky
[13:00.800 --> 13:09.720]  spam in the room, possibly because you are a victim of abuse, bullying, harassment or
[13:09.720 --> 13:11.640]  witness of some.
[13:11.640 --> 13:17.400]  And you wish to attract the attention of moderators on that so that they can do something
[13:17.400 --> 13:20.720]  about it.
[13:20.720 --> 13:27.960]  In the current flow, well in element, but it's basically the same thing with other
[13:27.960 --> 13:30.820]  metrics clients, what do you do?
[13:30.820 --> 13:36.360]  You click on report, you write a few words to explain that what's going on and you wait
[13:36.360 --> 13:39.000]  for something to happen.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.480]  As you'll see, in many cases, you can wait for a long, long time.
[13:44.480 --> 13:50.720]  Because on the other side, how do you get access to these goals for help, also known
[13:50.720 --> 13:52.760]  as moderation requests?
[13:52.760 --> 13:58.480]  Well, the official workflow in Synapse is the following.
[13:58.480 --> 14:00.800]  First you need to create an admin account.
[14:00.800 --> 14:03.680]  It's documented but not standard.
[14:03.680 --> 14:10.280]  Then you need to write your program to pull a REST API, which is also documented and
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.800]  also not standard.
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.400]  Then you're going to see the requests, assuming that your program works and you can do something
[14:17.400 --> 14:18.800]  about it.
[14:18.800 --> 14:22.320]  But that's not really ideal, right?
[14:22.320 --> 14:27.600]  Because first you need to be the admin to get the moderation requests.
[14:27.600 --> 14:36.480]  And then you need some custom program, surely that's not how it works.
[14:36.480 --> 14:43.520]  So for one year and something, we've had a new flow in Muernier to replace that.
[14:43.520 --> 14:48.320]  You need to install engines, you need to set it up, you need to set up Muernier for that.
[14:48.320 --> 14:54.200]  And instead of having to write a custom tool, you're going to see the requests in the room,
[14:54.200 --> 14:57.840]  in the moderation room, which is infinitely better.
[14:57.840 --> 15:03.160]  But it's still not good enough because you need to install the engines for one thing and
[15:03.160 --> 15:07.560]  because that's only for one home server.
[15:07.560 --> 15:13.400]  That's still in this paradigm in which you have only one community per home server.
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.120]  And as we have seen, that's not the case.
[15:17.120 --> 15:25.040]  It gets worse because to receive the call for help, you'd better hope that the user
[15:25.040 --> 15:30.320]  is connecting from the same home server as an administrator who can do something about
[15:30.320 --> 15:32.000]  it.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.440]  If, for instance, you are in this room, which I believe is a FOSDEM or .org room, I mean
[15:38.440 --> 15:44.720]  the room in which you may be listening to this presentation.
[15:44.720 --> 15:51.520]  I'm going to assume that all the moderators and all the people who can do something have
[15:51.520 --> 15:53.280]  accounts on FOSDEM.org.
[15:53.280 --> 15:57.560]  This might not be true, but for the example, let's say that it is.
[15:57.560 --> 16:06.920]  If you are sending a call for help from an account on matrix.org, then this call for
[16:06.920 --> 16:11.800]  help is going to be received by administrators for matrix.org.
[16:11.800 --> 16:17.680]  And if none of the administrators for matrix.org can do anything about FOSDEM.org, for instance,
[16:17.680 --> 16:23.160]  because they're not members of the room and they do not have moderation rights in this
[16:23.160 --> 16:30.360]  room, well, in that case, they can do nothing about it.
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.240]  So that is still broken.
[16:34.240 --> 16:39.920]  On the upside, that's why what we've been working on, let me tell you about Project
[16:39.920 --> 16:46.000]  Aristotle, which is one brick that interacts with Muir near for all to implement this call
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.800]  for help in a decentralized world.
[16:48.800 --> 16:51.680]  In this case, that is my work.
[16:51.680 --> 16:58.760]  And the public announcement made by my colleagues is true for me, too.
[16:58.760 --> 17:03.000]  So what do we want?
[17:03.000 --> 17:09.960]  We want to take advantage of Muir near for all so that whenever someone calls for help,
[17:09.960 --> 17:16.920]  the moderator in the room for which help has been requested gets the information.
[17:17.240 --> 17:19.840]  Moderators, of course.
[17:19.840 --> 17:27.800]  And these are the people who can actually act upon the situation.
[17:27.800 --> 17:32.800]  Let's see how that works out in the current state of things.
[17:32.800 --> 17:37.120]  I'd love to tell you that we have already reached the stage at which this feature is
[17:37.120 --> 17:40.360]  fully streamlined and integrated into everything.
[17:40.360 --> 17:43.120]  It's not quite the case yet.
[17:43.120 --> 17:51.880]  In the current state, we first need to inform Muir near that we want to do this Aristotle
[17:51.880 --> 17:55.960]  decentralized moderation in our room.
[17:55.960 --> 18:04.480]  And the second thing we need to do is inform element client that we want to opt in for
[18:04.480 --> 18:08.920]  this new feature, which is called report moderators.
[18:08.920 --> 18:13.600]  But once this is done, we can look at that spam.
[18:13.600 --> 18:20.040]  Oh, no, there is spam and report it.
[18:20.040 --> 18:22.840]  This is spam.
[18:22.840 --> 18:34.160]  I don't want no stinky French garlic in my room.
[18:34.160 --> 18:36.760]  And send the report.
[18:36.760 --> 18:41.680]  One thing you may notice if you have recent reports is that we are actually confirming
[18:41.680 --> 18:44.360]  that it has been sent to the moderator.
[18:44.360 --> 18:51.520]  And also, this report now shows up for all the moderators in the rooms instead of only
[18:51.520 --> 18:58.320]  showing up for the home server admin who might or might not be in good position to do anything
[18:58.320 --> 19:01.160]  about it.
[19:01.160 --> 19:19.800]  And let's end, you know, the moderator has, without having to do anything, a very complicated,
[19:19.800 --> 19:29.080]  kicked Marvin from the room and removed the offending message.
[19:29.080 --> 19:36.760]  The reason for which Aristotle is not entirely streamlined yet is because, at the moment,
[19:36.760 --> 19:41.880]  it uses non-standard extensions to the matrix plural.
[19:41.880 --> 19:44.400]  These extensions are pretty simple.
[19:44.400 --> 19:49.920]  They have been submitted for standardization, but they're not part of the standard yet.
[19:49.920 --> 19:56.840]  Once they are, it becomes possible to enable them by default in element and in other clients
[19:56.840 --> 20:02.160]  to enable them by default in merely a role, which means that all the messy parts about
[20:02.160 --> 20:07.840]  setting up the room and setting up element to do that will disappear.
[20:07.840 --> 20:15.640]  And users can simply call for help using a much more streamlined mechanism that actually
[20:15.640 --> 20:20.760]  gets the request for help to the person who can do something about it.
[20:20.760 --> 20:25.880]  Now, let's take a step back.
[20:25.880 --> 20:32.800]  The development of Mjolnir for all and Aristotle is very advanced, but it's not entirely finished.
[20:32.800 --> 20:35.640]  So it's still need a little work.
[20:35.640 --> 20:41.040]  This is work that started its life in the former trust and safety development team at
[20:41.040 --> 20:42.920]  Element.
[20:42.920 --> 20:48.840]  Right now, it lives at the address I'm giving you on this slide.
[20:48.840 --> 20:54.640]  And my hope is that it's going to continue living and progressing because I believe that
[20:54.640 --> 21:02.480]  it can make a whole lot of change for users on matrix network and possibly even on other
[21:02.480 --> 21:04.480]  networks.
[21:04.480 --> 21:12.000]  Well, we are reaching the end of this presentation.
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.000]  I would like to thank you all for listening to this point.
[21:17.000 --> 21:23.160]  As mentioned previously, if you know potential employers for highly passionate developers
[21:23.160 --> 21:29.680]  who enjoy working on privacy, open source and distributed computing, please do not hesitate
[21:29.680 --> 21:31.320]  to get in touch.
[21:31.320 --> 21:38.240]  These are all our GitHub handles, but you can also find us on matrix that shouldn't
[21:38.240 --> 21:39.240]  be too hard.
[21:39.240 --> 21:42.200]  Thank you very much and have a good day.
[21:53.160 --> 21:54.160]  Thank you.
[21:54.160 --> 21:54.160]  Bye.
