The talk given at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was an introduction to asynchronous programming in Python. The speaker discussed the motivation behind writing a Telegram spam bot and the need for a scalable and stable bot that runs 24/7. They explained the three different models of execution in Python: synchronous, thread-based, and asynchronous. The speaker emphasized the benefits of async programming, such as efficient use of resources and easy scalability. They also introduced the concepts of coroutines and event loops in async programming. The speaker mentioned various modules and packages in the async ecosystem, including asyncio, UV loop, Trio, FastAPI, and Tornado. They concluded the talk by sharing their experience of writing the Telegram bot and the positive results it achieved in handling spam signups. The main takeaway from the talk was to give async programming a try.
