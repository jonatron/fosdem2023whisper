{"text": " Hi, everyone. Welcome to the community deaf room and to my talk. I want to talk to you about a meetup that I ran for many, many months and sometimes there were also many, many months in between different meetup events because we all had lives and things to do and it was during pandemic time. But it was a live streamed meetup about open source topics and about basically everything in open source, so licensing, funding, mental health in open source, all kinds of different programming languages. We invited some of the maintainers of those languages to talk to us about that language and its community. And we started it basically because we wanted to just learn more and what better way to just invite people to chat to. So there were no scheduled talks or anything. It was just panel discussions and trying to learn more about those type of communities and those type of initiatives. Oh, that went a little far. So a 2021 tight lived survey that you might have seen surveyed 400 open source maintainers and found that 46% of maintainers are not paid at all. 26% earn more than $1,000 per year for maintenance work and 59% have quit or have considered quitting, maintaining the project and missing lack of financial compensation as their top reason for disliking being a maintainer. Now in yesterday too there were a lot of talks about funding open source maintainers and that it might not be the primary reason for open source maintainers being open source maintainers but in the end of the day we do need to pay for stuff and it's nice if you are able to pay for that stuff. But you know like beyond the projects that are maintained by the proverbial single individual in Nebraska there are a lot of other reasons for open source projects going bad and I would like to share some of those stories that I found from the contributing today meet up basically straight from the horse's mouth and hopefully it will all help us create more healthy communities. Alright so who am I? My name is Floor. I'm currently staff developer advocate at Ivan. Previously I was in developer relations roles at Grafana Labs and Microsoft and a whole bunch of open source developer tooling companies. I am a member of the DevOps days core team and I organized DevOps days or co-organized DevOps days Amsterdam and I'm in Microsoft MPP for developer technologies hence my question to Matt about community ambassador programs and I organize way too many meetups contributing today is just one of them so I have very little free time but if I have free time I spend it with my chickens and my dog and my son not necessarily in the order but all of those things. Alright so I love this quote from Rain Leander and I'm just going to say that they said this on the show I don't think they did but there were definitely I guess I'm contributing today multiple times but it just gives it a little bit more gravitas if we pretend that this was said at the meetup and they said that a project is only as healthy as its community. Community is at the core of any successful project without community a project is only technically open source because of its license but can't read the benefits of innovation consistent release cycle and faster response to current trends and market needs and my own introduction to open source was a very very positive one. I had decided that I want to learn Ruby on Rails and to the end I started following the Rails Girls guides and I found that I would get stuck on something because the guy didn't cover how I needed to do something for my specific setup that I needed to install an extra something something and I figured out that I could Google what I should do that and that is called troubleshooting so I felt really important and then I could go into the guides and change it so that someone else wouldn't get stuck on the same issue and I thought that was fantastic so someone somewhere in the world that I didn't know could benefit from me failing that first time and then fixing something and I was entirely sold on open source so while that was a wonderful first experience I also had a lot of dreadful experiences being in open source and I want to sort of and that was also the intention of contributing today I wanted to figure out you know like how can we recognize those sort of bad experiences that we might likely find in some projects and maybe mitigate it or at least be aware of those so that we can avoid those communities like the plague all right so in the meantime you know like fast forward a little bit I had learned Ruby on Rails I worked for a couple of different companies in the open source space I had been part of a couple of open source communities and you start recognizing sort of red flags early on so you do that by looking at code of conduct figuring out if the code of conduct is at the root of a repository for projects if there is persons that I can contact if I experience something that is not what I was expecting or hoping for or that there's just a generic email address or no contact details because that's that happens if they have a contributing file do I know if going to the project what I can contribute to does it set me up for me and my contribution to be a success do I know what they're looking for I would look at the makeup of the contributors pool do I recognize anyone does it look kind of diverse to me a helpful read me is certainly a really good sign I would look at responsiveness so how long are issues or pull requests typically open before they're responded to and then also the general tone are people thanks for their contributions or can they expect really abrasive answers and not really any love so I would look at those type of things and I as I got more into open source you tend to build relationships and you would hear from the hallway which projects are the ones that you should maybe contribute your time to and which you maybe shouldn't and you look at other things like do maintainers and Matt also sort of alluded to this in your earlier talk do they grant sort of like recognition for people making contributions do they offer some sort of mentoring so some more to newer people in the open source project do they spend some of their time mentoring newcomers to the project do if I come to a project with a with a and I file an issue someone picking these up and sort of mentoring me through making sure that that is going to be a wonderful PR in the end and do they promote active contributors to maybe maintainers with commit access so that was also like some of the good signs that you could find alright in 2017 there was a open source survey that never got repeated sadly maybe they thought that the state of the Octaverse is the thing that sort of like replaced this and it was by GitHub and a couple of other companies and it was a collective responses from 5,500 respondents from over 3,800 open source repositories and GitHub and then 500 respondents from different platforms than GitHub and the results are an open data set set about among other things their experiences of those who use and build and maintain open source software the main takeaways I'm just going to read them out because we're not sure the people in the live stream can actually see this live so you know like they're just relying on my voice sorry documentation is highly valued frequently overlooked and a means for establishing inclusive and accessible communities negative interactions are infrequent but highly visible and with consequences for project activity open source is used by the whole world but its contributors don't reflect its broad audience yet using and contributing to open source often happens on the job and open source is a default when choosing software and I want to focus mostly on the top two findings of that report so I want to focus on the interactions and accessibility but in no means I'm negating all the other points from the survey alright from that survey nearly like 18% of respondents indicate that they have personally experienced a negative interaction with another user in open source and 50% have witnessed it between other people and negative experiences really have consequences for a project's health communities health 21% of people who experienced or witnessed a negative behavior set that they have stopped contributing to a project because of it and 8 of them started to work in private channels more often which is also something that we definitely do not want so a little bit of the breakdown of the behaviors that were seen so by far the most frequently encountered bad behavior is rudeness 45% witness 60% experienced follow it by name calling 20% witness 5% experienced stereotyping 11% witness 3% experienced and more serious events like sexual harassment stalking or doxing are each encountered by less than 5% of the respondents and experienced by less than 2% but grouped together experience witnessed by 14% and experienced by 3% and now when you think all of the survey was from 2017 surely it's gotten better by now I have bad news for you a report from on this foundation from 2021 that looks at diversity inclusion equity and inclusion in open source didn't bring a much better results than the 2017 one it's still a very toxic place to be and especially for marginalized folks it is a difficult space to navigate all right so in developer relations you asked for a raise of hands I don't know how many people raise their hands but in developer relations we have a couple of tools that measure community activity more so that's you mentioned orbit common room but they look more at you know where are your influencers right and what is what kind of like activity is taking place but looking at open source metrics I looked at two things like the chaos as an initiative in this space to measure community health chaos is a Linux foundation project that is focused and I quote from the website so they get it right creating metrics metrics models and software to better understand the open source community health on a global scale chaos if you don't know is an acronym for community health analytics in open source software and of course chaos gone to place this last Friday and chaos understands community health as the potential that an open source software community continues developing quality software chaos is helping through all kinds of things like templates for readme's and code of conduct and a wonderful terminology sheets so like they're doing a good job and then detergize in the same space of course is another company in that space that according to their website they improve decision-making and reporting by analyzing software development community activity and performance of open source projects and they do so across patches and forums and meetings and all kinds of stuff and a October no sorry August 22 report looks at the communities open source ecosystem and I didn't necessarily want to know more about community health in the communities space but sidestep I do like a quote from Sarah Novotny from the time that she let the company communities community group at Google now of course she works for Microsoft because they all move around and she mentioned how the chop wood carry water is not only like sort of like a phrase that they say in the communities community a lot but it's actually a core tenant all of the projects and they want to make sure that everyone that anyone that is coming to the communities community is doing so to help the project and not help their company forward or be in the communities community for their own sort of like nefarious agenda so they they keep saying this phrase and they make sure that whenever someone is coming into the project with PR or anything that doesn't sort of align with what the community wants they will make sure that they they are very aware of that so they spend a lot of time actually doing the sort of unglamorous stuff like thanking individuals for their variety of contributions and not only when it includes code but any other contribution too and in its basics they are seeing this as a way to you know like pay that forward that that's sort of like that field and when someone does enter the project with this I don't know 10k line PR they they're made aware of Google's developer relation manager Ajah Hammerleys quote we don't do that here if you haven't read the blog where Ajah explains what that means you should definitely have a look at it but sort of the gist of it is Ajah says if you run a meetup or a team if you lead an open source project or if you organize an event people will be looking at you to know what is okay and what isn't you get a responsibility whether you want it or not it's yours and we don't do that here is a polite a firm way to educate a newcomer about your culture back to the report so Baterja the looks when they look at community health they look at a couple of things so one of the things is responsiveness as the time to solve issues and pull requests or merge requests as well as the average commits per day a lower average response time indicates a higher performance in the ecosystem the complexity as determined by the number of code repositories and the number of people involved an increasing number of repositories indicates in increasing complexity makes sense activity diversity as in number of commits issues patches requests and over a period of time and when and where that activity takes place sort of shows how the ecosystem is distributed they look at how talent is managed in the open source ecosystem and they try and analyze a different contribution different aspects of code contributor growth so they identify the contributor retention rate so the contributors that remain engaged and sort of the bounce rate so people that leave the projects and they look at the bus factor definitely feel like many people in the room should be aware of that factor but is the sort of minimum number of team members that should be engaged with the projects for it to have long term sustainability and they look at community footprint to and that's an interesting one it's the presence or an influence of organizations within the open source ecosystem so one of them that they look at is the gamma factor that's the amount of contributors that use a gmail account and are likely not contributing from sort of like a professional standpoint the elephant factor the minimum number of email domains whose employees perform 50% of the total contributions and they look at contribution patterns so for instance are a lot of the contributions done during the week or during the weekend if there are many of them are done by the during the weekend and likely there's a lot of individual volunteers contributors that are still contributing to the project right to a couple of the lessons learned from talking to these 50 plus maintainers one important thing that kept coming back in all of these meetings is how important it is to set expectations so the side story of the we don't do that here in the communities community is a way to model behavior and you want to be doing that so if problematic behavior as the ones that are described in the open source survey from 2017 for instance take place it is paramount to address those swiftly but but definitely publicly because you want to set that tone you want to show the behavior that you're looking for you want to model that behavior and there's ways to automate a couple of the things that you expect from people entering your community too so if you find yourself asking people that send you a pull request to elaborate on a pull request even just like even just after one or two times and maybe you want to make sure that you have PR and issue templates available so that they know what is expected what you are looking for in order for you to be able to actually review that that pull request so a lot of that expectation setting is something that you can automate too and of course licenses are a way to set expectations too right and we actually had two different contributing today meetups that were talking about licenses and most recent one was with clearly defined tight lived open source initiative and the ethical source movement and I learned a couple of wonderful things one of them actually if you're married to a lawyer apparently you can also give legal advice I don't think I was allowed to quote that one but another thing is that combining licenses for one project is definitely possible and I'm not talking like one one license for the code and then one license for documentation but combining licenses is possible but it's mostly good for lawyers and not for the project necessarily because you're just introducing complexity you will want to choose a license that is standard in in sort of the ecosystem that you're you're in so if everyone's using Apache maybe you want to use Apache to in your sort of like language ecosystem for instance and if you're thinking about building a business around your project maybe ultimately you need to choose wisely we talked about CLA's contributor license agreements a lot in one of those meetups and how if you haven't done that it's absolutely a pain to do real real licensing because you will need to contact all of your contributors and some of the it's it's anyway notoriously hard to try and contact your contributors because they often don't have an email address or anything listed on their GitHub profile if that's your platform of choice maybe they have moved on from the project some of them have maybe passed away because that's an actual possibility and then how do you go about that? Either way you would need to do if you do real licensing you would need to do a introduce a breaking change right because you're breaking your API and that can be very divisive in a in a community and some of the community members might refer to like little latest release and fork that one and create a community around that one or totally fine but you need to be aware of that. Also recently at Tech Press there was this project that was that sort of threatened to real license if they didn't get funding which I find an interesting approach to right originally an academic project the Postgres open source stewards are very interested in its extensibility and its ability to merge it with other projects so maybe one of the lessons learned from contributing today is to play well with others make sure that there's connectors integrations that sort of extensibility is an interesting thing and people look for that. Some organizations that are involved in open source have great policies internally or maybe in Ospo and usually that means that employees can make contributions to the upstream project during working hours which ensures activity on the project. They're professionally involved so maybe they also wear their professional hat I'm hoping and hopefully it means that they don't they're not just there with their professional sort of goggles on. You might want to steer away from single vendor support most all projects accept help and contributions from service providers we'll know that they're hyperscalers and some of them definitely appear on paper as the champion supporters of a project but the future requests can never outweigh whatever the community wants importance. A side tangent and I promise this is probably the last one but recognize red flags whenever a company is looking to pay you for your open source contributions or pay you as a maintainer and make very very sure that you don't have to subject yourself to the same OCRs as they have for the rest of their engineering organization because companies work at a very different pace and with you know financial years then open source does and it's important to know that. Sticking with Postgres for a little bit contributor experience is a very important thing I remember that Gregory Stark I don't know if he's in the room maybe not maybe he's still sleeping he mentioned that his first contribution to Postgres was a very positive one and that's something that made him want to contribute more for the long term. It can make all the difference in terms of gaining long term contributors for your project if that first experience is a good one my first experience with Rails was a wonderful one because of Rails Girls and remember that 2017 open source survey and how it said that documentation is highly valued frequently overlooked and a means for establishing inclusive and accessible communities? Well from the contributing to date meetup panels on docs often the conclusions were that it's important to create documentation in a market language that other people know so that they can review it maybe also contribute to it so if they find an issue like getting stuck on a certain something something in the Rails Girls guide you can contribute to the project and that at minimum the setup needs to be documented that people can usually tinker beyond the setup but that first step needs to be a good one and to be clear and concise to avoid jargon and if you use jargon then offer glossary maybe. I also love this quote about non-code contributions that triaging and labeling is a contribution too. Projects need to think about the different reasons for people to contribute to open source and they can address those different motivations with appropriate work. Matt said this when Matt was on our show too. So open source is a marathon it's not a sprint and marathons need sponsors sprints do too you can ask me how I know my son runs and I need to get sponsors for this because I said I do sponsors for for conferences I can definitely find sponsors for your sprints and we've had several contributing today's sessions around funding open source work and I thought this we invited Toby Langall from Unlock Open he's very known for saying things that are a little controversial maybe but it's good so companies making money of people's work without paying them is a huge liability something that he said which can't agree more and he continued that people don't understand what it takes to run a business or an open source project for that matter and nobody scrutinizes companies for providing healthcare or I don't know bathrooms for their employees so why are we looking putting putting maintainers on such a you know under such scrutiny from that same episode Phoebe Quincy was a senior community relations manager at Digital Ocean said that there's many projects that need your help more than the community's project even if you rely on the community's project a lot for to get your your your stuff done and also added that Hector Perfest in more recent years is actually looking to promote some of the smaller sort of like plumbing projects that really would need your help and that could use your help through using Open Collective or GitHub sponsors or any of the sort that sort of program Estelle well who's a technical senior technical writer and community engineer at Open Web Dogs also said that most sponsoring programs are small pockets of money just enough to cover server costs but still we treat that as this big thing Phoebe from Digital Ocean I quoted her before said that false funds award lump sums large amount of money and the next challenge is doing that consistently we found that you know sometimes projects get a lot of money in the one month and then nothing the next and how do you even balance that and yeah and we feel like this is this wonderful thing by the way like 10k is this huge amount of money while what do we pay software engineers at our companies in 2021 we had a very similar conversation with Babel Maysainer Henry who mentioned that he is scrutinized for by by the community for going on podcasts and doing marketing for the project to try and get more donations in while he should be working on the project and so he feels like he should be spending more time doing coding while that might actually not be what this is the best interest of the community and the Babel project and while a normal company would like to have a runway maybe when you're running an open source project that that sometimes feels like sending the wrong signal because why why are you not you were doing the work before while you were not paid for it so now that you're paid for it like you need to do xyz and this sort of like ties into a whole sort of toxic notion of we have this really romantic view of the open source maintainer that is in the basement of their mom you know like deprived of sunlight and just like suffering and only then are you a true you know unspoiled hacker but it's ridiculous like so for anyone who does want to pay a mortgage doesn't want to work at a company doesn't want to give their project away to foundation so for valid reasons I'm sure there is this website called oss.fund there's a lot of different ways to fund your project more consistently but the FOSS contributor survey from 2020 by the Linux foundation I feel like I'm sponsored by the Linux foundation a little I loved our talk yesterday too in the Janssen room the closing talk summarized the results of survey of free open source software developers with a goal to identify key issues in improving security and sustainability of open source and found that vast majority of respondents that nearly 75 percent are employed full-time so that definitely goes into you know like breaks with that romantic notion of the person in the basement and survey found that over half of respondents are paid to contribute to FOSS which I mean great and usually we're a little bit concerned about corporate involvement in FOSS projects but there's a lot that we can do there remember when I talked about mentorship like some of these people that are paid to contribute to open source maybe they can fulfill that role of the mentorship for new contributors and of course Linux foundation suggests to maybe move to a foundation with neutral governance to ensure diversity of organizations and control but of course the next foundation would say that wouldn't they all right I'm drawing through clothes I promise the previously mentioned report found that all types of contributors reported that they spent very little of their time responding to security issues and when I say very little I wonder what number you have in your mind but it's 2.27 percent of their time of the total time that they spend on the project they spend on security issues and also they indicated they have no intention of increasing that amount of time to spend on security issues instead they're looking at organizations to help them with free security audits with contributions for security and so that's something for anyone in this room that is working for a company that allows you to spend time on open source is something that maybe you can bring some of your expertise or you can find some of your friends in security departments and see if you can get them to help you out on that one I'd be remiss of course to not talk about the slity of our supply change your transitive dependencies are part of your wonderful community garden and it's imperative that you at least observe them and observe the health of that components that are literally your foundation all right in conclusion I wouldn't dare to suggest that open source is sick but I think we can all do better at taking some of our vitamins so collaboration between strangers is one of the most remarkable aspects of open source and if we can all be better stewards for all of that so set expectations upgrade your own boarding improve your contributor experience check your dependencies floss and prepare to do that all over again every single day thank you so much thank you very much", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek":
