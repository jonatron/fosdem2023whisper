The talk was about two projects, Metal LB and FRR, and their integration. Metal LB is a community project under the CNCF umbrella that aims to solve the issues of assigning external IPs and routing traffic in Kubernetes clusters on bare metal servers. It provides a solution for load balancing traffic to nodes in a cluster and also offers stable IPs that can be used to access applications from outside the cluster. Metal LB works by either using L2 mode or BGP mode, with the latter leveraging BGP-enabled routers to advertise routes. The BGP mode integration was done by utilizing FRR, an Internet Routing Protocol Suite for Linux that already implemented the features needed for Metal LB. The talk also touched on the challenges faced during the integration and mentioned that a proper CI mechanism was set up using kind to test the configurations and ensure stability.
