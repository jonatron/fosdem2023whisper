In this talk, Norbert Poč discussed hybrid public key encryption (HPK), a symmetric and f-symmetric scheme that uses a key encapsulation mechanism for key exchange. Poč discussed the fundamentals of the HPK scheme, algorithms in use, and how it works. He also discussed if and how HPK can be used with post-quantum cryptography, exploring the security and benchmarking the performance associated with each.
