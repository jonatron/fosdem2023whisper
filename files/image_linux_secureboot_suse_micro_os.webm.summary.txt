The talk discussed open-source and MicroS, and covered topics including update and rollback mechanisms, configuration file management, and full disk encryption and trusted boot. MicroS is a read-only root file system that contains a minimal package selection for single-purpose use cases. It is based on the rolling release Tumbleweed and stable Leap distributions, and relies on the BTRFS file system for snapshots and copy-on-write functionality during updates. The system is self-maintaining and includes a health checker for automatic rollbacks if necessary. The talk also discussed the use of the LibEcon library for handling problematic files, and the relationship between MicroS and SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro.
