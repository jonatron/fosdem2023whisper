The talk presented by Nicola Roland from Gustave F.L. University focused on their research on crowdsourced zone data and analysis they did using free open-source software to understand traffic noise as a major health concern and its impact on social cost in Europe. They discussed the challenges of measuring noise levels everywhere and presented the use of the Humara Lab's smartphone application to measure and share sound environments and generate noise maps. They also used the available data set to analyze the sound environment of users and find correlations between users' physical environments and their sound tags. They concluded that reproducible science is essential for such research, and open source free software plays a critical role in achieving it. They also emphasized the need to make the data usable, which could effectively address some of the biases present in crowdsourced data. Overall, the study demonstrated the potential of utilizing crowdsourced noise data to create more accurate and efficient noise maps.
