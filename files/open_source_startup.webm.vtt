00:00.000 --> 00:11.080
Hi, everyone. My name is Tom, and today I'll be talking to you about starting an open-source

00:11.080 --> 00:17.800
startup. So about this talk, it's directed at early-stage startups or people thinking

00:17.800 --> 00:22.360
about starting one with an open-source product or people thinking about open-sourcing the

00:22.360 --> 00:26.600
existing product. If you were here for the previous talk, it was more about the step

00:26.600 --> 00:29.720
one to step two. Here I'm going to talk about the zero to one. You don't have a product

00:29.720 --> 00:35.640
yet, you're just starting out. And so what is an early-stage startup? For the purpose

00:35.640 --> 00:41.280
of this talk, it's an early-stage company that's designed to grow fast, often backed

00:41.280 --> 00:48.640
by venture capitalists, so investors, and aiming for very high revenue. You have to remember,

00:48.640 --> 00:52.560
and maybe it's important to frame the rest of the talk around this, is that this is a

00:52.560 --> 00:56.680
capitalistic endeavor. You're taking money from people, and you're promising them to

00:56.680 --> 01:01.240
return them more money after a certain amount of time. And you have to remember that all

01:01.240 --> 01:05.120
for our thing. It's something that's so easy to forget, but that's the basis for everything

01:05.120 --> 01:10.060
else. And it's especially easy for us to forget, because we're so used to giving so much free

01:10.060 --> 01:14.720
value to the world with our open-source contribution, and also taking a lot of free value back by

01:14.720 --> 01:19.320
using Linux, by using KDE, by using all of these tools. But if you're out there building

01:19.320 --> 01:24.320
a business, taking money from investors, that's something that is important to remember.

01:24.320 --> 01:29.560
So who am I? I'm the founder and CEO of Sviks. It's a company. We started as a business,

01:29.560 --> 01:33.520
and then open-source the product, although that was the intention from the beginning,

01:33.520 --> 01:37.960
and also created EtiSync that started as an open-source project, and then turned into a

01:37.960 --> 01:43.320
business. I'm obsessed with API, developer tools, been around for a while, worked on

01:43.320 --> 01:50.160
Elightment, OpenMoco, and a few other projects as well. So what is Sviks? We do webhook sending

01:50.160 --> 01:55.400
as a service. It's an API-first developer tool. We help companies send webhooks, essentially.

01:55.400 --> 02:00.440
It's both open-core, hand-on-oaster product, as we do both. We raise over $10 million from

02:00.440 --> 02:05.440
top investors, including Y Combinator, and Treason Horowitz, RF, and founders and CTOs

02:05.440 --> 02:12.040
of companies such as GitHub, PagetGT, Segment, Lookout, and Fly.io. So why am I even giving

02:12.040 --> 02:16.320
this talk? So there are a lot of resources for how to start a startup online. A lot of

02:16.320 --> 02:20.760
great resources. But there aren't a lot of resources for open-source startups, especially

02:20.760 --> 02:25.200
not ones that come from the community, from people that actually understand open-source.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.720
It's more like an opportunistic approach that a lot of people take. And also, a lot of people

02:29.720 --> 02:35.320
have been asking me for advice over the years, even this weekend. I figured, why not? Let's

02:35.320 --> 02:38.640
make a deck out of it.

02:38.640 --> 02:43.720
So before we begin, why even start a startup? I saw a talk by one of the co-founders of

02:43.720 --> 02:47.600
Facebook many years ago, and it really resonated with me, especially now that I've seen other

02:47.600 --> 02:52.640
people start companies, I've started companies myself. And a lot of people think it's cool.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.760
Your vision is that you're going to hit launch, you just finish building a product, you get

02:55.760 --> 03:00.560
press attention, go wakeboarding with Obama, or I don't know what you want to do, Rockstar.

03:00.560 --> 03:04.320
But the reality is that no one is actually going to care at all. You're going to beg them

03:04.320 --> 03:08.880
for press attention, you're going to beg customers to use your shitty product, and really, honestly,

03:08.880 --> 03:13.320
you don't have time for press and all of the Rockstar stuff anyway, you're building a business.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.800
And also, a lot of people think that they want to be the boss, you know, big office,

03:16.800 --> 03:20.840
private steam room, make a billion dollar deals, private jets, all of that stuff. In

03:20.840 --> 03:25.520
reality, it's a noisy co-working space, if you're lucky, most likely a kitchen counter,

03:25.520 --> 03:28.960
and begging people to try a product again and fighting for survival. So it's really

03:28.960 --> 03:34.480
not that, it's not like what you think. Another thing people think, well, I'm my own boss,

03:34.480 --> 03:40.040
I'm going to have flexibility. I love this quote, as an entrepreneur, you get some flexibility,

03:40.040 --> 03:44.600
you get to choose which 24 hours of the day you work on. It's so true, and for a variety

03:44.600 --> 03:47.680
of reasons, first of all, your customers are demanding, and you want to make sure that

03:47.680 --> 03:51.360
they're served right, you don't want to lose that deal just because you're unavailable,

03:51.360 --> 03:56.200
even though it's your wife's birthday or some other occasion. And the other reason is, you're

03:56.200 --> 03:59.080
really obsessed with what you're building, so you're actually thinking about it all the

03:59.080 --> 04:02.240
time anyway, and you have ideas in the shower, and you have ideas during dinner, and you're

04:02.240 --> 04:07.640
just dying to go back and kind of like put that into reality.

04:07.640 --> 04:11.520
Another bad reason is that you want to have more impact. Honestly, just join an early

04:11.520 --> 04:14.920
stage startup, you're going to be working on a product that's already well funded, doing

04:14.920 --> 04:19.440
well, and you're going to grow with the team, become the CTO maybe, it's like, you know,

04:19.440 --> 04:25.080
it's a great path, or a late stage company. You know, I worked at Samsung, my code was,

04:25.080 --> 04:28.920
you know, it's been used by millions and millions of people, or at least devices. That's much

04:28.920 --> 04:33.320
more impact than any of my companies have reached, you know, so far. So that's just

04:33.320 --> 04:39.000
something to keep in mind. Another thing, you want to get rich. That's not a good reason,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.240
because the likelihood of success is very low. You're most likely going to have like a really

04:43.240 --> 04:48.160
low salary for many years, and then you're going to go bust. Not a good strategy if you

04:48.160 --> 04:53.480
want to make money. Again, join an early stage startup, a premium 50 at Facebook, for example,

04:53.480 --> 04:58.760
is a multi-multi-multi-millionaire, or just work at Facebook, Google, all of those companies.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.000
Again, I don't recommend, but if this is what you want, then you're just chasing money,

05:02.000 --> 05:06.600
you can do that. And you have to remember, it's going to be absolutely brutal. So things

05:06.600 --> 05:10.720
are going to go wrong, deals are going to go full through, you're going to get a lot

05:10.720 --> 05:14.320
of nose from candidates, from investors, from literally everyone, all the time. You're going

05:14.320 --> 05:18.160
to want to quit, but because you're the founder, that means that if you quit, the company is

05:18.160 --> 05:21.600
going to close, and that means your employees are going to lose their job, and your investors

05:21.600 --> 05:25.600
are going to lose the money invested. So you're really like, it's really hard to quit as a

05:25.600 --> 05:31.760
founder. Okay, so we covered all the budget stuff. So why actually start a startup? And

05:31.760 --> 05:35.920
there are a few good reasons. One, you really care about the problem. You want to cure cancer.

05:35.920 --> 05:40.440
No one else is like, cracked it yet. You think you have a shot? Go for it. You're really

05:40.440 --> 05:44.560
passionate about your idea. You have, I don't know, Uber for cats, terrible idea, but like,

05:44.560 --> 05:48.880
this is something that you really care about, and you want to get, because everyone thinks

05:48.880 --> 05:52.320
it's terrible, I guess, for the laughs. Like, no one else is going to build it. You decide

05:52.320 --> 05:57.040
to build it yourself. And you just want to start, maybe, your own company. You just,

05:57.040 --> 06:00.600
I don't know, whatever reason, this is what you want to do. And just make sure that your

06:00.600 --> 06:06.320
motivation is long lasting, because you're going to need it for the next 10 years. Another

06:06.320 --> 06:11.400
good reason, a bit more altruistic, is that open source startups are good for the community.

06:11.400 --> 06:15.800
Much more money and talent into open source, great open source products. You know, we're

06:15.800 --> 06:20.560
all going to use them every day. And also, open source startups tend to support the rest

06:20.560 --> 06:24.760
of the community. We support other projects, both financially and by upstreaming patches.

06:24.760 --> 06:30.920
We also employ the maintainer of, like, Redis Rust. And so, again, great for the ecosystem.

06:30.920 --> 06:34.520
But you have to remember, there are other alternatives. You can join a promising startup. You can

06:34.520 --> 06:39.840
start a non-VC backed startup, much less of the stress that I mentioned. You can start

06:39.840 --> 06:43.960
a side business. I've done that. It's great, much less stressful, still stressful, but

06:43.960 --> 06:48.560
much less. Or you can just start an open source project. Again, I've done that. Many people

06:48.560 --> 06:51.760
in this room, I'm sure, have done it as well. It's a great way to just, you know, put something

06:51.760 --> 06:56.680
out there without the pressure of actually having returns. And so, really, just, like,

06:56.680 --> 07:00.400
be true to yourself and what you want, because, you know, you need to know what you're signing

07:00.400 --> 07:07.000
up for. So, let's talk about getting started. The first step in the journey is validating

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
your idea. So, is this a problem that people even care about? Are you the right team to

07:11.000 --> 07:14.960
build it? How will you make money? How will you get customers? How big is the opportunity?

07:14.960 --> 07:18.600
You need to constantly validate your riskiest assumptions in order to not go, you know,

07:18.600 --> 07:23.160
like head on the wrong direction. I highly recommend filling in the white combinator application.

07:23.160 --> 07:27.560
Like, white combinator is like an accelerator. Even if you don't submit it, it just forces

07:27.560 --> 07:32.760
you to think very thoroughly about the business from the eyes of investors and from a business

07:32.760 --> 07:38.280
perspective. And it's been, like, very helpful for me. And you know how people say there

07:38.280 --> 07:45.600
are no bad ideas? There are definitely bad ideas. Some threads of common bad ideas are

07:45.600 --> 07:53.320
the ones that are very obvious. So, for example, oh, I'm going to start a startup for teleportation.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.200
Great idea. I'm sure all of you guys are going to, like, pay instead of, like, taking the

07:56.200 --> 08:01.200
flight back home. But the problem is it's actually technically difficult or impossible.

08:01.200 --> 08:07.120
That's why no one has started it. So, you know, it's the first step of validation. The other

08:07.120 --> 08:10.680
type of bad ideas is when you have a solution, you build a project, you're really excited

08:10.680 --> 08:14.600
by it. That's what you want to work on. The problem is it's not applicable to everything.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.400
I don't have a good example from the top of my head, but there are many of them. And I'm

08:18.400 --> 08:23.720
sure, you know, like, the more crypto, you know, crypto, God, haters will use the crypto

08:23.720 --> 08:31.400
as an example for that. Also, another one, I get pitched a lot of ideas about, you know,

08:31.400 --> 08:36.520
spaces that the two B founders know nothing about. You know, I know nothing about cancer

08:36.520 --> 08:40.640
research. I'm not going to start a cancer research company. And one last thing, which

08:40.640 --> 08:44.920
is actually not a bad signal, people telling you that it's bad. And that's, you know, going

08:44.920 --> 08:48.360
back to, like, why doesn't exist? Because everyone thinks it's bad. And that's where

08:48.360 --> 08:55.800
your opportunity lies. So, just ignore the naysayers. I asked Paul, like, the co-founder

08:55.800 --> 09:00.880
and CEO of Superbase, what's his best advice? And he said, everything should be open source,

09:00.880 --> 09:05.320
but not every open source should be a business. And that's so true. Again, validate, verify

09:05.320 --> 09:12.640
that what you're building is actually a good business. In the now immortal words of Y Combinator,

09:12.640 --> 09:17.240
you need to make something that people want. That's it. So, when you start, all you need

09:17.240 --> 09:22.280
to be focusing on is writing code, showing it to customers, getting feedback, talking

09:22.280 --> 09:25.680
to them, all of that. You know, in the open source world, we now release early, release

09:25.680 --> 09:32.320
often. That's how you get things to the back hands of customers or users and you get feedback.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.480
It's much better to find a few that really love what you're doing than many people that

09:36.480 --> 09:40.520
are, eh, because the few that love, really love it, are going to tell their friends about

09:40.520 --> 09:44.080
it. And the few that are okay about it are going to stop using it after a certain period

09:44.080 --> 09:50.280
of time. Also, 90-10 solution. So, find how you make the most impact with the less amount

09:50.280 --> 09:55.520
of time. Like, perfection is really the enemy of good here. And the last thing, you want

09:55.520 --> 09:59.880
to do things that don't scale. So, what do I mean by that? There are, like, certain activities

09:59.880 --> 10:03.280
that you can do at this stage of the company that are definitely not going to work once

10:03.280 --> 10:08.160
you have a billion users. But for now, you can do them. So, one example from our, from

10:08.160 --> 10:14.120
the beginning of Svix is that I used to send the API keys encrypted to our customers. We

10:14.120 --> 10:18.200
didn't have a sign-up flow. There was no need, right? I don't know if anyone wants the company

10:18.200 --> 10:22.440
or wants the product. So, like, why build a sign-up pro? Why build a landing page? None

10:22.440 --> 10:26.880
of these things matter in the beginning. So, just focus on the product.

10:26.880 --> 10:31.480
Another great quote that I love is from Steve Jobs. So, everything around you that you call

10:31.480 --> 10:36.240
life was made by people that were no smarter than you are. And you can change it, you can

10:36.240 --> 10:40.840
influence it, and you can build your own things that other people can use. So, it's really,

10:40.840 --> 10:45.480
don't be scared because it looks, you know, it seems difficult. Just, like, go for it.

10:45.480 --> 10:52.560
Really just go for it. So, before you start, ignore the naysayers, but be honest with yourself.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.400
You know, a lot of people are going to tell you what you're doing is stupid, silly, bad

10:55.400 --> 11:00.640
thing. Maybe they're right. You have to make that call. And effort counts for nothing.

11:00.640 --> 11:04.600
This is not school. If you don't get results, it doesn't matter how hard you work. It doesn't

11:04.600 --> 11:08.320
matter, like, how much you tried. It doesn't matter how cool your code is. It just doesn't

11:08.320 --> 11:13.920
matter. Again, do you risk the business? You have to listen to advice, but decide for yourself.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.400
First of all, it's because it's practice for later stages. You're the only one running

11:16.400 --> 11:20.720
this company. But also, you're the only one with a lot of context about what your customers

11:20.720 --> 11:23.520
want because you've been talking to them all the time. And, like, what doesn't work because

11:23.520 --> 11:27.520
you've been writing the code. So, really, just decide for yourself. And remember that

11:27.520 --> 11:32.320
most startups fail, like the vast majority. So, if you're doing average input, you're

11:32.320 --> 11:36.760
going to get average output, and that means deaf for startup. So, definitely watch out

11:36.760 --> 11:40.760
for that. Okay. I think that was, like, the beginning.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.080
Now we can talk a bit about the product. So, the first and most important thing is understanding

11:45.080 --> 11:50.240
the problem. And you need to know your customers, what they want, what they care about, what

11:50.240 --> 11:54.600
they hate. Really have the curiosity of a child and really get to have, like, as most

11:54.600 --> 11:59.760
empathy as you can. A good hack in the beginning is being your own customer. That really works.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.080
But you also have to make sure that there's a path to other customers that are different

12:03.080 --> 12:06.280
than you are. Because if you're just building, you know, like, I don't know, like, a name

12:06.280 --> 12:09.560
tags that just say the name Tom on them. That's great. But there are just so many Tom's in

12:09.560 --> 12:13.720
the world. I don't think it's, like, a good business.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.800
Another quote, I love quotes, is from Henry Ford. It's asked people what I wanted. They

12:17.800 --> 12:24.120
would have asked for a faster horse. And that means don't, you know, listen to your customers,

12:24.120 --> 12:28.200
learn about their needs and wants. But don't follow blindly. Say no. It's absolutely fine

12:28.200 --> 12:33.880
to say no. You also have to remember it's about what you do. It's not about what you

12:33.880 --> 12:37.840
do. Sorry. It's about what you enable. And so people don't actually care about drills.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.760
I mean, drills are fun. Don't get me wrong. But what they want is holes. And you have

12:41.760 --> 12:45.360
to figure out how you give them a hole. And again, don't, you know, don't obsess on the

12:45.360 --> 12:51.720
fact that you already have a drill. And another part about this is, you know, we talked about

12:51.720 --> 12:57.080
product, and that kind of implies, you know, what people actually use. But really, when

12:57.080 --> 13:00.600
I asked James about his experience, he said something that really resonated, which is

13:00.600 --> 13:06.880
your old company is the product. And actually, Zeno also concurred. And from my own experience,

13:06.880 --> 13:11.000
like, it's, I've lost counts, the amount of products that I really wanted to try. And

13:11.000 --> 13:14.080
I went to their website, and I couldn't understand really what they're doing, but I thought maybe

13:14.080 --> 13:17.400
it's relevant. And I went to their docs, couldn't understand how to get it started, and just

13:17.400 --> 13:21.120
dropped off, even though I'm sure it's actually the perfect product for me. And it's the same

13:21.120 --> 13:26.280
with every other aspect. So, you know, like marketing, customer success, all of those

13:26.280 --> 13:32.080
kind of things. You have to obsess with a customer experience. So obviously, I have great customer

13:32.080 --> 13:36.200
service, as I mentioned, you know, your wife's birthday, but the customer is calling. You

13:36.200 --> 13:40.400
may need to, like, drop for a few minutes. And but much better than having a great customer

13:40.400 --> 13:44.800
service is actually fixing the docs. Like, why should they even have a problem in the

13:44.800 --> 13:48.800
first place? But even better than fixing the docs is just making the product easy to use.

13:48.800 --> 13:54.160
So, you know, same defaults, great onboarding in the product itself. And all of those things

13:54.160 --> 13:59.600
make for a much better experience. Now, I know this doesn't need repeating at FOSDOM,

13:59.600 --> 14:02.440
you know, just like looking in this room or looking even outside with all the stands

14:02.440 --> 14:06.600
of the amazing communities that are powering, you know, this whole event, but maintaining

14:06.600 --> 14:09.480
a healthy community really matters for an open source project, because that's how you

14:09.480 --> 14:13.760
get contributors. That's how you get evangelism. That's how you get all of those things that

14:13.760 --> 14:19.760
later on turn into business goals. As I said, capitalistic talk. I'm not as cynical in real

14:19.760 --> 14:24.680
life, but I'm just like trying, just showing you the connections to business value. And

14:24.680 --> 14:29.960
so be quick to respond to PRs. The most annoying thing, I opened a PR like two years ago. Got

14:29.960 --> 14:34.400
feedback a few months ago. Obviously, never fixed the feedback. I mean, that's ridiculous.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.480
There are tools to help to make sure that you maintain a good community, like Orbit

14:38.480 --> 14:44.480
Love and also the community dev room here at FOSDOM. Okay, so we talked about a product

14:44.480 --> 14:47.680
which maybe some of you know, maybe some of you already built a successful open source

14:47.680 --> 14:53.800
project, but now what we need to remember is that we're actually building a business.

14:53.800 --> 14:58.320
We're no longer just engineers, and we should focus our time on non-engineering tasks, which

14:58.320 --> 15:03.640
is so hard, and I'm going to talk about that in a bit. But the first step is understanding

15:03.640 --> 15:07.640
your business model. And what is a business model? It's just a fancy way of saying how

15:07.640 --> 15:11.640
are you actually going to make money? There are many different models for open source

15:11.640 --> 15:17.240
and many different models for non-open source. Red Hat and Canonical, they're a great example

15:17.240 --> 15:22.640
of selling additional services, so training, support, consulting, packaging, so like packages

15:22.640 --> 15:28.840
literally. Another example is OpenCore. So you release some of the source code as open

15:28.840 --> 15:34.240
source and then proprietary stuff on top. GitLab and RedDisk both do it. Again, very

15:34.240 --> 15:39.160
common. Do a licensing, so cute and free buy they do it. So you have licensed your code

15:39.160 --> 15:43.600
as copy left or something that is not compatible with some companies, and then they pay you

15:43.600 --> 15:49.120
an extra fee to kind of like unlock it and get an enterprise contract. And then you have

15:49.120 --> 15:54.560
managed cloud, SaaS. Oftentimes goes hand in hand with OpenCore when you have your features

15:54.560 --> 16:01.440
only in the SaaS product and again for the enterprise. GitLab and MongoDB both do it.

16:01.440 --> 16:07.800
You can either run a multi-tenant SaaS or you can just run the product for them. And

16:07.800 --> 16:11.600
there was a time that OpenCore was the way to go and then SaaS became the way to go

16:11.600 --> 16:16.480
because the advent of the cloud. And actually OpenCore is getting some traction again because

16:16.480 --> 16:21.880
a lot of people want to sell first with GDPR, all of those kind of things. People are looking

16:21.880 --> 16:29.000
to sell first again. And then another one that's not often talked about is supporting

16:29.000 --> 16:32.840
products and services. So that's kind of like similar to OpenCore, but you're not actually

16:32.840 --> 16:37.000
extending the product, but you're providing services on top of it. So good examples are

16:37.000 --> 16:43.200
GitHub. GitHub has nothing to do with open source, but they're riding on the Git success.

16:43.200 --> 16:48.440
And Android, Google is selling services over an operating system that was open and can

16:48.440 --> 16:55.400
be customizable by many of the, you know, by all the other form manufacturers. You can

16:55.400 --> 16:59.600
also combine multiple models, but you should know what your main driver is. You're an early

16:59.600 --> 17:04.400
stage startup. You probably have like one person or more likely 0.1 person like working

17:04.400 --> 17:10.080
on this stuff. So you really need to focus and see like what's the main driver for you.

17:10.080 --> 17:14.840
And now, because you're building a billion-dollar business, you're going to have a lot of competition.

17:14.840 --> 17:18.320
Other people are going to see your success. They're going to see your opportunity. We have

17:18.320 --> 17:23.800
numerous copycats that have launched since we started. And you have to figure out like

17:23.800 --> 17:29.000
how do you protect yourself? So there are a few common ways for open source projects.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.320
One way is the license. Obviously, I'm sure those need no introduction here. Copy lefts

17:34.320 --> 17:41.280
or GPL. The problem with those is that oftentimes they're not liked by enterprise lawyers.

17:41.280 --> 17:46.600
So it's really hard to sell to an enterprise if GPL is just banned from that enterprise.

17:46.600 --> 17:50.280
So that's something to watch out for. Then you have the permissive ones, which is what

17:50.280 --> 17:55.960
we chose, but they don't provide any protection. And then you have the non-free or FOPEN, obviously

17:55.960 --> 18:00.920
not open source. I understand where they're coming from. Like seeing AWS just take your

18:00.920 --> 18:06.440
business, host it, and then take all of your revenue stream probably is not fun. I don't

18:06.440 --> 18:10.040
know what I would have done in that situation, but it's definitely, I can see how there's

18:10.040 --> 18:16.240
going to be like more innovation in the licensing space just following the mega-cloud companies.

18:16.240 --> 18:22.040
And the last one is usually, it's like CLAs, usually tied with copyright assignment. And

18:22.040 --> 18:26.160
then when you do do a licensing, you need to actually own the copyright. So contributors

18:26.160 --> 18:31.480
assign the copyright to you, and then you can re-license.

18:31.480 --> 18:37.360
If I asked multiple lawyers and founders, and almost all of them said, own the trademark,

18:37.360 --> 18:42.120
your license is probably too liberal to protect you. And the trademark is the reason why Mozilla

18:42.120 --> 18:47.360
can say, well, you know, like can prevent a competitor from starting Firefox plus plus

18:47.360 --> 18:51.640
or Firefox remix, all of those kind of things, because that is actually confusing to customers.

18:51.640 --> 18:56.000
And that's a good line of defense. And I think like a few years ago, the founder of

18:56.000 --> 19:00.800
own cloud actually gave a talk here at Forstem, and he mentioned that they never had the trademark

19:00.800 --> 19:05.800
for own cloud, and that prevented them from actually, you know, offering a good hosted

19:05.800 --> 19:09.960
service, because there were so many clones, and there were so many people that, you know,

19:09.960 --> 19:14.000
that claimed to be the official one, and it was like really hard for them to actually

19:14.000 --> 19:16.640
maintain control.

19:16.640 --> 19:22.160
Another one is network effects and ecosystem. So if you look at GitHub, or even GitHub,

19:22.160 --> 19:25.480
even though it's not open source, it's just because everyone is there, that means the

19:25.480 --> 19:31.000
new projects are going to be hosted there as well. That's it. It's really tough to break.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.760
But even without, you know, a SaaS component, just think about Postgres. There's so many

19:35.760 --> 19:40.160
libraries for Postgres, and so many utilities for Postgres across many languages, and across

19:40.160 --> 19:45.360
many, like, they're just, the ecosystem is vast, so it's really hard to append Postgres

19:45.360 --> 19:52.480
from where they are. So that's like, again, another good line of defense.

19:52.480 --> 19:56.240
Also remember, you know, plans are worthless. Everything is going to change. You're going

19:56.240 --> 19:59.880
to change your assumption. Everything, it's really in flux. Like, it's hard to understand

19:59.880 --> 20:06.520
how much things, sorry, how to explain how many things change on a single day. But actually,

20:06.520 --> 20:11.040
the process of planning is extremely valuable. You know, I'm going to say a word that probably

20:11.040 --> 20:15.600
sounds scary, which is like financial modeling, but it's really, you just go and download

20:15.600 --> 20:21.000
a spreadsheet, fill a few values, change it to whatever you need, and that will provide

20:21.000 --> 20:25.640
you a lot of insight into the levers that actually move your business. So if, for example,

20:25.640 --> 20:31.040
you want to charge people $5 and you think you're going to be able to reach 2,000 customers,

20:31.040 --> 20:35.920
that means that you're going to make $10,000 a month. Maybe enough for you, maybe not enough

20:35.920 --> 20:39.440
to sustain a business, but now you know, maybe you need to increase the price, or maybe you

20:39.440 --> 20:43.840
need to have a different business model. So really, just the process of planning is extremely

20:43.840 --> 20:47.080
valuable. Now that you know the plan, you kind of know

20:47.080 --> 20:52.240
how you're going to make money, it's very important to assess the business opportunity.

20:52.240 --> 20:57.000
One common wrong way to do it is to say, well, you know, the software industry is vast. It's

20:57.000 --> 21:01.440
$1 trillion. If we do really well, Microsoft has 5% of it. If we do really well, we can

21:01.440 --> 21:06.880
go to 1%, and that's a lot of money. Realistically, that just doesn't make sense, and there's like

21:06.880 --> 21:12.200
so many variables that are hidden here that, you know, it just doesn't add any insights.

21:12.200 --> 21:17.240
Like the much better way to do it is bottoms up analysis. So it's essentially you saying,

21:17.240 --> 21:21.040
well, you know, we make $5 out of each customer. I think we can get to a million customers

21:21.040 --> 21:26.240
next year, and then 5 million 5 years after, and then 100 million 10 years after. And you

21:26.240 --> 21:28.520
probably not going to hit 100 million, or probably you're going to change some stuff

21:28.520 --> 21:33.720
in the business, that's fine. But just understanding that where you're heading is a $500 million

21:33.720 --> 21:37.560
a year business, that already gives you enough of context, and like gives you investors enough

21:37.560 --> 21:42.000
context to know what it is, you know, what kind of business you have.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.360
It's also important to ask, are you really selling $2 for $1? Like is your business model

21:47.360 --> 21:51.760
is like a losing model? So those are a bit more advanced questions. It's better to just

21:51.760 --> 21:56.200
do the market sizing in the beginning, but that's just something to keep in mind. And

21:56.200 --> 22:00.200
when asked here from Cal.com, like it's the open source calendar, I don't know if you

22:00.200 --> 22:05.200
know this one, and his top advice, he said that as an open source startup, you actually

22:05.200 --> 22:10.680
need a 10x time. Time is total addressable market. So like the, what I said in 10 years,

22:10.680 --> 22:15.760
100 million. And what he was saying by that is, you know, you're cannibalizing your own

22:15.760 --> 22:19.880
business. If you have a successful open source project, people are going to self-host it.

22:19.880 --> 22:24.760
At least I hope. And that means that you're competing with, you know, the most formidable

22:24.760 --> 22:29.040
competitor. They're always going to be at least as good as you are. And you're going

22:29.040 --> 22:32.320
to lose, right? So you have to understand that some people are not going to buy the,

22:32.320 --> 22:36.520
you know, the extra paid product. And that's important to keep in mind.

22:36.520 --> 22:42.560
I asked Nick from QuestDB, like his perspective, and for them, their delay in monetization,

22:42.560 --> 22:45.760
actually not charging money. And that I know, like the reason why I wanted to highlight

22:45.760 --> 22:49.760
this one, is that that's often a point of really cool about startups, like, oh, you

22:49.760 --> 22:53.440
know, this startup is losing like $10 million a year. But what you have to understand is

22:53.440 --> 22:56.360
that there are two kinds of losses. There are the losses that don't make sense, and you're

22:56.360 --> 23:00.960
just burning money for no good reason. And then the losses that are part of a strategy,

23:00.960 --> 23:05.320
like Nick's, which is saying, you know, we're only valuable if we actually have an ecosystem

23:05.320 --> 23:09.960
around us. We're only valuable if people actually use the product. And after that, we can figure

23:09.960 --> 23:13.600
out ways to make money. Or we already know how we're going to make money, but we can

23:13.600 --> 23:19.480
defer that. Okay. Now we can talk about go-to-market.

23:19.480 --> 23:23.360
Again, fancy way of saying getting customers. You know, you have to remember that at the

23:23.360 --> 23:26.880
end of the day, you're a business, and you need to make money. And paying customers are

23:26.880 --> 23:32.800
your business. Again, you can start by non-paying in the beginning, but you need customers.

23:32.800 --> 23:37.680
One common way of thinking about it is if you build it, they will come. It worked in

23:37.680 --> 23:41.640
the past, but it probably not going to work for you. You know, it worked for Linux, because

23:41.640 --> 23:46.880
that was the first open-source operating system. It worked for KDE. It worked for a lot of

23:46.880 --> 23:51.400
Linux distributions. But realistically for you, you're going to have a lot of competition,

23:51.400 --> 23:55.680
and people are most likely, like the market is most likely very saturated. So people are

23:55.680 --> 24:02.080
not just going to show up. So what you can do, though, is do things that

24:02.080 --> 24:08.120
don't scale. Again, as we said earlier, what does that mean? You know people. Ask, you

24:08.120 --> 24:15.040
know, email 200 people from your contact list to try your product. Or you're here at FOSDM.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.960
Just go to a relevant area or relevant dev room and just chat to people and just ask

24:18.960 --> 24:22.320
them to try your product. There are a lot of easy ways that are definitely not going

24:22.320 --> 24:25.960
to work. That's not how you're going to get to 100 million customers, but that's how you're

24:25.960 --> 24:29.840
going to get to your first stand. And you want to focus on the easy ones, like trying

24:29.840 --> 24:32.960
to sell to Amazon sounds like a very, you know, like, oh my god, they're going to pay

24:32.960 --> 24:37.560
me $10 million a year. That's amazing. But realistically, it's going to take six months

24:37.560 --> 24:42.000
until you get anywhere, and then it's going to fail. But even if it doesn't fail, then

24:42.000 --> 24:44.800
you succeed. It took you a year, and you're probably out of business by the time you even

24:44.800 --> 24:50.040
like managed to scratch the surface on that deal. And again, few that love you are much

24:50.040 --> 24:58.480
better than many who like. Go-to-market is a very common topic with both technical and

24:58.480 --> 25:03.520
open-source developers. The reason why is because we're technical. We don't think about marketing.

25:03.520 --> 25:07.360
We don't think about sales. We don't think about those things. And so a lot of people

25:07.360 --> 25:13.120
had a lot of feedback about that. One, ship as early as possible. Another one, learn marketing.

25:13.120 --> 25:17.560
Another one, you know, if you're trying to sell to companies, maybe start by getting

25:17.560 --> 25:21.040
the individuals at home first, because that's much easier than getting the approval and

25:21.040 --> 25:26.560
the contract and all of that going on. Now that you're kind of like, you're starting

25:26.560 --> 25:31.720
to get customers, you know, there's some traction, you actually have to, you know, have some

25:31.720 --> 25:36.160
metrics. And by metrics, I don't mean Google Analytics and like tracking your customers.

25:36.160 --> 25:42.760
I really just mean like knowing our things are even going the right way. And so, and

25:42.760 --> 25:45.720
also actually like if you know, if you're tracking the important things, you can also

25:45.720 --> 25:49.440
affect them. You can like, oh, revenue is not growing as much as we wanted. I guess we

25:49.440 --> 25:54.320
can, you know, do something about it. And so you really want to track the most important

25:54.320 --> 25:59.840
parts of the business. Often revenue, but you know, some precursor to revenue can be,

25:59.840 --> 26:04.640
you know, can be a good one as well. And it's really easy to go for vanity metrics. Like

26:04.640 --> 26:08.000
one of the founders, I'm not going to put, I didn't put a quote from him, but he said

26:08.000 --> 26:12.880
that they were tracking PyPy downloads. So like the Python package manager. That sounds

26:12.880 --> 26:16.960
great. The problem is, again, like CI, all of those kind of bots, all of those things

26:16.960 --> 26:20.040
actually download packages from there as well. And they thought they had a lot of traction

26:20.040 --> 26:25.280
but actually had nothing. So that's something to keep in mind. So there's some good metrics

26:25.280 --> 26:30.640
that you can use. You know, revenue is always king. If you're making money, great. But also

26:30.640 --> 26:35.080
a number of customers using you in production. So a few big companies that everyone knows

26:35.080 --> 26:39.960
are already using you to, you know, to serve millions of customers. That's something. Even

26:39.960 --> 26:44.800
if you're not making money now, you can probably make money later. Some insufficient ones are

26:44.800 --> 26:49.240
GitHub stars, signups, downloads, Twitter followers. You know, a GitHub star is really

26:49.240 --> 26:56.360
just someone clicked a button. Maybe that someone is a target customer, maybe not. Signups,

26:56.360 --> 26:58.920
maybe they signed up and then they dropped because they realized it's not even the product

26:58.920 --> 27:03.640
that they want. They're like a lot of really false signals here. And also, GitHub stars

27:03.640 --> 27:08.080
don't mean that you have a great business. So this one has like 240,000 stars, like one

27:08.080 --> 27:12.560
of the top star repos. But it's a set of tutorials. And maybe it's a great business. I don't know.

27:12.560 --> 27:20.240
They can spin it into something. But it's definitely not a business on its face value.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.680
But a lot of stars can definitely indicate that you're onto something. Again, this is

27:23.680 --> 27:29.040
from Superbase. They're at 40,000 stars and they're just growing like crazy every year

27:29.040 --> 27:36.240
consistently for two years, I guess. That's something. And that's just like an indication

27:36.240 --> 27:41.880
of the market share that they're gaining with the developers. So I guess the main question

27:41.880 --> 27:45.440
that we need to ask is whether we should even open source. I talked about all of that. And

27:45.440 --> 27:49.360
before you boom me off stage, I know this is not the right place to ask this question.

27:49.360 --> 27:53.280
But you have to understand it's actually a business decision. At the end of the day,

27:53.280 --> 27:58.000
you took money from investors. You promised them to return them more money. You got people

27:58.000 --> 28:00.840
on board, offered them a job and told them that you're going to be around for five years.

28:00.840 --> 28:06.640
So you have to make the best decision for your business. And there are reasons for both

28:06.640 --> 28:12.560
doing it and not doing it. And so one thing is your customers even care. Maybe they don't

28:12.560 --> 28:17.280
even know what open source is. I don't even know. I don't want to go with some cliche,

28:17.280 --> 28:21.520
but they just have no idea what open source is and they couldn't care less. Is there a

28:21.520 --> 28:25.840
business advantage to be in open source? So for example, when you're a developer tool,

28:25.840 --> 28:32.040
that means that people can try your product more easily. That's great. Maybe go open source.

28:32.040 --> 28:36.880
And does it even make businesses? You're just going to cut yourself. You're going to just

28:36.880 --> 28:42.600
kill your own business. So ideology is fine. I've done it for ideology as well with Etisink.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.760
It started as an open source project. But you just have to remember that at the end of

28:45.760 --> 28:52.320
the day, you're building a business. So they're definitely upsides. Engaged community really

28:52.320 --> 28:57.000
helps. Again, so many volunteers outside handing out flyers about projects, really promoting

28:57.000 --> 29:01.680
them. And you can also hire from the community. No need to find great developers if you already

29:01.680 --> 29:06.360
have developers that know your code base and been contributing code. Increase trust. Healthy

29:06.360 --> 29:11.840
communication that comes with open source. Easier adoption, as I said, with DevTools.

29:11.840 --> 29:16.440
And also the product is just more flexible. People can just fork it and adjust it to whatever

29:16.440 --> 29:22.680
they need. They're also downsides though. Balance the community and business needs.

29:22.680 --> 29:29.440
Does this one go to the open source product or does this stay as a priority extension?

29:29.440 --> 29:32.960
Getting a burnout is a good topic. It's a very front of mind topic for a lot of people

29:32.960 --> 29:37.120
nowadays and it's absolutely true. And the same with support, right? I mean, people asking

29:37.120 --> 29:41.080
questions about your product on GitHub, you want to make sure you're going to give them

29:41.080 --> 29:43.920
the best support possible. But they're not paying you in the end. So you're doing a lot

29:43.920 --> 29:48.440
of free support, which is fine. It's part of being a project, but also it can be overwhelming

29:48.440 --> 29:53.720
at times. It's really harder to say no to things because everything is in the open.

29:53.720 --> 29:58.960
And also startups win on speed. You really have to compete and move fast. And enabling

29:58.960 --> 30:02.320
self-hosting and doing database migration, seamless migration, all of those kind of things

30:02.320 --> 30:06.520
just makes things so much harder. And maintaining two core bases, which you have to do because

30:06.520 --> 30:11.040
you're going to have customizations for specific customers or you're going to have hacks for

30:11.040 --> 30:14.360
specific customers. You're going to have a ticketing system where you're going to say,

30:14.360 --> 30:18.680
well, you know, customer X asks for this. We have to finish it now. You're not going

30:18.680 --> 30:23.200
to be able to do that in the open just because your customers wouldn't want that. And also

30:23.200 --> 30:27.840
your secret sauce may be public. And you're really just undercutting yourself on price.

30:27.840 --> 30:34.560
You're looking to self-host. So there are downsides. Another quote that I like is by

30:34.560 --> 30:40.360
Joseph Jax. He said don't open source something you don't want to commoditize because you're

30:40.360 --> 30:44.080
open sourcing your secret sauce. You're open sourcing all of the internal structure. It's

30:44.080 --> 30:49.000
actually really easy to mimic or even fork, but definitely to mimic what you're building.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.920
So just assume it's a commodity the moment you release it and make sure that the stuff

30:51.920 --> 30:58.040
that you don't want to be a commodity, they stay proprietary. Okay. So now we can talk

30:58.040 --> 31:02.880
about fundraising. I know this is something that people are often mystified by even just

31:02.880 --> 31:07.440
by the amount of people that asked me about it in the last 48 hours alone. So happy to

31:07.440 --> 31:14.480
cover a bit of it. So the first thing is that you're dealing with investors. And when you're

31:14.480 --> 31:17.560
dealing with people, you have to understand what do they actually care about and understand

31:17.560 --> 31:23.680
how they think. So the first thing to understand is the power law venture capital investments.

31:23.680 --> 31:31.080
What does that mean? Let's assume for simplicity that a fund invests in 100 companies. Most

31:31.080 --> 31:35.320
startups fail. So that means 90 are going to fail. And they invest a million in each.

31:35.320 --> 31:39.600
So 90 are going to fail. Okay. They already lost $90 million. And now they have 10 live

31:39.600 --> 31:45.360
companies. Let's say five of them are going to return, sorry, eight of them are going

31:45.360 --> 31:50.040
to return 5X. Okay. That's a good outcome. They invested for a certain amount of money.

31:50.040 --> 31:55.120
It's now worth 5X that amount. Great return. So that's $40 million that they made. And

31:55.120 --> 32:01.640
then the last two, so they lost 90. They just made 40. So they're down 50. So the last two,

32:01.640 --> 32:05.440
the last two companies really need to carry the whole weight of the whole investment fund

32:05.440 --> 32:10.440
to actually make a return. So that means the last two probably need to return 100X each.

32:10.440 --> 32:14.520
So if they invested a value of 10 million, it needs to be worth a billion now. And it's

32:14.520 --> 32:18.960
really the old venture model is based on the fact they're trying to find these one or two

32:18.960 --> 32:24.360
companies in their whole fund that is going to be 100X. Facebook was a 2000X or something

32:24.360 --> 32:29.440
like that. Uber as well. They're companies that are definitely outliers. Apple as well

32:29.440 --> 32:36.520
if you look at the whole 30 years at a time. So the moment to understand that they don't

32:36.520 --> 32:43.280
care about your 5X, because that 5X was $40 million out of the 240 that they made, you

32:43.280 --> 32:49.880
really have to position yourself as that 100X. And you also have to understand that they

32:49.880 --> 32:54.240
have investors. So even though you're talking to that person and they love what you're doing

32:54.240 --> 32:59.080
and they're open source developers themselves, they really want the product, whatever, they

32:59.080 --> 33:02.320
have investors to answer for. They told them, hey, I'm going to invest your money and I'm

33:02.320 --> 33:07.880
going to give you that amount of return. So really, you have to make sure to understand

33:07.880 --> 33:13.680
that dynamic. It's also, it's their job. I mean, here I wrote, you know, stay in touch,

33:13.680 --> 33:17.400
but really it's their job to waste your time. And they want to like meet you. They want

33:17.400 --> 33:20.360
to like know more about the space because they're going to invest in a competitor and

33:20.360 --> 33:23.800
they really want to understand the space better. They want to know about all the cool companies

33:23.800 --> 33:27.120
so they can tell their friends at the country club that, I mean, that was maybe a bit of

33:27.120 --> 33:30.880
an extreme joke, but they want to tell their friends that they've talked to all of these

33:30.880 --> 33:34.920
cool companies that are just doing very well now. This is not your job. Your job is to

33:34.920 --> 33:40.200
build a company, not to waste your time talking to investors. And another thing to remember

33:40.200 --> 33:47.160
is that not a yes is a no. So investors want to invest in the really good companies. As

33:47.160 --> 33:51.440
I said, they want to invest in the hundred extra. It's really hard to know if this company

33:51.440 --> 33:54.760
is that. So what they're going to say, they're not going to say, well, no, this is stupid.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.240
I'm not going to invest in you. What they're going to say is like, oh my God, this sounds

33:57.240 --> 34:01.020
amazing. I need to build my conviction for a few weeks and I'm going to like do some

34:01.020 --> 34:04.200
research and I'm going to like talk to you then and then they disappear. But if they

34:04.200 --> 34:08.320
see that some big name investor is talking to you or there's some traction there, then

34:08.320 --> 34:12.880
they're going to come back and complain to you and say, well, I told you I was interested.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.360
But really what they said in the beginning was no and you're never going to hear back

34:15.360 --> 34:18.440
from them again. So it's really important to count that as a no and not to count that

34:18.440 --> 34:25.440
as a yes. And another thing is that you want to believe the no, but not the why. So again,

34:25.440 --> 34:29.320
they want to invest in you, maybe not even in this company, but maybe in your next company,

34:29.320 --> 34:36.800
but they want to invest in the best companies. And if they're going to tell you, you suck,

34:36.800 --> 34:41.280
you're not going to talk to them the next time. So they're really going to say something

34:41.280 --> 34:44.960
nice like, oh, you know, this is, you know, our fund is like slowing down its investment

34:44.960 --> 34:48.560
so that really this is not the right time for us. But like, let's chat again in a couple

34:48.560 --> 34:52.480
of months. Really what they mean by that is leave me alone. I don't want to invest.

34:52.480 --> 34:56.680
And so like don't like, don't count it as a yes in a couple of months. Just count it

34:56.680 --> 35:02.440
as a no, essentially. Also like everything, it's a business. You want to have a plan.

35:02.440 --> 35:05.880
How much are you going to raise? What are you going to actually do with the money? Like,

35:05.880 --> 35:09.680
you know, it sounds good. I'm going to raise $2 million, but are you going to hire people?

35:09.680 --> 35:13.200
What are those people going to achieve? You know, figure those things out. How much of

35:13.200 --> 35:17.200
the money are you willing to sell? Are you willing to sell 90% of the company for $1

35:17.200 --> 35:20.940
million? Are you willing to send 10? Those are all questions that you have to come in

35:20.940 --> 35:24.720
prepared for because you're dealing with professional negotiators that are going to rip you to

35:24.720 --> 35:29.720
shreds if you don't have like a strong stance on any of those. Another thing is to speak

35:29.720 --> 35:36.880
to investors all at once. So investors talk, as I mentioned, and they will talk about the

35:36.880 --> 35:41.400
cool companies that are chatting with. And if they're going to see that you've been talking

35:41.400 --> 35:45.800
to investors for the last year and you haven't raised around yet, that probably means you're

35:45.800 --> 35:51.080
tainted goods and they're not going to want to invest in you as well. So the right thing

35:51.080 --> 35:54.800
to do is probably try to invest money, like raise capital for like two, three months,

35:54.800 --> 35:58.880
and after that, if that doesn't work out, just stop, go back to building your business.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.360
If you're a developer, you probably don't need that money anyway. You can just continue

36:01.360 --> 36:08.920
building the product and then come back stronger in a few months. I'm going to rush this one

36:08.920 --> 36:13.600
a bit, but if you want to find investors, start with angels. Don't chase Sequoia. They're

36:13.600 --> 36:18.400
not going to invest in a small company, or they very rarely do. Don't waste your time.

36:18.400 --> 36:24.320
Build traction with angels, like small checks, and find people that are excited by the space,

36:24.320 --> 36:29.120
invested in similar companies, ask your friends. But really, the most important thing is don't

36:29.120 --> 36:33.760
take intros from investors who haven't invested. Investors want to look good, and again, they

36:33.760 --> 36:36.640
want to look like they know all the companies. So they're going to tell you, hey, I'm going

36:36.640 --> 36:40.840
to introduce you. I know a guy, Sequoia. I'm going to introduce you to him. I know a girl.

36:40.840 --> 36:46.000
They're that fun. But really what happens is that if they haven't invested in you themselves,

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
they're just signals to Sequoia that you're tainted goods, because they don't want to

36:49.000 --> 36:53.600
invest in you, so why should they? So that's a really bad strategy to accept those intros.

36:53.600 --> 37:01.640
Just say that you already have enough traction and interest. But once they invest, by all

37:01.640 --> 37:06.000
means, that's the strongest signal. Someone put their money on you, have them introduce,

37:06.000 --> 37:09.400
have them go on a building and shout to the world that they've invested, and get introductions

37:09.400 --> 37:17.800
from them. This is actually where I see founders error the most, not because maybe that's the

37:17.800 --> 37:22.880
most common place for mistakes. It's just a place that I'm exposed to the most, is their

37:22.880 --> 37:27.680
decks and their pitch. You want to really keep it short. You want them asking for more,

37:27.680 --> 37:33.080
not going through 80 pages of boring stuff about whatever. You want to keep it short,

37:33.080 --> 37:38.720
short, 10, maybe 15 slides, really on point. You want to highlight what's most impressive,

37:38.720 --> 37:44.640
and in your case, it's probably team, maybe idea. Maybe if you have a really impressive

37:44.640 --> 37:48.320
set of customers, that's great. Highlight that. But most likely, you don't need to analyze

37:48.320 --> 37:52.840
your $2,000 a month revenue, because again, they don't care about that. It's not something

37:52.840 --> 37:58.000
that they see impressive. So focus on the stuff that are impressive.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.960
Another thing that people often get wrong is they confuse their customers with investors.

38:01.960 --> 38:06.040
So they go to the investor and assume the investor has the problem. The investor actually

38:06.040 --> 38:10.280
really cares about, I don't even know, I don't have an example at the top of my head, but

38:10.280 --> 38:14.480
they really care about this topic, and they understand the problem, and they face it themselves,

38:14.480 --> 38:19.960
and they really feel it. And if you told them about all the research that you've done, about

38:19.960 --> 38:24.120
this product, and how you solve it, they're going to really be interested about that.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.880
The most likely scenario is that they don't even know what you're talking about. It's

38:26.880 --> 38:31.200
not their job to be subject matter experts in whatever it is esoteric thing that you're

38:31.200 --> 38:35.600
building. They just need you to demonstrate that there is a problem. People really care

38:35.600 --> 38:39.160
about that. People are going to pay you money. This is how much money you're going to make.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.320
This is how you're solving it, not necessarily in this order. This is who you are and why

38:42.320 --> 38:47.960
you're the best person or best team to solve it.

38:47.960 --> 38:52.640
And obviously, you want to know your business inside out. You want to be concise, so let

38:52.640 --> 38:56.800
them ask questions, always iterate. Every after every call, I would go back and make

38:56.800 --> 39:04.840
sure that I get better after every call. On the call, be calm, relax, don't look desperate.

39:04.840 --> 39:08.920
You can sense desperation a mile away. When we were fundraising, I knew the worst case,

39:08.920 --> 39:12.400
I'm a developer, I can build a product myself. I don't need their money. I would love to

39:12.400 --> 39:18.120
have it, but I don't need it. That made it possible for me to relax and show that confidence

39:18.120 --> 39:23.040
that they're looking for. You're also assessing them. Ask questions, figure out if you want

39:23.040 --> 39:28.080
to take their money, because you're going to be with them for the long run if they're

39:28.080 --> 39:33.040
going to invest, so that's important. Also, only the CEO should go on calls. Don't

39:33.040 --> 39:37.840
do party conversations. First of all, just distraction, but also, you're going to get

39:37.840 --> 39:44.320
so many noses, and it's much better that less people get pounded with all of these noses,

39:44.320 --> 39:49.840
and the other people can actually focus on the business and continue.

39:49.840 --> 39:54.320
So the deal, this is mostly a side for you to read afterwards, but there are a lot of

39:54.320 --> 39:58.000
topics like, is it simple, is it fast, or are we going to spend 200,000 on lawyers in

39:58.000 --> 40:02.360
this deal? What are the terms for Rata, liquidation preference? All of those kind of things, you

40:02.360 --> 40:08.920
need to understand before you jump on that call, and make sure that what they're offering

40:08.920 --> 40:14.120
is what you're willing to accept. One thing that really grinds my gears, by the way, is

40:14.120 --> 40:20.120
investors that tell you, we invest 500,000. 50% of that is in money, and 50% of that is

40:20.120 --> 40:25.120
in services. So we're going to let you use our office and use our designers. I don't

40:25.120 --> 40:29.840
want your services. I'm going to hire my own designers, and that is such a rip-off if you

40:29.840 --> 40:36.520
ask me, and avoid those if you can. So final notes about fundraising. You only need one

40:36.520 --> 40:41.960
yes. When preparing this talk, I was thinking in my head, how many noses did I get when

40:41.960 --> 40:45.440
fundraising? I thought probably one, two. Then I looked at my notes, it was probably close

40:45.440 --> 40:50.480
to 50, but I really couldn't care less, because that doesn't matter. I only need one yes.

40:50.480 --> 40:53.120
You probably need more than one yes, you're probably going to get a few investors, but

40:53.120 --> 40:57.680
once you get a yes, the flywheel is rolling. Ignore the naysayers, ignore the assholes,

40:57.680 --> 41:01.640
you're going to meet some really shitty people along the way. They're humans as well, so

41:01.640 --> 41:06.680
just ignore those. Fundraising is definitely not success. Fundraising is definitely not

41:06.680 --> 41:10.680
company building. You need to actually build your company. This is not the end, this is

41:10.680 --> 41:16.480
just the beginning. You may not be able to raise some expectations, be ready for that,

41:16.480 --> 41:21.280
have a plan B, that's absolutely fine as well. As I said, very hard to fire investors, so

41:21.280 --> 41:26.480
watch out who you put in your cap table and who you marry. Another small point is that

41:26.480 --> 41:32.880
many investors only invest in certain locales, so a lot of investors only invest in the US.

41:32.880 --> 41:39.080
That's something to keep in mind. Why a big fan? They find a lot of open-source startups.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.440
They've been transformational for us. I would really consider applying. We got rejected

41:42.440 --> 41:47.600
many times. Don't let it hold you back. There are a lot of great open-source startups, GitLab,

41:47.600 --> 41:53.240
Docker, Superbase, HopeHosog, really the list just goes on and on. You're going to be in

41:53.240 --> 41:59.640
good company. One thing is that you need to be aware of the siren song. The tempting places

41:59.640 --> 42:04.600
where things usually go wrong for people. One place, as I said, fundraising or valuation

42:04.600 --> 42:08.960
or money raise or thinking that talking to an investor is actually success. But again,

42:08.960 --> 42:13.520
no, you need to build your company. Another area that people go wrong is that thinking

42:13.520 --> 42:17.840
that hiring more people is actually success. Managing 20 people. How big is your team?

42:17.840 --> 42:22.400
People ask me that all the time. We're small. The reason why we're small is because that's

42:22.400 --> 42:25.480
what we need to build a kick-ass product. This is something that you need to keep in

42:25.480 --> 42:31.120
mind. Burning money does not equate success. Plain startup does not build a company. Going

42:31.120 --> 42:35.560
to pitch competition, startup conferences, startup meetups, investor chats, all of those

42:35.560 --> 42:42.160
kind of things. Fun. Chasing press as well. Maybe fun. Honestly, probably fun. But it

42:42.160 --> 42:46.720
really just don't mean anything for the bottom line of your business. Just don't do it. Also

42:46.720 --> 42:50.840
remember, you really have not made it. Really don't look focused. The only thing that matters

42:50.840 --> 42:56.360
are customers, product, team and metrics. That's it. Everything else is just noise or

42:56.360 --> 43:03.160
maybe an enabler to get to everything else. So some lessons I personally learned the hard

43:03.160 --> 43:09.080
way is that you're no longer an engineer. I really like coding. That's it. I wake up,

43:09.080 --> 43:14.080
I love coding. And it's really hard to remember that this is not why you raise capital. Like

43:14.080 --> 43:19.160
this is not what my job is at the business anymore. I'm the CEO. I need to do just business

43:19.160 --> 43:24.760
stuff. I can help with the code. I can help with the architecture. But my main time should

43:24.760 --> 43:30.320
be spent on go-to-market. Opportunities are not going to last forever. Just grab them

43:30.320 --> 43:33.880
when you see them. It's very easy to say, I'm just going to perfect this landing page

43:33.880 --> 43:37.760
for a couple more weeks and then I'm going to take this opportunity. But then the opportunity

43:37.760 --> 43:43.000
is going to be gone. We missed a few in the beginning. People are going to be trying to

43:43.000 --> 43:49.360
take advantage of you. So just watch out. You're running a large budget. So just watch

43:49.360 --> 43:55.840
out for those people. Be mindful and protective of your time. So a lot of people are going

43:55.840 --> 43:59.840
to want to chat, catch up, whatever. Great. But as I said, you're going to be working

43:59.840 --> 44:07.240
24 hours. So maybe spare the 25th hour for some fun stuff or maybe more work. And the

44:07.240 --> 44:11.240
last thing is that you really want to surround yourself with optimists. The truth is that

44:11.240 --> 44:15.120
your startup sucks. And it's going to suck for the longest time. So the last thing you

44:15.120 --> 44:21.720
want is people that are negative around you. A few more things. Team, super important.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.920
Early team sets the tone. Bad hires can really derail the company. Great co-founders can

44:25.920 --> 44:29.640
make the difference. I've seen it multiple times. But actually better to start on your

44:29.640 --> 44:35.360
own than having a terrible co-founder, which I've also had. You're really in control of

44:35.360 --> 44:39.440
your destiny. If something isn't working, you can change it. The only thing you cannot

44:39.440 --> 44:43.560
change is the market. But really just iterate, iterate, iterate. You can get lucky. We got

44:43.560 --> 44:47.760
lucky many times. Just put yourself out there. Talk to customers and you're going to notice

44:47.760 --> 44:51.080
something that no one else has and you're going to get lucky. And it's really a game

44:51.080 --> 44:54.600
of persistence. You can't lose unless you stop. Obviously I'm not saying go and bang

44:54.600 --> 45:00.040
your hand against the wall. You have to have some, you know, some acumen there. But as

45:00.040 --> 45:05.400
long as you don't give up, you're going to win. So just a few closing advice. It's very

45:05.400 --> 45:10.760
easy to think that hiring X will fix everything. Or customer X, once we get them, that's it.

45:10.760 --> 45:14.760
The business is going to go crazy. Or maybe this investor is going to change the destiny

45:14.760 --> 45:19.200
of the company. And maybe. Maybe some of them will. But it's really just on to you to actually

45:19.200 --> 45:23.760
fix the company and make it work. And you have to remember everything is sales. So you

45:23.760 --> 45:26.680
have to really get good at it. You want to get customers. You're going to get candidates.

45:26.680 --> 45:29.280
You're going to get investors. You have to sell them on the vision of the company and

45:29.280 --> 45:36.040
the company itself. Some more sources of great advice. YC YouTube channel, library. I mean,

45:36.040 --> 45:40.920
check it out afterwards in the slides. And yeah. And that's it. I just want to give you

45:40.920 --> 45:46.800
like a few closing words before I open the floor for questions. So make sure that it's

45:46.800 --> 45:51.360
really what you want. I mean, I kind of like try to dissuade you a bit in the beginning

45:51.360 --> 45:55.440
because really you need to be, you need to want to start this company even with my dissuasion

45:55.440 --> 46:00.440
there. And the only important things are to talk to your customers and build a product.

46:00.440 --> 46:03.920
Nothing else matters at this stage. You want to build something that people love. You have

46:03.920 --> 46:08.920
to remember it's a business. It's not, you know, not an open source project. It's something

46:08.920 --> 46:13.800
that you have to actually make money. And this is the primer, but there's so much more

46:13.800 --> 46:17.560
to it. And this is just to get you from zero to one. Every stage of the company is different

46:17.560 --> 46:21.400
and there's so much more and like, and maybe conflicting advice once you get to the one

46:21.400 --> 46:27.440
and once you get to the two. And one more thing. It's your job to be the number one

46:27.440 --> 46:33.200
evangelist of the company. And so always be selling. And in that spirit, if you need webhooks

46:33.200 --> 46:39.120
or you want to work at a fast growing startup, yeah, come talk to me about Sviks. And that's

46:39.120 --> 46:40.120
it. Any questions?

46:40.120 --> 46:47.120
Yeah. Sorry, a bit over.

46:47.120 --> 46:54.120
Amazing talk. Thanks a lot.
