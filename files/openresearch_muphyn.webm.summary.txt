The speaker presents Muffin, a software tool for modeling and simulating multi-physics systems. The project is a collaboration between CERF Technique and Thales-Alenia Space, funded by a public fund in Belgium. Muffin converts physical systems into electrical analogues for simulation, using an adaptive model reduction to optimize simulation accuracy and speed. The software is entirely written in Python and includes a graphical tool for building simulation models, default process boxes, custom process box and simulation solvers, and an IPython interaction. Muffin is available on PyP for installation. Future plans for Muffin include improving user interactivity and scheduling.
