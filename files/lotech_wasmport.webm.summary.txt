The talk discusses Wollmux, a Java extension to LibreOffice for template and form management and mail merge. The project was started by the city of Munich in 2005-2006 under the Linux project umbrella to migrate to open office because they wanted some template management and there was nothing powerful enough. The extension has moved to CDF and has undergone adaptations and adjustments to fit an international open source project like LibreOffice. The talk ends with next steps and possible future plans for the project, including some renaming for the Java packages, new landing page, bug fixes, and a release. The talk also invites contributors to join the project and help with comment translation, UI and document translation, or implementing cool feature ideas.
