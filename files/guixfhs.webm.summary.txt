The speaker begins by introducing GNU Geeks, a distribution of the GNU operating system that follows the Free System Distribution Guidelines and is built on Guile Scheme. They explain that Geeks does not follow the File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS) in order to have different package versions for different users and to easily configure the system. The speaker then introduces GeekShell, a tool that allows users to install and use packages in a temporary environment without polluting their main system. They explain that GeekShell is fast because it caches the packages and it is declarative, reproducible, and allows for system configuration. Focusing on the FHS option in GeekShell, the speaker demonstrates how it allows users to create FHS-like environments within containers. They provide several examples including running the Tor browser, setting up Rust tooling, and running Electron-based applications like VSCodium. The speaker also shares some tips and concludes by expressing the need for utilities to make using FHS containers easier.
