00:00.000 --> 00:14.120
Hello, everybody. Welcome back. Our next talk is from Fraser Tudel, Fraser Tweedow. He lives

00:14.120 --> 00:19.640
in Brisbane, Australia, where he works in identity management in PKI at Red Hat. He's

00:19.640 --> 00:22.800
passionate about functional programming and security and really likes playing with little

00:22.800 --> 00:27.000
plastic bricks from Denmark, a detail which he clearly included to pander to his co-organizer

00:27.000 --> 00:42.160
tools. Okay. So, just a very quick talk, giving an update about the Haskell Security Advisory

00:42.160 --> 00:52.520
Database. So, why do we want one? Well, security matters a lot. It is very important. And many

00:52.520 --> 00:58.960
programming languages have been improving their security tooling and introducing vulnerability

00:58.960 --> 01:05.760
databases of their own, audit tools in the package management and build systems. And

01:05.760 --> 01:11.280
so we should follow suit. We should not just follow, we should try and lead, in fact, and

01:11.280 --> 01:18.560
have best-in-class security tooling for our best-in-class language. It's increasingly

01:18.560 --> 01:25.040
important for industry adoption that language ecosystems have a way of reporting security

01:25.040 --> 01:31.720
vulnerabilities and disseminating that information, so that commercial users of the language or

01:31.720 --> 01:38.240
non-commercial users of the language can find out about security issues when they arise

01:38.240 --> 01:47.840
and respond to them. It's also needed for some industry certifications like ISO 27001,

01:47.840 --> 01:58.520
which is therefore also important for industry adoption. So, in August 2022, there was a

01:58.520 --> 02:07.480
tech proposal through the Haskell Foundation Tech Proposal Procedures to establish a security

02:07.480 --> 02:16.720
advisory database and a team who would manage it. And that proposal was refined and accepted.

02:16.720 --> 02:24.880
The database repository was created, bootstrapped, if you will, in November 2022, but as of now

02:24.880 --> 02:32.720
it's still empty. So the next step is to assemble a security response team who will populate

02:32.720 --> 02:39.360
and manage that database. And the call for nominations for the Haskell security response

02:39.360 --> 02:48.040
team will be going out in the next couple of days. The responsibilities of the security

02:48.040 --> 02:57.480
response team or SRT will be to triage and assess incoming security reports and for real

02:57.480 --> 03:05.480
vulnerabilities to move them into the database. So we will update and maintain the advisory

03:05.480 --> 03:12.480
database and ensure that the data is in a form that is useful for downstream security

03:12.480 --> 03:18.600
tooling. So these could be tools like Cabal Install. We can implement an audit command

03:18.600 --> 03:25.960
to check whether your program or any of its dependencies have known security vulnerabilities.

03:25.960 --> 03:32.040
GitHub Dependabot is another tool on GitHub that can consume the data in the advisory

03:32.040 --> 03:39.440
database and automatically notify maintainers and project owners when there are security

03:39.440 --> 03:46.600
issues and potentially even do bumping of bounds and automatically creating pull requests

03:46.600 --> 03:54.600
and testing the projects in order to make life easier for maintainers to move when a

03:54.600 --> 04:00.840
security issue is found. So developing those tools is not the responsibility

04:00.840 --> 04:06.680
of the SRT, but working with and liaising with the developers of those downstream tools

04:06.680 --> 04:14.360
is a responsibility. And there will be a quarterly report on the team's activities and on the

04:14.360 --> 04:26.120
trends in the reported security issues. So who will be on the SRT? We're looking for

04:26.120 --> 04:32.800
five volunteers who can commit to an initial term of six or 12 months. And in that way

04:32.800 --> 04:39.960
the terms will then be staggered. We're looking for people with experience in security topics

04:39.960 --> 04:47.360
such as this is not an exhaustive list, but topics like secure development and web application

04:47.360 --> 04:55.880
security, pen testing, incident response and vulnerability research, cryptography, authentication,

04:55.880 --> 05:02.720
security management, GRC, that's governance risk and compliance and any other security

05:02.720 --> 05:08.960
related topics. Obviously no one has all of these, but we're looking for people to bring

05:08.960 --> 05:15.320
different experience in these different topic areas so that we have a broad coverage within

05:15.320 --> 05:22.040
the security response team. So as I mentioned the call for nominations will go out in the

05:22.040 --> 05:26.440
next day or so. We're looking for people to self nominate, so if you know someone who

05:26.440 --> 05:31.920
you think would be great, please encourage them to nominate themselves. The nomination

05:31.920 --> 05:40.440
process will be to email me on that address and say I want to do it and give a brief overview

05:40.440 --> 05:48.200
of your background in security. And we will aim to announce the initial security response

05:48.200 --> 05:54.240
team around the end of February. And that's the update. Thanks for listening.
