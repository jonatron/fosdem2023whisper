In this talk at the FOSDEM conference, Mikhail discusses his research on using Genode as a framework for operating system (OS) development. He highlights the challenges faced by OS researchers, such as non-free licensing, hardware black boxes, and missing documentation. Mikhail argues that Linux is not an optimal choice for OS research due to its complex codebase and compatibility constraints. Instead, he proposes Genode as a minimal and extensible OS framework that can lower the development burden and facilitate research. He shares his own research project, ELAN OS, which is based on Genode and demonstrates its advantages in terms of reduced development time and code complexity. He also discusses the use of Genode's internal scenario concept to automate experiments, using a database benchmark as an example. Finally, Mikhail outlines his future plans for ELAN OS and his intention to contribute to Genode by adding NUMA support and profiling tools.
