00:00.000 --> 00:18.120
So, hello and welcome to FOSDEM 2023 and I hope everyone is awake and looking forward

00:18.120 --> 00:23.640
to two days packed with lots of talks, at least I am.

00:23.640 --> 00:33.120
And we, that's Christy, Thorsten and me, we are the organizers or deaf room managers

00:33.120 --> 00:39.640
for this room, so if you have any questions, you can approach us, we are here to guide

00:39.640 --> 00:45.920
through the day and we are also the ones who submitted the idea of the sovereign cloud

00:45.920 --> 00:54.880
deaf room to the FOSDEM and we did that because, well, with our day work, we actually work

00:54.880 --> 01:02.280
in that space, so Thorsten is from the Operate First project by Red Hat, I work on the sovereign

01:02.280 --> 01:09.440
cloud stack, which is also a project that is centered with a focus on sovereign cloud

01:09.440 --> 01:16.440
infrastructure and standards and of course, as we work with that on a day to day base,

01:16.440 --> 01:24.080
we think it's an important topic and also the term sovereignty, digital sovereignty

01:24.080 --> 01:31.400
is often a term that is used a lot lately and it actually needs proper definition and

01:31.400 --> 01:36.560
it also, there needs to be a discussion about it, what it actually means and what is needed

01:36.560 --> 01:43.280
in order to work towards sovereign infrastructure and that, if you look at the talks that are

01:43.280 --> 01:52.520
happening today in this room, that will be discussed a lot and, yeah, I don't really

01:52.520 --> 01:58.040
have much more to add to that, Thorsten, do you want to?

01:58.040 --> 02:03.360
Again, yeah, so I'm working with Red Hat and I'm in the Project Operate First, which

02:03.360 --> 02:09.120
is the idea of open operations, you can see the stickers here and if you want to pick

02:09.120 --> 02:18.160
them up, the idea there is that we offer more or less free service by where you can open

02:18.160 --> 02:25.440
up your own Kubernetes clusters, you can deploy your project there and you have also a kind

02:25.440 --> 02:31.080
of open SRE there because you can see the different infrastructure data and so that's

02:31.080 --> 02:37.120
the basic idea of open operations and with open operations, you get the chance to be

02:37.120 --> 02:41.400
sovereign with your data because it's easy to move, it's easy to see and we are totally

02:41.400 --> 02:45.480
hybrid so it doesn't matter if it's on your own premise or in whatever cloud or you're

02:45.480 --> 02:51.120
switching in between, so Operate First is kind of the idea, one of the proof of concept

02:51.120 --> 02:56.200
that the idea of sovereign cloud can work in a practical idea.

02:56.200 --> 03:04.080
Hi, I'm Kristin Nicola, I'm a software engineer with Boston University, I work on the MOC

03:04.080 --> 03:10.280
Alliance project out of Boston University whose goal is to create an open cloud for

03:10.280 --> 03:16.440
academia but not only, I also work on OpenStack, I am on the OpenStack Technical Committee

03:16.440 --> 03:22.880
and I am a maintainer of the OpenStack Keystone project which is for identity management,

03:22.880 --> 03:29.960
I also work on varying degrees on Operate First with Thorstein on Open Infra Labs and

03:29.960 --> 03:37.040
on various acronym rich things like NERC, Nessie, etc.

03:37.040 --> 03:46.320
And working on open source and having worked on deploying and maintaining open clouds,

03:46.320 --> 03:51.760
the topic of sovereign clouds is very important to me and I see it as the next step in not

03:51.760 --> 03:56.320
just opening up the telemetry and how you're deploying it and how you're running it but

03:56.320 --> 04:02.720
also opening up the governance and all of those other aspects to actually create a place

04:02.720 --> 04:08.800
where everyone can contribute to on all aspects of the cloud and not just take what you're

04:08.800 --> 04:15.320
doing and apply it to a different degree.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.720
So with that I, Boston already had the first highlight for me because I did not know that

04:19.720 --> 04:25.840
you are the PTL for Keystone so that's really useful for me to know because we just submitted

04:25.840 --> 04:34.600
patches to Keystone for federated authentication and so we should really talk a lot more.

04:34.600 --> 04:42.080
So with that the first one who will talk will be my colleague Max and he will prepare and

04:42.080 --> 04:47.960
then we will give a proper introduction to Max and start with that in 10 minutes, right?

04:47.960 --> 04:51.200
Yeah, in 10 minutes, right.

04:51.200 --> 04:57.440
And feel free, here's some candy, some chocolate, if you want to, there are stickers there and

04:57.440 --> 05:20.200
yeah enjoy the day, right?
