WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.880
Okay, now we have Charles Brozegard and he's going to speak to us of binary pattern matching

00:15.880 --> 00:20.200
in Elixir and Erlang, one of the cool features of Erlang and Elixir.

00:20.200 --> 00:26.040
So if you speak binary to me, give it up for Charles.

00:26.040 --> 00:35.440
Thank you, don't worry, I'm not going to speak binary, but yes, this is a talk about speaking

00:35.440 --> 00:37.800
binary to other devices.

00:37.800 --> 00:47.160
And this is me and you can find me around the web at ARTRARBR, yes.

00:47.160 --> 00:53.000
I work as a software developer in Denmark in a company called Indelab and part of my job

00:53.000 --> 00:57.560
is to work on innovations in the Internet of Things realm.

00:57.560 --> 01:03.280
So things like smart buildings, smart cities, and smart factories.

01:03.280 --> 01:08.440
In practice, this involves building gateways that link many different kinds of stupid things

01:08.440 --> 01:14.160
together and then when we have a network of things, they can exchange information and

01:14.160 --> 01:17.640
we can embed the smartest into the system.

01:17.640 --> 01:21.520
And by many different stupid things, I mean things like remote terminal units which are

01:21.520 --> 01:28.240
used in the grid, electric grid and all the utilities, PLCs which are used heavily in factories

01:28.240 --> 01:36.360
for automation, solar inverters, heat pumps, thermostats, all kinds of smart home equipment.

01:36.360 --> 01:41.840
And at the lowest level, we have simple sensors and actuators.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.640
And the thing that all these things have in common is that I had to speak binary to them.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.960
They don't speak JSON, they don't know XML, they don't know protocol even.

01:52.960 --> 02:00.960
They had their own custom binary dialects depending on the protocol that they are using.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.040
And later in this talk I show an example of a simple binary dialect so that we all know

02:06.040 --> 02:09.120
what it is.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.960
When I'm building an integration for a system like this, I always reach for Elixir first.

02:13.960 --> 02:18.160
This is because Elixir has some special affordances that makes it extremely good at this kind

02:18.160 --> 02:20.720
of work.

02:20.720 --> 02:27.160
This is also the case for Erlang and LFE and Beam and Gleam and the other languages on the

02:27.160 --> 02:32.040
Erlang virtual machine, but Elixir happens to be my happy space.

02:32.040 --> 02:37.080
Some of the Beam's known strong points in this area are fault tolerance, state machines

02:37.080 --> 02:39.440
and concurrency.

02:39.440 --> 02:43.920
And then there's business acts and that's what I'll be talking about today.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.360
This is a beginner level talk.

02:45.360 --> 02:50.720
I don't assume you know anything about Elixir or the previously mentioned systems, but my

02:50.720 --> 02:54.120
hope is that if you should find yourself in a situation where you need to speak binary

02:54.120 --> 02:59.240
to something, this talk will help you get started.

02:59.240 --> 03:02.600
So binaries.

03:02.600 --> 03:08.040
Computers today work by manipulating electric signals and a signal can be either a logic

03:08.040 --> 03:10.360
high or a logic low.

03:10.360 --> 03:15.600
Because a signal is known as a bit and a sequence of 8 bits is a byte.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.280
And this is also how computers communicate.

03:18.280 --> 03:23.560
No matter if it's Ethernet or Wi-Fi or whatever, it's about transferring a logic signal of

03:23.560 --> 03:27.760
high and low bits.

03:27.760 --> 03:34.160
There are different ways we can write down the binary signals.

03:34.160 --> 03:40.560
The first notation that I highlighted here is in binary where we just take every bit

03:40.560 --> 03:45.520
in the sequence and we write it down as a 0 or a 1.

03:45.520 --> 03:52.040
And then it prefix it with a 0B so that it's easier to tell from other numbers.

03:52.040 --> 03:59.720
And in this case, the sequence of 8 bits, which is a byte, can also be turned into a

03:59.720 --> 04:05.960
decimal number because in a byte we can have 256 different combinations.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.520
So it's a number from 0 to 255.

04:09.520 --> 04:16.960
And in decimal notation, this sequence of bits is 75.

04:16.960 --> 04:24.960
There's also Hex notation, where we use the characters 0 to 9 and 8 to F.

04:24.960 --> 04:31.120
This means we can describe the constant of a byte with just two characters.

04:31.120 --> 04:37.760
So this is very convenient when we are dealing with binary numbers.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.480
Just a common example of where we write the bytes as decimals.

04:41.480 --> 04:47.080
We do that with IPv4 addresses because an IPv4 address is just four bytes.

04:47.080 --> 04:54.000
But then for human consumption, we write it as a binary number, or sorry, a decimal number.

04:54.000 --> 05:05.360
And MAC addresses use Hex notation instead of the binary notation.

05:05.360 --> 05:11.440
While all the operations in our computers are processing bits and bytes, we rarely think

05:11.440 --> 05:14.120
about them when we are programming.

05:14.120 --> 05:21.280
We think in terms of integers, floats, strings, lists, maps, and all the structures.

05:21.280 --> 05:26.720
But binary data is just a flat stream of bits.

05:26.720 --> 05:33.080
There's nothing inherent in it to tell one field from the other, or any kind of structure.

05:33.080 --> 05:37.120
It's all down to how we interpret those bits.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.480
This means that when we need to speak binary to something from our programs, we need to

05:41.480 --> 05:47.600
write a translation layer that can take whatever list of maps we have in our program and turn

05:47.600 --> 05:52.840
it into a binary sequence.

05:52.840 --> 05:58.160
I prefer calling this translation layer a codec because it's short to write.

05:58.160 --> 06:04.360
And you can say that a codec encodes our data structures in bytes for sending.

06:04.360 --> 06:14.440
And then when we receive data, the codec decodes that data into our high-level data structures.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.440
And sometimes we're lucky we can find a library that will do that for us, but sometimes we

06:18.440 --> 06:20.360
need to do it ourselves.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.160
And that's where bit syntax comes in handy.

06:24.160 --> 06:29.080
So let's take a look at that.

06:29.080 --> 06:34.400
Let's say I need to send a sequence of free bytes to some other system.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.920
They need to have values 10, 20, and 30.

06:38.920 --> 06:48.720
To do that, I use distance x, so I use double ankle brackets to start the binary sequence.

06:48.720 --> 06:54.440
And then I write the bytes that I need in sequence and separate it by a comma.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.720
So that's pretty simple.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.960
Yes.

06:58.960 --> 07:05.480
And when I need to receive that data, like if I'm receiving the same sequence of bytes,

07:05.480 --> 07:11.480
I need to decode that into free variables, a, b, and c.

07:11.480 --> 07:15.520
Then I use this syntax, again, double brackets.

07:15.520 --> 07:21.760
Then I put the variables instead of the numbers that I want to extract.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.360
So it's pretty simple.

07:24.360 --> 07:30.400
But of course, we are not really done yet.

07:30.400 --> 07:37.080
It's very few domains where we only work with integers in the sequence of 0 to 255.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
We need larger numbers.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.080
We need negative numbers.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.640
We need floats and strings.

07:42.640 --> 07:48.800
But many languages will just give you a byte stream, and then you need to sort of do a

07:48.800 --> 07:56.480
lot of strange computations to turn that into lists and strings.

07:56.480 --> 08:05.000
But in Elixir and on the Beam, we have the bits and sacks, and we can do more.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.160
Specifically with bits and sacks, we have the option or the ability to specify modifiers.

08:12.160 --> 08:25.320
And the modifiers can specify the type, the sign, the size, unit, and indianess of the

08:25.320 --> 08:30.640
sequence of bits we want to extract from the binary.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.560
So here you see that the type is integer.

08:34.560 --> 08:37.720
It is unsigned, so it's positive numbers only.

08:37.720 --> 08:43.760
It has a size of eight units, and one unit is said to be one bit long.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.280
And it's big indian, which I will talk about later.

08:47.280 --> 08:53.240
So these are all equivalent 10, 20, 30, they are encoded the same way.

08:53.240 --> 08:57.840
It's just different syntaxes.

08:57.840 --> 09:07.760
So you can see if you don't specify any modifiers, these are the defaults that I used instead.

09:07.760 --> 09:13.440
And the second line I used, I omitted size, I just wrote eight.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.520
That's something you can do when you know it has a constant at compile time.

09:17.520 --> 09:24.080
If the size is variable, you will need to use the full size modifier.

09:24.080 --> 09:30.720
And the modifiers can be combined in any order, so you can do whatever you like.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.120
And when we decode it, we use exactly the same syntax.

09:34.120 --> 09:39.000
We can say the same things, like grab the first byte, tell it to compile it that it's

09:39.000 --> 09:46.200
an integer, and then it will extract it like this.

09:46.200 --> 09:52.000
And instead of just going through all the different modifiers and the combinations, I move on

09:52.000 --> 09:55.040
to showcasing some examples.

09:55.040 --> 10:00.600
But before we do that, I want to mention where the bits and text came from.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.880
Bits and text comes from a place of pain.

10:04.880 --> 10:11.800
These two guys, Clairs, Wichström, and Tony Rockwell, were working at the computer science

10:11.800 --> 10:23.000
laboratory at AXN on implementing networking protocols for Erlang, and it was painful.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.760
And so they sat down, since they were so close to the makers of the language, they could

10:28.760 --> 10:33.480
invent a new syntax for use in Erlang.

10:33.480 --> 10:38.760
And this paper, which is published in 1998, describes the first version of the syntax

10:38.760 --> 10:44.000
as it was implemented in an experimental version of Erlang.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.880
I think a few months later, it was released with slightly different syntax, but with all

10:49.880 --> 10:55.040
the same concepts.

10:55.040 --> 11:01.080
And that paper also explains what Indianness is, and it's actually just a fun word for

11:01.080 --> 11:08.320
byte order, because if you have a 16-bit integer that you need to send to some other system,

11:08.320 --> 11:10.240
that's two bytes, right?

11:10.240 --> 11:15.200
And you have to figure out, the one byte is A2, and the other byte is C1.

11:15.200 --> 11:20.920
And you have to figure out which byte do you send first.

11:20.920 --> 11:27.920
Some systems will send the most significant byte first, so that's A2.

11:27.920 --> 11:34.560
But other systems will send the least significant byte first, that's C1.

11:34.560 --> 11:41.080
And so this obviously has consequences, because you need to know the byte order that the system

11:41.080 --> 11:46.520
you're talking to, what it expects, otherwise it just gets confused.

11:46.520 --> 11:53.680
And yes, the byte ordering is said to be big Indian when you start with the most significant

11:53.680 --> 11:58.480
byte, and it's said to be little Indian if you start with the least significant byte.

11:58.480 --> 12:04.000
And this is kind of a thing, I've been working with this for years, but I didn't really know

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
what Indian means, because it's a sort of weird name, right?

12:09.000 --> 12:14.080
But the paper by Claes and Tony hinted me in the direction of finding that by pointing

12:14.080 --> 12:21.560
me to this Internet experiment note from 1980, which is, I think, the first sort of place

12:21.560 --> 12:29.120
where Indian and byte order was used together on holy wars of the plea for peace.

12:29.120 --> 12:39.280
And that sort of shows that this is an important topic, sort of like Vim vs. T-Max, I guess.

12:39.280 --> 12:44.840
And it's actually just, Indian is just a pop culture reference to a book called Gulliver's

12:44.840 --> 12:51.160
Travels, where a seagull travels out into the world and meets the people of Lilliput

12:51.160 --> 12:59.360
and Plefusco, I think, and they are in conflict, because the emperor of Lilliput has commanded

12:59.360 --> 13:05.880
that X must be broken at the little end when you eat them for breakfast or whatever.

13:05.880 --> 13:10.560
So that's obviously absurd, and so they wage a war.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.920
So big Indian means we send the big end of the number first, and the little end means

13:14.920 --> 13:20.080
we send the little end of the number.

13:20.080 --> 13:24.320
So examples of bits and texts.

13:24.320 --> 13:29.520
For the purpose of this talk, I have invented the T-Box, which is a very simple device.

13:29.520 --> 13:34.600
It has a name, and it can measure the temperature, and it can tell you if there's an error in

13:34.600 --> 13:37.560
the time stamp or the measurement.

13:37.560 --> 13:44.160
It has a binary dialect or protocol, which I also invented, and this sort of mirrors

13:44.160 --> 13:51.560
what you will find in a real protocol description for some kind of device.

13:51.560 --> 13:57.680
A client can connect to a T-Box and can send requests to the T-Box, and the T-Box will

13:57.680 --> 14:00.640
respond with a reply.

14:00.640 --> 14:07.640
Every message that is sent includes a header, which is one byte long, and replies from the

14:07.640 --> 14:13.120
T-Box will also contain a value.

14:13.120 --> 14:19.880
The header starts with four bits of magic, which is a constant value that is always there

14:19.880 --> 14:25.400
and is used to sort of make sure this is the beginning of a message.

14:25.400 --> 14:30.840
Then there's a direction bit, which tells whether this message is a request or a reply,

14:30.840 --> 14:37.000
and there's the attribute, three bits, which are used to tell if this is a name or temperature

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
message.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.520
There are extra, we only use one bit in the attribute, but that's just because they expect

14:46.520 --> 14:51.200
to expand the protocol someday.

14:51.200 --> 14:55.600
This is an example of a sequence request-reply.

14:55.600 --> 15:02.760
First we send the request with the header, with the magic bits first, then it's a zero

15:02.760 --> 15:08.080
because the direction is a request, and then we're requesting one, which means we're requesting

15:08.080 --> 15:14.040
the temperature, and then the reply has almost the same header at the beginning, it's just

15:14.040 --> 15:25.640
one in place of the direction, and then the bytes with the value after that.

15:25.640 --> 15:33.400
If you're requesting the name of the T-Box, then it will respond with 12 bytes, and it's

15:33.400 --> 15:35.800
always 12 bytes.

15:35.800 --> 15:42.480
If the name is shorter than 12 bytes, then the rest of the bytes are just null bytes,

15:42.480 --> 15:43.880
and that looks like this.

15:43.880 --> 15:52.680
If the name of the box is fustum, then you have six bytes of actual characters, and then

15:52.680 --> 15:57.560
null bytes for the rest.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.320
The temperature is a little more complicated.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.320
It has three fields.

16:01.320 --> 16:06.840
There's the time, which is a 32-bit integer, counting the number of seconds since 1st

16:06.840 --> 16:09.360
of January, 1970.

16:09.360 --> 16:14.040
Then there's the temperature, which is a 16-bit float, and then there's the quality byte,

16:14.040 --> 16:19.960
which tells you whether there's an error in some of the measurements.

16:19.960 --> 16:23.160
It's the two last bits in the Q-byte that are used.

16:23.160 --> 16:27.120
The second to last bit tells you there's an error in the clock, and the last bit tells

16:27.120 --> 16:30.360
you there's an error in the temperature measurement.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.960
It's important to note that the numbers are little in the end.

16:34.960 --> 16:38.040
This is what a temperature value looks like.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.720
First, it has a timestamp, which is a couple days ago.

16:41.720 --> 16:47.400
Then the temperature, which is 32 degrees about that, and then both of the error bits

16:47.400 --> 16:53.480
are high, so you should not trust the sample.

16:53.480 --> 17:00.840
This syntax, we want to send a request to the T-box to get the name.

17:00.840 --> 17:03.360
I use the double anchor brackets again.

17:03.360 --> 17:08.160
It's all integers, and it's all unsigned, so the only thing I have to specify is the

17:08.160 --> 17:09.160
size.

17:09.160 --> 17:17.080
Here I specify the magic is four bits, then I have my direction, one bit, and the attribute

17:17.080 --> 17:21.960
which is zero for getting the name.

17:21.960 --> 17:27.120
This shows how we can use the bits and tags to encode, easily encode things which are

17:27.120 --> 17:31.120
smaller than bytes.

17:31.120 --> 17:37.160
The reply that comes back looks like this.

17:37.160 --> 17:41.080
When we receive the goodbye, we do like this.

17:41.080 --> 17:49.680
First I want to assert that the message I get back is what I expect.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.920
In place of the header, I assert that the values are what I expect.

17:53.920 --> 18:00.400
I assert that I get the magic bits first, that the direction bit is high so that I know

18:00.400 --> 18:08.560
it's a reply, and that the attribute is zero so that I know it's the name.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.560
This is all true.

18:09.560 --> 18:19.160
I know that the rest of the message is 12 bytes long, and I want to assign that to the

18:19.160 --> 18:20.160
variable name.

18:20.160 --> 18:24.360
Here you can see I will use the bytes modifier.

18:24.360 --> 18:31.040
This changes the type, and it changes the size, or it changes the unit property.

18:31.040 --> 18:35.120
Before with integers, I would specify, like in the header you can see it's two colon

18:35.120 --> 18:36.880
colon four for the magic.

18:36.880 --> 18:43.320
That means four bits, but when I specify bytes, that the type of name is bytes, then

18:43.320 --> 18:54.040
I also say that the 12 means 12 bytes long and not 12 bits long.

18:54.040 --> 19:01.880
That's just to say that the bytes is a type and has different defaults than integers.

19:01.880 --> 19:07.240
When I get the Tbox temperature, I request it like this, pretty much the same as before,

19:07.240 --> 19:13.680
just with a one for the attribute, and for the reply, I again assert on the header that

19:13.680 --> 19:17.040
I get back what I expect.

19:17.040 --> 19:22.960
Then I have the timestamp, which was the 32-bit integer, but little indian, so let's put that

19:22.960 --> 19:29.920
in there, and the temperature, which is a float, 16 bits, also little indian.

19:29.920 --> 19:34.440
Then I discard six bits from the cube byte because they were not used, and then I just

19:34.440 --> 19:44.800
plug the second to last and the last bit out as clock error and temperature error.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.680
That's the basics of bits and tacks.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.840
There's so much more to cover with writing whole applications or libraries to do this

19:52.840 --> 19:57.880
kind of stuff, like what do we do when you don't receive the entire message at once,

19:57.880 --> 20:05.200
you have to frame messages when you're streaming them or receiving them as a stream.

20:05.200 --> 20:11.280
There's generators, there's a special, well, it looks like just a normal forward generator,

20:11.280 --> 20:16.520
but it actually has some special optimizations for working with binaries when you need to

20:16.520 --> 20:18.680
generate a binary.

20:18.680 --> 20:23.720
We could talk about performance tuning, but as I said, I've been working with this for

20:23.720 --> 20:26.880
years and I've never had to really do any performance tuning.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.600
It's pretty performant as is.

20:29.600 --> 20:36.560
That's also one of the points in the paper by Claes and Tony is that this is performant.

20:36.560 --> 20:43.800
Yeah, there are many other tools for working with binaries that help us when we're looking

20:43.800 --> 20:48.280
at this data and not understanding why it's not doing what we expect.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.360
Wireshark is definitely one of them.

20:51.360 --> 20:55.960
I recommend checking that out.

20:55.960 --> 21:01.920
I also recommend if you want to explore more depth, that you check out Protohackers, which

21:01.920 --> 21:11.240
is a sort of advent of code challenge thing about their networking protocols, and Andrea

21:11.240 --> 21:16.160
Lopardi from the Elixir core team has a live stream on YouTube or has streams on YouTube

21:16.160 --> 21:21.080
where he sort of goes through the problems one by one, so that's very good for learning

21:21.080 --> 21:22.080
that.

21:22.080 --> 21:27.800
Andrea has also started writing a book about this kind of stuff.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.800
So that's it.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.800
Thank you.

21:29.800 --> 21:39.360
Thank you for your thoughts, Rolf.

21:39.360 --> 21:44.560
Do you have any questions?

21:44.560 --> 21:46.600
Hi.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.400
Thanks.

21:48.400 --> 21:58.200
So I've done, I've implemented a few binary protocols like network protocols like HTTP

21:58.200 --> 22:00.800
2 or other stuff like that.

22:00.800 --> 22:09.720
I'd love to know how you, if you have done any streaming of data and passing of messages

22:09.720 --> 22:14.280
coming from streaming data and generators also would be interesting just to know how

22:14.280 --> 22:19.560
you approached it because I know I did something but I don't know how we did it.

22:19.560 --> 22:24.320
I think I've implemented a few protocols that use, for example, TCP as the underlying

22:24.320 --> 22:27.240
transport and then that's like a stream.

22:27.240 --> 22:31.000
And then there are a few patterns for how you want to handle that.

22:31.000 --> 22:40.680
I think Frank Honloth and the nerve team wrote a sort of framing behavior, which way

22:40.680 --> 22:44.800
you have a couple of callbacks that you need to implement in order to handle a stream so

22:44.800 --> 22:50.880
that they give you bytes and then you return back messages when you see a full message.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.960
It's actually a very good sort of guideline for how to do that.

22:54.960 --> 23:01.760
Another approach is taken by Andrea Leopardi in his library for Redis where it's like

23:01.760 --> 23:09.160
you call, when you call the decoding function and it returns a result, the result will be

23:09.160 --> 23:14.400
whatever messages was in that binary you gave it and then a continuation function which

23:14.400 --> 23:25.520
you call next time with more bytes so that it continues to return new messages, yeah.

23:25.520 --> 23:31.840
Any question?

23:31.840 --> 23:38.360
If I would buy a T-box from you, do I still get support in about 16 years from now?

23:38.360 --> 23:42.880
Maybe five minutes.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.760
I actually have a question for you if there are no other questions.

23:46.760 --> 23:52.040
Do you have a library you suggest to see?

23:52.040 --> 23:59.400
Because I implemented a library to decode the QOEI which is the quite okay image format

23:59.400 --> 24:05.240
which is a new image format just to get my irons dirty with binary pattern matching in

24:05.240 --> 24:09.280
Elixir but it gets very unwieldy very fast.

24:09.280 --> 24:14.400
So I saw like in JSON they have some macros that generate binary pattern matching.

24:14.400 --> 24:19.520
Do you have any libraries you recommend to check out?

24:19.520 --> 24:24.560
I think the Redis library is pretty nice.

24:24.560 --> 24:30.200
I also have a KNX library which is like a smart home protocol which I don't know if

24:30.200 --> 24:37.800
I would recommend but when I wrote it I thought it was made sense, yeah.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.800
Thank you.

24:38.800 --> 24:43.080
Any other questions?

24:43.080 --> 24:45.800
The last one I guess.

24:45.800 --> 24:50.000
Maybe a word about exceptions when patterns don't match.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.360
You didn't talk about that if I'm correct.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.360
That's true.

24:54.360 --> 24:58.800
I mean sometimes we say we should just let it crash in this community.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.960
That's not always the case.

25:00.960 --> 25:07.160
Sometimes the protocol will say that if you're unable to decode a message you must ignore

25:07.160 --> 25:08.920
it and just continue going.

25:08.920 --> 25:19.000
In that case what I usually do is I define functions where I match on the data I received

25:19.000 --> 25:23.480
and then I always need to have a fallback clause in case it didn't match anything and

25:23.480 --> 25:28.640
then just lock an error and continue.

25:28.640 --> 25:36.720
But I mean probably the proper thing to do in Erlang is to try to just die.

25:36.720 --> 25:40.520
There's also you could when you receive a message you could have a special process that

25:40.520 --> 25:47.160
is only for decoding so you start a task, decode a message and get the data structure

25:47.160 --> 25:54.360
back but I think it depends on the use case how you want to handle bad data.

25:54.360 --> 25:58.800
Okay, thank you very much.
