Hello everyone, we will talk about Kegami, about our corrections applications for Plasma

00:16.040 --> 00:26.800
Mobile and Plasma Desktop, so who I am, I'm a KD developer since 2018, I'm a member of

00:26.800 --> 00:34.680
the KD EV Foundation since 2019 and I started using the KD by basically like working on the

00:34.680 --> 00:41.480
website and the commutations and then I started doing applications. I worked with multiple

00:41.480 --> 00:47.120
Kegami applications, not to learn, for example Nailchart, Matrix Client, Contrast, Contrast

00:47.120 --> 00:53.440
Shaking applications, Tokodon, Muslim Client, Calendar, like it's like a calendar applications

00:53.440 --> 00:58.800
but also like there's a bit more fun calendar, for example contacts and soon emails and I

00:58.800 --> 01:07.000
am now like an hip-hop reader. I work at Kedab but she started three years ago before I

01:07.000 --> 01:18.120
worked at Nest Hub. So what is Kegami? Kegami is like a framework, you have to tweak it to

01:18.120 --> 01:25.240
basically like build project applications, it's written in QML, the QML is like a language

01:25.240 --> 01:35.760
delivery paper by Qt, it's a declarative language, basically like it's sort of mix of JSON and

01:35.760 --> 01:43.400
JavaScript and that's really good integration with C++, so you can always use C++ often.

01:43.400 --> 01:51.320
It was basically Kegami was developed to build mobile and applications in the Nokia times

01:51.320 --> 02:02.640
when Qt was updated by Nokia and that's why we are also using that for past mobile but

02:02.640 --> 02:07.040
also like to develop original applications not only for mobile but also for desktop.

02:07.040 --> 02:19.400
So yeah, basically how it works is that you have multiple pages, you can see like two pages,

02:19.400 --> 02:26.600
one of them is the list of emails and the second page with the content of the email.

02:26.600 --> 02:33.720
There's also like a driver concept, basically you can have things on the left and right,

02:33.720 --> 02:42.000
additional information, this is like a thing or it looks on the stock and on mobile you

02:42.000 --> 02:50.640
get only one page displayed at the right time, like you can see of two and only one, but it's

02:50.640 --> 03:00.280
quite the same UI, it's still like the same code but right and for the better, the drivers

03:00.280 --> 03:09.720
are also mobile friendly, so you can see on the left you have some of the collapses.

03:09.720 --> 03:15.920
Basically there's two ways to have page pages, either you put them in the column, like here,

03:15.920 --> 03:28.680
this page is for each of us, or you can as a layer on top of each of us and each page

03:28.680 --> 03:35.200
has some actions, you can basically add some buttons on the top, details if you want, but

03:35.200 --> 03:40.760
basically like how you build the key applications, you see like there's like a few concepts with

03:40.760 --> 03:46.600
the pages and the drivers and that basically of most of the key applications that they

03:46.600 --> 03:47.600
will put.

03:47.600 --> 03:52.800
For example, for shell applications like NeoChat, you only have two pages, one left for the list

03:52.800 --> 04:10.520
of users or sheds and one right with a few sheds, and yeah, it's as it looks, yeah.

04:10.520 --> 04:17.400
And basically like how Kigami started was 2015, we announced Plasma Mobile, but at that

04:17.400 --> 04:22.280
time we are still using the Plasma components, so basically the same components that we are

04:22.280 --> 04:27.480
using for the Plasma desktop, we are using them to create applications, but these are

04:27.480 --> 04:33.280
squeezing issues because first they got a look of Plasma applets as in applications,

04:33.280 --> 04:39.800
key applications, maybe as in the net convergence, so you are basically like to build applications

04:39.800 --> 04:46.480
for mobile and other applications for desktop, same for safety, there's a lot of duplications

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
of efforts.

04:47.480 --> 04:57.120
So I try like one year later with Marco Matting, I'm a tinder of Kigami, created Kigami to

04:57.120 --> 05:05.240
basically only have to build one applications for both mobile and desktop, I mean this is

05:05.240 --> 05:16.600
like a long time ago, eight years ago, seven years ago, and then we tried to add more integration

05:16.600 --> 05:22.480
with the desktop because even at the beginning of the Kigami applications we are more like

05:22.480 --> 05:29.480
mobile applications still, so one of the things that we did first was like to create a team

05:29.480 --> 05:36.920
for the desktop called QQC2 desktop team, basically like critical controls, the framework

05:36.920 --> 05:43.800
that we are, the critical QML allows you to have teams that basically implement the features,

05:43.800 --> 05:54.120
so we have like a desktop team, what is, looks like a desktop applications, normal QQQ applications.

05:54.120 --> 05:58.120
When you're later, we did a lot of work as well as the colors, but they use the same

05:58.120 --> 06:07.880
colors and the desktop, as a Kigami application uses the same colors as normal QQQ applications.

06:07.880 --> 06:19.360
Before 2020, there was like almost no device that we could use Kigami, so the desktop was

06:19.360 --> 06:27.800
quite slow, because I mean there was Nexus 5, what kind of works with, but it was still

06:27.800 --> 06:38.320
small, old device that was slow, really slow, and yeah, when there was 2020, Pine 64 announced

06:38.320 --> 06:44.760
the Pine phone, and I think that really helped to get new contributors, and I mean as a way

06:44.760 --> 06:51.440
I started contributing to PlusNorway, it was a natural Pine phone, you add finally like

06:51.440 --> 07:05.440
a device that you could buy, and what supported Linux on, yeah, and last year, we also launched

07:05.440 --> 07:14.360
the Kigami add-ons, I will go more on to that later, yeah, basically like, at the recent

07:14.360 --> 07:23.040
times, we like felt it brought in new components, like for example, yes, the settings from Tocodon,

07:23.040 --> 07:34.560
the Mustang account, yeah, we worked for example, there was a new chat, there was a list to have

07:34.560 --> 07:48.080
a nice look, and again, the Tocodon settings, actually it's a mobile form components, but

07:48.080 --> 07:52.960
it allows to basically, mostly doing forms, but we are also using that for other stuff,

07:52.960 --> 07:58.040
basically display information, we are still a bit the idea of GNOME for that, because

07:58.040 --> 08:07.560
they look quite nice, and it allows basically like some comparisons of the forms, one of

08:07.560 --> 08:15.840
the last introductions, we added to Kigami, we are going to do this as a tree views, it's

08:15.840 --> 08:27.960
in calendars, it allows to do tree, display information as a tree, pretty useful for the

08:27.960 --> 08:36.240
task view in a calendar, where you can see the task and the task, yeah, another one last

08:36.240 --> 08:42.080
introduction that I created, what I contributed to is a search pop-up, it's a nice component,

08:42.080 --> 08:46.680
where you can basically have a search filled with a pop-up, but up here, when you click

08:46.680 --> 08:58.600
on it with the results, it's pretty nice, I think, with nice animations, but yeah, that's

08:58.600 --> 08:59.600
mostly it.

08:59.600 --> 09:18.520
Thank you very much, questions, comments, yeah, yeah, I was interested in how many devices

09:18.520 --> 09:33.320
support platform mobile, or most productive device to use platform mobile?

09:33.320 --> 09:34.320
Can you repeat?

09:34.320 --> 09:35.320
What kind of devices support platform mobile well?

09:35.320 --> 09:40.080
I mean there is a pine phone, a pine phone poor, that's like supporting it as well, when

09:40.080 --> 09:44.720
there's a basically platform mobile team doesn't really like do all the other implementations,

09:44.720 --> 09:52.720
we focus on the UI, because it's where we are quite good at, but the post-market OS

09:52.720 --> 09:58.560
folks, I mean, everything that's on post-market OS, for example, can run platform mobile,

09:58.560 --> 10:03.640
because it's basically like just a shell on top of post-market OS, or Manjaro, as a mobile

10:03.640 --> 10:10.960
edition, and there's like a lot of other small distributions, I think, open source as a mobile

10:10.960 --> 10:15.400
variant, and basically everything that's called mainline.

10:15.400 --> 10:22.160
The important thing is that it needs to be mainline support, we at the beginning supported

10:22.160 --> 10:30.320
other like, not mainline devices, but we had to stop that, because there's too much work

10:30.320 --> 10:35.280
to support both this sort of device and mainline, we had a lot of issues with telecommunications

10:35.280 --> 10:47.640
stack, because we had the LiboFono, what we were using, but it wasn't really working well

10:47.640 --> 11:00.960
for us, so we switched to a network mobile manager, but basically every device that runs

11:00.960 --> 11:05.840
mainline Linux would also run platform mobile, I mean, you can also run it on the desktop

11:05.840 --> 11:10.960
if you wanted, I wouldn't recommend that, but you can also do that.

11:10.960 --> 11:16.720
May I ask one more question, Isra, what is the long term of the platform mobile project,

11:16.720 --> 11:17.720
what's your goal?

11:17.720 --> 11:37.960
I mean, we have partnership with Pine 64, so they shipped personal phones, but it's

11:37.960 --> 11:46.720
quite hard to, I mean, Pine is no mainstream mobile manifesto as support for mainline

11:46.720 --> 11:51.240
Linux, and they're not really interested to support that, and they're not really interested

11:51.240 --> 11:58.880
to have something else run under it, because I mean, there's not enough applications,

11:58.880 --> 12:04.520
I mean, it's one of the issues, under its ecosystem has a lot of applications, we can

12:04.520 --> 12:12.320
actually like, there's a way to run applications on past mobile, but see like, yes, before

12:12.320 --> 12:21.200
we can maybe see like a, it's run on installed on our mainstream devices.

12:21.200 --> 12:25.720
I'm mostly focusing on applications, because that's the thing, it's a part where we are

12:25.720 --> 12:36.720
lacking the most native applications, I don't really do the pass-machel stuff.

12:36.720 --> 12:37.720
Other questions?

12:37.720 --> 12:45.040
Do you have some kind of support for progressive web apps?

12:45.040 --> 12:51.000
I think there is, as a browser, I think there is, does support, okay, see web app, you

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
know, correctly, was implemented by Yonah a few years ago.

12:56.000 --> 13:06.440
Do you have any support for switching light mode and dark mode?

13:06.440 --> 13:14.280
Basically it's using the color shims API, but basically it works, so if you, in your

13:14.280 --> 13:20.920
chat it's implemented, you can basically switch on the color shims, but by default it just

13:20.920 --> 13:27.040
follows what the plasma colors are, so if you are, it's basically like we are trying

13:27.040 --> 13:35.880
to have the key applications that are quite new and not yet completely mature, to like

13:35.880 --> 13:40.680
hooks and have exactly like the older QT widget applications, so basically like if you change

13:40.680 --> 13:48.840
the colors, every application will change the colors, the QT widget one and the QT one.

13:48.840 --> 13:53.680
But you can as well implement, especially what one application should only be one team,

13:53.680 --> 13:55.680
one color, as possible.

13:55.680 --> 13:56.680
Yeah?

13:56.680 --> 14:06.680
Do you see more KD desktop applications being ported to Kirigami in the future?

14:06.680 --> 14:12.840
It's always like a bit of a controversial team, I'm, I've been with Calendar, I've been basically

14:12.840 --> 14:20.840
like, watching with Clodio, the entire PIM stack, all the KOOF applications, like Calendar,

14:20.840 --> 14:27.600
Mail, Contact, it's quite a bit of work, I think it's worth it because it looks a bit

14:27.600 --> 14:36.320
more nicer, but it's still like a lot of work to get it completely right, and I'm, what

14:36.320 --> 14:40.840
you really want is basically like, at least the Kirigami applications and the QT widget

14:40.840 --> 14:44.640
applications, because we can't get rid of all the QT widget applications and what everything

14:44.640 --> 14:53.520
looks the same, what they work the same, so when you interact with it, it should be like

14:53.520 --> 14:54.520
consistent.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.520
I mean, that's our goal, because we can't just go with everything in Kirigami.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.520
Thank you.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.520
No more?

15:00.520 --> 15:01.520
If not, then thank you very much.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.520
Yeah.

15:02.520 --> 15:15.240
So, we have 15 minutes left.
