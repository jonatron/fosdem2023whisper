In Christian's talk at FOSDEM, he discussed HPC container conformance, a project from the HPC Container Advisory Council that focuses on providing best practices for building and annotating HPC Containers, specifically for the applications Gromax and PyTorch. The focus is on OCI images and Docker files, and annotations are intended to both describe the contents and usage of the image, as well as to lead to improved discovery and configuration of the container. Christian discussed a suggested set of annotation groups, including hardware and HPC related information, as well as sysadmin and documentation annotations. The project hopes to complement existing software supply chain method databases, while also focusing on HPC specific needs.
