This talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 focused on the problem of managing complex technical ecosystems, particularly in the context of digital experience platforms. The speaker highlighted the state of the art, including microservices, API-first architectures, cloud native systems, and headless approaches. They then discussed the challenges of integrating multiple systems and ensuring coherence and consistency in the user experience. They introduced Meiosis, a component compiler by Build.io, and demonstrated how it can be used to create reusable components that work across different frameworks like React and Vue. They also mentioned other tools like NX for managing monorepos and Uniform for orchestrating the components and data in a visual editor-like interface. The speaker emphasized that their approach is an exploration and not a silver bullet, but it aims to reduce friction and allow developers to focus more on the presentation layer of their applications.
