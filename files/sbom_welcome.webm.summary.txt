The talk is a brief introduction to S-bombs, which stands for Software Bill of Materials. The speaker explains that S-bombs provide information about the components used in building software, including libraries, modules, open source or proprietary components, and more. The minimum elements of an S-bomb include a supplier component name, version of the component, a unique identifier, dependency relationships, authors of the data, and timestamp. The talk also mentions different types of S-bombs, including source, build, analyze, deploy, and runtime. The speakers urge others to provide clarity on the type of S-bomb they are working with throughout the conference presentations. The talk ends by introducing the first speaker, who will discuss more tools working on S-bombs.
