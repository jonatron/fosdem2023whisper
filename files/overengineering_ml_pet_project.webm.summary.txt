The talk is about automating weight loss using AI. The speaker created a project that locks his PC every hour and forces him to do push-ups by using AI. The project involves using different AI models, such as the open-source hardware AI camera called Oak One for post-estimation and a push-up detector. The speaker also used a voice recognition package for Python to take pictures during the workout. The project is managed and trained using ClearML, an open-source MLops tool, and includes training a simple classifier using Scikit-learn. The talk also includes a description of how the speaker locks and unlocks his computer using Linux and Xdo tool.
