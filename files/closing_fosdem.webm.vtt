WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.540
So, that was a blast, and we are finally back in person, and also I'm going to take another

00:12.540 --> 00:16.140
picture because we're finally in person.

00:16.140 --> 00:21.940
Once again, if you leave, please be quiet, because it is extremely loud up here, and

00:21.940 --> 00:26.020
no, you're not special enough that you should keep talking.

00:26.020 --> 00:29.500
Thank you very much.

00:29.500 --> 00:43.560
So, it's a wrap.

00:43.560 --> 00:49.200
Random stats, because stats are fun and easy to make, sometimes it was a little bit of a

00:49.200 --> 00:50.200
rush.

00:50.200 --> 00:55.640
Our peak this time was 1.5 gigs in concurrent outgoing streams.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.640
Once again, please quiet if you decide to leave.

00:59.640 --> 01:05.240
Last year we had 1.65 gigabits peak, and that was fully online, so that gives you a rough

01:05.240 --> 01:11.200
idea of how many people still chose to consume off-site, even though we have a relatively

01:11.200 --> 01:16.080
full foster, but not as packed as 2020 we think we estimate.

01:16.080 --> 01:26.760
35 rooms, 800 concurrent viewers, and roughly 20K unique viewers on the streams.

01:26.760 --> 01:31.320
We have a total of almost 400 hours of scheduled video for the ones tracking the numbers over

01:31.320 --> 01:32.320
the years.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.520
That is less than the last two years, because physical ULB has less space and less death

01:36.520 --> 01:43.240
rooms than fully virtual, but still we managed to fit quite some stuff in.

01:43.240 --> 01:51.320
We already have 53 released videos online, and 21 are currently being reviewed and transcoding

01:51.320 --> 01:54.760
for a total of almost one full day of video.

01:54.760 --> 02:00.960
Speaking of video, if you are a speaker or if you are a death room manager, please, please,

02:00.960 --> 02:07.080
please, please, with sugar on top, you get those emails and you do what is in those emails,

02:07.080 --> 02:11.920
and please help us review them, because if you don't do it as a speaker, it falls on

02:11.920 --> 02:15.960
the death room managers to do it, and if the death room managers don't do it, it falls

02:15.960 --> 02:20.880
on staff to do it, and it's a lot of work and a lot of video, because 400 hours of video

02:20.880 --> 02:21.880
is a lot.

02:21.880 --> 02:25.560
So please, if you are a speaker, if you are a death room manager, those emails are important,

02:25.560 --> 02:29.680
do not ignore them if you have any issues, email video at fostermorg, and they come from

02:29.680 --> 02:32.880
no reply at fostermorg.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.440
Matrix also dropped, of course, obviously a lot of people are in person, but still we

02:36.440 --> 02:42.640
had quite some online participation slash online synchronization while people were rocking

02:42.640 --> 02:46.320
the hallway track and attending talks and such.

02:46.320 --> 02:50.760
We sold out of Schwag, we weren't fully certain, like, we didn't know what we have a fully

02:50.760 --> 02:55.040
packed ULB, would we have almost nothing, anything in between, but we managed to sell

02:55.040 --> 02:59.080
out, so that's good, and we also had 130 advanced orders.

02:59.080 --> 03:06.000
For those who don't know, we will continue to give you the ability to order Schwag beforehand,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.360
which means you just get a voucher, and you get a password, and you get two front desk,

03:09.360 --> 03:13.200
and you get it immediately, we don't have to do the payment, dance everything, and also

03:13.200 --> 03:18.720
maybe, depending on how the timeline works out, maybe we even can start ordering specifically

03:18.720 --> 03:23.160
for you as you do advanced orders.

03:23.160 --> 03:29.280
There was a lot of food consumed, there's actually two slides.

03:29.280 --> 03:46.880
There's a lot, and it's not even a full number, because this is as of 1530 local.

03:46.880 --> 03:50.480
Once again, thank you, it's really loud.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.680
Network, we stopped checking MAC addresses for various reasons, network was a little bit

03:54.680 --> 03:59.800
of a mess this year, because a lot of things broke, which we thought remotely were fine,

03:59.800 --> 04:06.280
but the MACs concurrent we saw for IPv6 addresses being assigned was over 30K, and the total

04:06.280 --> 04:11.280
amount which we gave out was 53K, people switched from one network to the other, blah, blah,

04:11.280 --> 04:15.800
blah, blah, so it's not a fully scientific method, and also privacy extensions which

04:15.800 --> 04:24.640
keep basically messing up all our stats, but it's at least not a little.

04:24.640 --> 04:32.360
Also, ULB has some traffic analysis on their controllers we don't for obvious privacy reasons,

04:32.360 --> 04:37.520
so you can guess what for the first time since they installed that stuff was the top website

04:37.520 --> 04:55.680
or the top site accessed by total volume of data going to and back, any guesses?

04:55.680 --> 05:02.400
Obviously.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.880
We also had some stats, initially we kept them at 2.5, but we switched from one gig

05:07.880 --> 05:12.560
to 10 gig over the weekend, because that's how we rock, and we actually managed to consume

05:12.560 --> 05:15.960
more than the one gigabit which we had before.

05:15.960 --> 05:23.440
Going forward, hopefully next year we will maybe even have two times 10 gig, we'll see.

05:23.440 --> 05:30.600
I keep telling people this every year, if you're still using 2.4 gigahertz, please don't.

05:30.600 --> 05:39.320
With hardware which does 5 gigahertz, of course you will have less contention, you won't have

05:39.320 --> 05:44.880
zero contention, but you will have less contention if you have hardware with 5 gigahertz.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.160
It's generally nicer, so if you buy your next laptop, your next whatever, consider spending

05:49.160 --> 05:52.960
a little bit more money on 5 gigahertz.

05:52.960 --> 05:53.960
We come to thank yous.

05:53.960 --> 06:10.120
First of all, the Matrix and Element people, who asked to not be named, just like so listed.

06:10.120 --> 06:31.080
Also Liberaget staff, of course, and also sponsors without whose this wouldn't be possible.

06:31.080 --> 06:37.560
As per usual, as I call out the next groups, if you wear a color t-shirt of the appropriate

06:37.560 --> 06:41.800
color, please come up front and take your applause.

06:41.800 --> 07:08.200
I might start crying again, I'll see.

07:08.200 --> 07:15.000
Thank you.

07:38.200 --> 07:48.200
I also see at least one green and one orange shirt, which is not up front, which is a big mistake.

07:48.200 --> 08:04.200
If you don't have the shirt on, but you did volunteering, deaf room, video, whatever,

08:04.200 --> 08:06.200
please come up front.

08:06.200 --> 08:25.200
We have a few deaf who are also supposed to come up front now.

08:36.200 --> 08:44.200
And thank you.

08:44.200 --> 09:01.200
As per always, please send feedback.

09:01.200 --> 09:06.200
We really rely on this feedback and we actually take it to heart, so please send any and all feedback which you have.

09:06.200 --> 09:21.200
We cannot always accommodate it, but we read everything and we really do take it to heart.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.200
That should be helping, not feedback, whatever.

09:24.200 --> 09:30.200
If you see trash here anywhere else, congratulations, this is your trash now.

09:30.200 --> 09:40.200
And I'm being serious, it is an immense amount of work to build up in basically half a day on Friday and also to tear down within two to four hours on Sunday.

09:40.200 --> 09:46.200
So anything you see, please just take it with you, throw it in the trash, whatever, but please help us clean.

09:46.200 --> 09:53.200
Also speaking of cleaning, if you have some time, we would highly appreciate it if you just stayed around a little bit, helped us clean up.

09:53.200 --> 10:00.200
If you gather here, we will tell you what to do and what it will take a little bit until we have all you segmented.

10:00.200 --> 10:06.200
But we can use every single hand for the network cabling which you tear out under guidance.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.200
You can keep the network cable.

10:08.200 --> 10:14.200
And also for the ones who stay until the very end and help until the very end, we will feed you in cable at the end.

10:14.200 --> 10:19.200
So please consider just coming up front to help.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.200
Yes, after the thing, obviously.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.200
And that's it. So see you next year.

10:24.200 --> 10:39.200
And as is tradition.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.200
And as is tradition.

10:41.200 --> 10:46.200
So A, I forgot all the speakers who are in here, they also are supposed to be on stage if they so choose.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.200
So now is the time to come on stage if you want to.

10:48.200 --> 10:53.200
And as is tradition, we are ending FOSDEM with the FOSDEM dance.

10:53.200 --> 10:58.200
My knee is kind of broken, so I'm not going to lead the dance.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.200
Wouter is going to lead the dance.

11:00.200 --> 11:11.200
And with that, thank you. See you next year.

11:11.200 --> 11:18.200
I don't know who among you has done the FOSDEM dance before. It's actually quite difficult.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.200
But not really.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.200
We start like this.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.200
And it's difficult because you have to balance on one leg.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.200
But I'm sure you can all do that, right?

11:28.200 --> 11:30.200
So bear with me.

11:30.200 --> 11:35.200
And then we lift the one leg.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.200
And then we start moving.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.200
And we go faster.

11:43.200 --> 11:49.200
And there we go. We're dancing.

11:49.200 --> 11:59.200
Thank you.

11:59.200 --> 12:08.200
That was the official FOSDEM dance.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.200
Thank you.
