In this talk, Babis and Anastasios discuss the use of VXL for hardware acceleration in Unikernels. They explain that Unikernels are a promising technology for fast boot times, low memory footprint, and increased security. However, there is currently no support for hardware acceleration in Unikernels. They propose using VXL as a solution, as it can abstract the heterogeneity of hardware and software, making it a suitable fit for Unikernels. They demonstrate how VXL can be easily integrated into different acceleration frameworks and used in Unikernel environments. They also address concerns about performance and security, stating that the overhead of the transport layer is minimal and that security can be ensured through proper auditing and isolation measures. They conclude by inviting the audience to try out VXL and participate in the Unikraft hackathon.
