WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
Great pleasure to be here. Can you all hear me at the back? Can you? Yeah, thank you.

00:12.720 --> 00:17.400
Yeah, wow. What was them? Thank you to the organizers and for the staff for inviting

00:17.400 --> 00:23.920
me here. It's a great pleasure to be here. And yeah, if you asked me a year ago, would

00:23.920 --> 00:29.800
I be here? I'd be like, no, because I hadn't actually heard of FOS. Apologies at that point.

00:29.800 --> 00:34.200
If I'd be told that I'll be talking about Rose Garden, which is something I've not

00:34.200 --> 00:43.760
worked on myself for a very long time, not contributed to, I'd be doubly surprised. However,

00:43.760 --> 00:49.000
I think it's important to look back sometimes. And I've called this talk a slumbering, yeah,

00:49.000 --> 00:52.960
Rose Garden a slumbering giant. And I thought, I didn't really think when I was putting this

00:52.960 --> 00:56.200
submission in as well. So I thought a slumbering giant, that made sense to me at the time. Who

00:56.200 --> 01:02.840
knows what slumbering actually means? Okay, I should explain that, because I was thinking

01:02.840 --> 01:07.360
about maybe changing. So slumbering actually means not quite sleeping, but also not quite

01:07.360 --> 01:11.360
awake either. And it's kind of in relation to the fact that Rose Garden has been around

01:11.360 --> 01:16.440
for a very long time. Maybe just as a show of hands as well. How many people have used,

01:16.440 --> 01:23.400
okay, let's start off simply. How many people have used computers to make music? Okay, so

01:23.400 --> 01:27.200
we've got about 20 maybe. That's pretty good. Keep your hand up if you use Linux to make

01:27.200 --> 01:34.600
music. Okay, that's actually more, I think. That's weird. Okay. About the same maybe.

01:34.600 --> 01:40.160
So how many people have heard of Rose Garden? Okay, it's not bad. Not impressed. Okay, good,

01:40.160 --> 01:52.160
good stuff. So Rose Garden started actually longer than 20 years ago. Let me show you.

01:52.160 --> 01:59.160
So this is the kind of current Rose Garden. This is how it looks now. And if you're familiar

01:59.160 --> 02:06.480
with Linux, sorry, with music software, by the way, I've got a pointer. Can you see it?

02:06.480 --> 02:10.320
Yeah, it's cool. I usually just use it to torture cats, but this is the first time I've

02:10.320 --> 02:16.400
actually used it on a presentation. So yeah, if you're unfamiliar with digital audio work

02:16.400 --> 02:22.240
stations, I'll give you a little tour. So we have down here some instruments, and you

02:22.240 --> 02:27.120
can map to those tracks, and they're either MIDI tracks, which is musical instrument,

02:27.120 --> 02:32.600
digital interface tracks, or you can have audio tracks too. And this is how Rose Garden

02:32.600 --> 02:37.840
essentially works. It allows you to compose. It allows you to record into it from a digital

02:37.840 --> 02:52.120
instrument, or from an analog instrument, and then you can edit it on the screen. Just

02:52.120 --> 02:56.400
to go back to the beginning, the talk today as well is going to be about the history of

02:56.400 --> 03:02.760
Rose Garden. It's going to be about how I believe that good engineering practice could

03:02.760 --> 03:10.800
talk, is interesting talk, the last talk from Brian about using the latest tools and technology

03:10.800 --> 03:14.640
to understand how open source software can be better. So as part of this talk, I'm going

03:14.640 --> 03:19.120
to look at how Rose Garden was put together in the first place, and why I believe it's

03:19.120 --> 03:22.440
still around because of the way it was put together, and because of some of the design

03:22.440 --> 03:30.400
decisions that we made during the creation of it. Oh yeah, if I didn't mention, there's

03:30.400 --> 03:33.120
a QR code here. If you want to scan that, you can go to a page where there'll be some

03:33.120 --> 03:41.680
links. I'll also share this at the end. Rose Garden was really a kind of a labour of love.

03:41.680 --> 03:46.560
It was almost an accidental success, but it was kind of done deliberately in a way. That

03:46.560 --> 03:51.760
doesn't really make any sense, but Rose Garden came about originally from a university project.

03:51.760 --> 03:56.960
So it's actually a lot older than 20 years. It's almost 30 years old. In fact, it's over

03:56.960 --> 04:07.400
20 years old. And then it became something of its own thing. So just diving back into

04:07.400 --> 04:12.760
how it looks these days again. So we've got a piano roll editor on one side and a notation

04:12.760 --> 04:15.520
editor on the other. And this was one of the great powers of the original Rose Garden,

04:15.520 --> 04:23.800
as well. It had both notation editing and MIDI editing too. And this is the current Rose

04:23.800 --> 04:29.040
Garden homepage where you can download it and you can see how often it's raced. So up here,

04:29.040 --> 04:36.880
you can see there was a release in December. The current maintainer, Ted, works very hard

04:36.880 --> 04:42.440
on these. And when I'm talking about the engineering processes that go behind it, you'll see towards

04:42.440 --> 04:46.560
the end of the presentation that there's a lot of manual work involved still. So some

04:46.560 --> 04:51.960
of the best practices that we get through our day jobs can actually help us understand

04:51.960 --> 05:00.760
how we can make software like this more maintainable and easier to release. It's not untypical

05:00.760 --> 05:10.280
as well for large and old software products like this to have quite slow release cycles.

05:10.280 --> 05:14.840
And typically, once it's released, it goes into the usual repositories where it can be

05:14.840 --> 05:24.040
created and packaged for download on various different distributions, Linux distributions.

05:24.040 --> 05:29.400
It's been translated into around 20 different languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Italian,

05:29.400 --> 05:42.400
Spanish, Finnish, German loads. And over the last 20 years, it's been downloaded all over

05:42.400 --> 05:49.880
the world, as you can imagine. And this is some stats. So interestingly enough, we're

05:49.880 --> 05:56.360
still on SourceForge. That's down to the developers having a certain way of looking at things.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.840
So SourceForge is the preferred way of looking at things for a lot of the developers because

05:59.840 --> 06:03.000
they've been involved in it for a long time. And perhaps they're a little bit behind the

06:03.000 --> 06:08.680
times. So they like to dig their heels in sometimes when it comes to what is acceptable

06:08.680 --> 06:13.320
in terms of the technology that is being used. So the good part about it is that we have

06:13.320 --> 06:18.440
all the stats from the beginning of time, basically, all the way to today on how many

06:18.440 --> 06:21.800
times it gets downloaded. And this is source packages only, essentially, as well. So it's

06:21.800 --> 06:29.000
not bad. I mean, its height, it was 5,000 source package downloads per month. And even

06:29.000 --> 06:33.880
with the last release, it was still around 2,000. So if you add that into the mix with

06:33.880 --> 06:40.080
all the pre-packaged stuff that happens for the distributions, then it's pretty tidy

06:40.080 --> 06:52.000
amount. So who am I and why am I here? So I worked on Rose Garden between 95 and 2004-2005.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.440
I'm now independent consultant. And I kind of specialized mainly in software delivery

06:56.440 --> 07:03.960
and customer focus. And that means that over the years, as a professional software engineer,

07:03.960 --> 07:07.560
I've learned various techniques which has helped me understand, OK, well, maybe we could

07:07.560 --> 07:13.200
do things slightly better. And I'd like to talk and write about this right now. And this

07:13.200 --> 07:23.880
is how this talk, I suppose, kind of came about because I was thinking, what is the

07:23.880 --> 07:28.320
project that gave me the most pleasure over these years? And when it comes down to it,

07:28.320 --> 07:36.080
undoubtedly Rose Garden was the thing. And some of the takeaways I believe that we can

07:36.080 --> 07:44.640
get from this is to understand how open-source software becomes important and how it stays

07:44.640 --> 07:59.160
important as a social enterprise. So this is really a story about motivation and why

07:59.160 --> 08:11.760
we do things the way we do. And how open-source software becomes something that can take

08:11.760 --> 08:17.880
over our lives as well. So just to expand on that a little bit, I've kind of broke

08:17.880 --> 08:22.880
it down to three areas, which I believe are the core components of how open-source kind

08:22.880 --> 08:29.640
of gets good, how open-source projects become a thing in the first place and how they then

08:29.640 --> 08:38.680
sustain themselves. And it's mainly, spoilers, mainly around the social exercise. We do it

08:38.680 --> 08:43.960
because we kind of want to. We're driven to do it. Of course, we do it as well because

08:43.960 --> 08:48.680
we can't do it by ourselves. So that's number one for me, is the effort that it takes to

08:48.680 --> 08:54.440
build something. So when you look at something like Rose Garden or any other huge open-source

08:54.440 --> 08:58.680
project, you end up with hundreds of thousands of lines of code and lots of contributors

08:58.680 --> 09:07.000
from all over the world doing various different things, either writing code themselves, becoming

09:07.000 --> 09:11.960
different, doing translations, helping out the website with documentation. And this is

09:11.960 --> 09:15.680
a snapshot from the Rose Garden website of the contributors that have been involved over

09:15.680 --> 09:31.800
the years. Secondly, you can't do it without effort, you can't do it without support. This

09:31.800 --> 09:40.920
is a picture of the time that's elapsed between when I stopped working on Rose Garden and

09:40.920 --> 09:47.400
pretty much today. This is my son, Sam. He was one when I took a photo of him and put

09:47.400 --> 09:58.600
him on this poster to kind of be used at one of the sound expos that we did in 2004. And

09:58.600 --> 10:05.360
this is him last year as he graduated from high school. And this was probably the reason

10:05.360 --> 10:13.800
why I stopped contributing to Rose Garden this time because I went off to have a family.

10:13.800 --> 10:20.240
And of course the family is important for support, so they have to keep you going, maintaining

10:20.240 --> 10:35.320
your energy to be able to do stuff. In addition to that, we also see how the working world

10:35.320 --> 11:02.680
comes into play, one second. So after university, I went into, sorry. It's out of the working

11:02.680 --> 11:08.320
world shape, our experience and our perception of what goes on in the open source land. So

11:08.320 --> 11:14.480
after university, basically after Rose Garden first came out, going into engineering and

11:14.480 --> 11:17.920
becoming a person who would actually grow as an engineer and then be able to feed back

11:17.920 --> 11:35.280
into that project. So this is taking, this is the start, basically, of Rose Garden. So

11:35.280 --> 11:40.880
I went to Bartholomew University between 1990 and 1994. Rose Garden started as a university

11:40.880 --> 11:47.560
project by a couple of friends of mine, Chris Canham and Melissa Wilson. And they did it

11:47.560 --> 11:52.400
for a final year of projects at Barth, and it was written for John Fitch, who was one

11:52.400 --> 11:58.560
of the computer science professors there. His idea to come up with a UNIX sequencer and

11:58.560 --> 12:03.340
notation editor. I think it was the combined thing that he came up with together. So Rose

12:03.340 --> 12:09.240
Garden itself was born of a university project in around 1992. And the name is a bit strange.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.720
So Rose Garden, where does that come from? It's actually, thanks to these guys, these

12:12.720 --> 12:20.640
were a band called Bow House, who come out of Northampton in the UK from 1978. And Chris

12:20.640 --> 12:26.200
Canham, one of the lead developers, the originators of Rose Garden, he was a big fan of Bow House

12:26.200 --> 12:31.760
and he had one of the songs called Rose Garden, Funeral of Sores, which is actually a song

12:31.760 --> 12:39.280
by John Kale. And he, being a bit of a wag, thought, it's probably going to be crap, this

12:39.280 --> 12:46.320
notation editor. So we'll call it Rose Garden after Funeral of Scores, haha, Scores Notation,

12:46.320 --> 12:55.440
get it? So yeah, that was the origination of the name. So 1992, it was written on UNIX,

12:55.440 --> 13:01.880
it was written on SGI originally, under Erics, with the Athena widget set. It was a modified

13:01.880 --> 13:08.560
Athena widget set, written in C. And it looked pretty good. I mean, I think Chris did a pretty

13:08.560 --> 13:12.640
good job, actually, despite the fact he thought it would be terrible. This is actually Rose

13:12.640 --> 13:19.400
Garden 1.0, the source code. However, I believe this screenshot comes from Rose Garden 2.1,

13:19.400 --> 13:25.200
which is the first Linux port of that source code. And as you can see, it's got a piano

13:25.200 --> 13:33.640
roll editor, an event editor. It's also got the notation, oops, and it also works together

13:33.640 --> 13:38.480
on the same screen like that. So it was pretty advanced. And it worked via the Erics device,

13:38.480 --> 13:44.520
so it would actually send out to a MIDI device from the SGI, the Silicon Graphics workstation.

13:44.520 --> 13:50.320
That was it, number one. That was done for a final year project. So what happened next?

13:50.320 --> 13:54.360
Well, what happened along the side of that was that we ended up spending a lot of time

13:54.360 --> 14:01.960
mucking around. So in 1992, 1993, I was still at university. Chris and Melissa were peers

14:01.960 --> 14:07.080
of mine, friends of mine too, and we used to hang around in the Spark Labs as they were

14:07.080 --> 14:11.960
called at Barthie University, and we played too much X-Tank. Anyone know X-Tank? Yes,

14:11.960 --> 14:19.800
very good. Too much fun, and too many late nights. And that was the thing about coding

14:19.800 --> 14:24.080
at the time as well. It was a social enterprise. It's exactly the same these days as well.

14:24.080 --> 14:31.920
I look at my son. I say to him, okay, why have you not learned? Okay, so now he's going

14:31.920 --> 14:38.240
to university. He's starting to learn computer science at university. And when I was growing

14:38.240 --> 14:42.240
up, I had a computer. I probably liked some of you here. I started coding because I was

14:42.240 --> 14:45.680
interested in it. He was absolutely zero-interesting coding until he got to university. It's all

14:45.680 --> 14:49.520
been gaming. I've been like, well, why don't you build a website? I was like, no interest,

14:49.520 --> 14:55.120
but yet he goes on to study computer science. Annoyingly, he's really good at it, and he's

14:55.120 --> 14:59.560
picked it up in no time at all. So now I'm getting WhatsApp saying, Dad, what about this

14:59.560 --> 15:05.560
node problem? How do I fix that? Okay, fine. But to be honest, looking back, it's exactly

15:05.560 --> 15:11.160
the same now as it was then, because we just mucked around too. We spent a lot of time

15:11.160 --> 15:16.000
in the Spark Labs playing X-Tank. We spent a lot of time learning command line or learning

15:16.000 --> 15:22.440
about Unix processes, how they work. We learned stuff off each other. So at university, I

15:22.440 --> 15:28.640
learned Unix command lines solely from mucking around. I learned C and X11 from doing some

15:28.640 --> 15:35.640
university courses, some of my minors. But the majority of it was from, yeah, just hanging

15:35.640 --> 15:45.200
out with people, exchanging information. So that was Rose Garden 1. And then we left university.

15:45.200 --> 15:51.800
We went off into the working world as a peer group as well. So I ended up in London, eventually,

15:51.800 --> 15:57.280
as did Chris and Melissa. They were working for the same company, actually. And we ended

15:57.280 --> 16:05.000
up hanging out. And somehow, I don't know quite how this happened, but we got to a point

16:05.000 --> 16:13.560
where Linux was a thing. You know, I think I've got a picture next. Where is it? Okay.

16:13.560 --> 16:17.720
So I've been working for a little bit. I've just skipped ahead. I'll skip back. I've been

16:17.720 --> 16:21.000
working for a little bit. I managed to save a bit of money eventually, and I bought my

16:21.000 --> 16:27.960
first PC and it was one of these Gateway 2000s. Came in a cow box. I can't forget it. And

16:27.960 --> 16:31.320
it was so exciting because I just never had my own PC before. And the first thing I did

16:31.320 --> 16:42.840
with it was buy Slackware 3.0 and put that on it. And that came out of, yeah, workings.

16:42.840 --> 16:47.680
I'll go back to this picture. The working world. And that was really where things started

16:47.680 --> 16:54.200
to kind of fall into place. Because when you're working in a proper company, you have responsibilities.

16:54.200 --> 16:59.160
And that was the one thing that work really taught me. You're not just mucking around

16:59.160 --> 17:02.920
in the Spark Lab anymore. You're not kind of just stay up late to do your coding and

17:02.920 --> 17:07.000
have a lot of fun and then sleep late. You've got to, well, you end up doing that anyway

17:07.000 --> 17:11.200
when you're a young engineer sometimes. But if you're working for a company like this,

17:11.200 --> 17:17.640
like I was, a telecoms company, and we had responsibilities, so we created network management

17:17.640 --> 17:23.960
software and also software for multiplexers. And my first boss, she was great. She sent

17:23.960 --> 17:29.640
me out on a customer visit straight away. She said, okay, get in the car, go up to Sheffield

17:29.640 --> 17:35.240
in Yorkshire in the UK, and go and be on site with Yorkshire Telecom whilst they're upgrading

17:35.240 --> 17:39.040
their multiplexers and they're upgrading the software with our new network management

17:39.040 --> 17:45.200
software. And for something like that, as a young, just out of university graduate engineer,

17:45.200 --> 17:48.800
it was incredible because it finally gave you that connection between all the stuff that

17:48.800 --> 17:55.480
you do, all the hours that you spend on a piece of code and the customer themselves.

17:55.480 --> 17:59.960
Because if one of these cabinets fell out of the network or the upgrade didn't work,

17:59.960 --> 18:04.080
then some would have to be sent out in a van. So the street cabinet to reboot it and then

18:04.080 --> 18:08.480
you have to watch it in the control room to make sure it came back up again. And that

18:08.480 --> 18:18.400
was, yeah, the real kind of visceral connection. So this is the first you might call it a learning

18:18.400 --> 18:27.560
that I had. I didn't even realize it at the time, of course, you don't do. It was the

18:27.560 --> 18:32.440
fact that you need to serve somebody with everything you do. Well, I felt that anyway.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.440
Because sometimes you might just want to write some code for the hell of it, but unless someone

18:36.440 --> 18:49.440
is using it, where's the point? I felt that really, really keenly. So yeah, cow box. Actually,

18:49.440 --> 18:54.320
just to get back to the last one as well. So the cow box arrived. I got a P75, I think

18:54.320 --> 18:59.720
it was 95. So Pentium P75. It wasn't particularly flash. It wasn't top of the range, but I

18:59.720 --> 19:03.720
installed Slackware 3 on it. And then there was a tar ball of the Rose Garden source code

19:03.720 --> 19:08.080
knocking around. And I think Chris and myself knocked it together. It might have been Melissa

19:08.080 --> 19:15.680
as well, knocked it together into the first kind of release on Linux of Rose Garden. And

19:15.680 --> 19:32.760
then just after that, one second. So it was kind of the heyday of music software, really.

19:32.760 --> 19:37.040
Even got very exciting very quickly. So I bought my first PC. I was working. I was working

19:37.040 --> 19:43.520
too hard, but having fun. But after a while, hard work became too much like hard work.

19:43.520 --> 19:48.560
I was on pager duty and back in those days, it was actually a pager as well. And I remember

19:48.560 --> 19:52.360
the first night I was on pager duty. I was lying there in my bed and I put the pager

19:52.360 --> 19:56.480
right next to my head and I was just staring at it for the whole night. I couldn't go to

19:56.480 --> 20:00.840
sleep. I was just so scared in case it went off. What would I do? I had my own hardware

20:00.840 --> 20:09.200
at home. I had my PC. But it was, I'll come to this, it was on a 14.4 modem which I had

20:09.200 --> 20:13.480
to ask someone to buy for me at work. They wouldn't even, otherwise I'd have to drive

20:13.480 --> 20:16.400
into the office. I'd have to have a car. So it was basically, you were trying to offer

20:16.400 --> 20:22.720
support to a global product from a very basic setup whilst being on pager duty. And the

20:22.720 --> 20:26.120
pager duty lasted for a whole week as well. So you'd have a week on and then maybe two

20:26.120 --> 20:32.160
weeks off. And that was really stressful. So between that and working and everything

20:32.160 --> 20:36.200
else and probably parting a little bit too much, I just felt burnt out after a year and

20:36.200 --> 20:40.080
a half of this. So I kind of moved jobs a couple of times. I bumped up my pay a little

20:40.080 --> 20:44.280
bit and I got to a point a couple of years later where I could actually take some time

20:44.280 --> 20:49.320
off. So I thought, oh, God, let's relax. The first thing I did was buy some music software

20:49.320 --> 20:53.640
because it was the thing I wanted to do. So I've been building software and I've been

20:53.640 --> 20:56.840
getting into being an engineer. But what I really wanted to do was make some music and

20:56.840 --> 21:03.600
be a rock star. So seriously. So I bought a load, well, I say bought. I probably ripped.

21:03.600 --> 21:10.680
I definitely ripped a load of stuff and put it onto my Windows PC like Logic Audio, Cubase,

21:10.680 --> 21:15.080
Rebirth and Reason, all these great tools that were available at the time. Digital audio

21:15.080 --> 21:19.880
workstations, which meant they would record audio. You could put plugins into them. They

21:19.880 --> 21:28.840
would make great sounds and also things like Rebirth, which was like a TB808 simulator,

21:28.840 --> 21:36.160
emulator, whatever. Lots of fun. Lots of squelchy fun. So I spent a couple of years understanding

21:36.160 --> 21:44.480
these tools and having fun with them and recording. And what I didn't realize I was doing was

21:44.480 --> 21:50.800
I was learning the domain. And if you kind of look back from where we are now and you've

21:50.800 --> 21:56.880
kind of studied OO, object-oriented design, and you've maybe read Eric Evans' book or

21:56.880 --> 22:02.440
listened to Vaughan Vernon speak about DDD, domain driven design, you understand that

22:02.440 --> 22:06.280
that's what you're doing is you're learning the language, the ubiquitous language of music

22:06.280 --> 22:11.000
software and then you're learning to talk and feel the way that musicians do when they

22:11.000 --> 22:31.000
use this software. So around the same time, so around the same time, we had Rose Garden

22:31.000 --> 22:37.120
2.1 already, but we hadn't moved on since 1992. This was about 1998 at this point. We

22:37.120 --> 22:42.440
did kick around a few ideas. So mainly Chris and myself and also Guillaume, a French developer

22:42.440 --> 22:47.440
who came on board, I think off the back of the 2.1 work. Again, it was a bit hazy. We

22:47.440 --> 22:50.440
started kicking around some ideas. We want to rewrite this thing. How are we going to

22:50.440 --> 22:56.080
do it? So I got this domain knowledge. Chris was an amazing software engineer and still

22:56.080 --> 23:04.760
is to this day and still works in audio software. And me piggybacking on his genius and also

23:04.760 --> 23:09.760
Guillaume's genius was a way to understand how we could build a whole new version of

23:09.760 --> 23:16.720
Rose Garden because it was an itch we wanted to scratch. And we discussed a few things

23:16.720 --> 23:22.320
and technology was quite fluid at the time. So we were like, could we do it in Java? Not

23:22.320 --> 23:29.160
really. There was no sound system or there was a very basic API. To be fair, the Linux

23:29.160 --> 23:33.240
sound system was not particularly advanced at that time. I was just about coming out

23:33.240 --> 23:37.760
but it was mainly OSS before that. So Rose Garden 2.1 just used open sound system, which

23:37.760 --> 23:42.280
was just a device, essentially. So you could, there was no internal routing of media events

23:42.280 --> 23:47.800
or audio. It was all straight out onto the device. Java had the same problem. It was

23:47.800 --> 23:51.480
kind of slow in catching up. It wasn't slow. It was just the fact that it hadn't been written

23:51.480 --> 23:58.480
yet. A lot of these interfaces, there was, I think, a media API for Java, but Java was

23:58.480 --> 24:04.640
never my forte. Didn't like it. Didn't like the stack traces. We also discussed IPC quite

24:04.640 --> 24:12.120
a lot with interfaces communication. We discussed Cobra. Anyone remember Cobra? Yeah. Anyone

24:12.120 --> 24:17.400
forgot Cobra? Yeah. Terrible. Well, the time was very exciting. There was that alien book.

24:17.400 --> 24:22.600
You read it and you thought, what the hell is this? It was really complicated. So it

24:22.600 --> 24:26.000
was too heavyweight. But I think actually Rose Garden 3, the missing number between

24:26.000 --> 24:33.000
1, 2, and where we are now with Rose Garden 4 was kind of IPC, a Cobra-based thing. We

24:33.000 --> 24:36.040
might have even written in Java or something. It was crazy. Anyway, that didn't last very

24:36.040 --> 24:42.720
long. It was back of a fag packet type stuff, as they say in the UK. But we had a few other

24:42.720 --> 24:46.880
ideas. And we thought, well, it wants to be, we want to build it on Linux. It has to be

24:46.880 --> 24:52.680
on Linux. We're both quite pretty proficient in C++. Let's do C++ maybe. Let's build a

24:52.680 --> 24:59.000
nice data model. And also, we saw that Elsa was emergent. Jack, which is the Jack Audio

24:59.000 --> 25:04.280
Connection Kit, is still, I don't think it was invented until a couple years later, until

25:04.280 --> 25:10.600
maybe 2000 or so. But that was also a flexible audio routing system, which is very cool.

25:10.600 --> 25:15.880
And we eventually implemented. But we knew another thing, that the UI was going to be

25:15.880 --> 25:25.400
vital. Having worked on X11 and a thing of a very basic X11 widget set, there were two

25:25.400 --> 25:31.400
very exciting Linux alternatives coming up, JTK and all the various wizards, all the various

25:31.400 --> 25:38.720
parts of it. And KDE based on QT. And the debate probably didn't take that long, but it felt

25:38.720 --> 25:47.240
like it went on forever. But eventually, we decided, I think, as a kind of a three of

25:47.240 --> 25:52.240
us, on taking the most pragmatic attitude, and that was, we're going to go with KDE.

25:52.240 --> 25:59.480
And initially, we decided to go with KDE because it seemed to be slightly more mature. And

25:59.480 --> 26:05.200
I think we all like QT as well. We didn't know QT particularly well at that point. The toolkit

26:05.200 --> 26:20.960
that KDE is built on. So we come to the KDE years. So this was the real start of the

26:20.960 --> 26:26.040
real build of Rose Garden 4, the thing I showed you at the top. So we finally got here. From

26:26.040 --> 26:32.440
what I say here, KDE 3 was released in April 3, 2002. And I think what we'd done between

26:32.440 --> 26:37.000
then is we'd started probably in 2000, and we'd started writing some stuff. And eventually,

26:37.000 --> 26:41.080
we got to a point where we had to kind of go with the major upgrades. And KDE 3 felt,

26:41.080 --> 26:43.840
for the first time, I think, when we were finally kind of getting there. It felt like

26:43.840 --> 26:52.320
it was good. We were using a little bit of, have you ever seen that picture? Yeah, I'll

26:52.320 --> 26:57.160
just stick on here. So we were using a little bit of de-cop, I think it was, which was the

26:57.160 --> 27:05.040
communication interface for Rose Garden. We were running two separate processes, the Rose

27:05.040 --> 27:13.520
Garden sequencer and the Rose Garden itself, Rose Garden GUI, basically. And they communicated

27:13.520 --> 27:18.400
via, well, we were going to use the KDE mechanism. We didn't in the end. I think eventually,

27:18.400 --> 27:24.640
we ended up on a memory map file, which was suitably good for both processes to access

27:24.640 --> 27:30.680
at that time. So yeah, as you've seen, we ended up with a quite a flexible architecture.

27:30.680 --> 27:35.240
So this kind of maps the core. I'm not going to go into the core of the core of Rose Garden,

27:35.240 --> 27:39.280
but I can point out a few things. So there was the two processes, which underlaid it

27:39.280 --> 27:46.840
behind. The GUI communicated with the shared memory map file. The sequencer did actually

27:46.840 --> 27:51.040
all the running of the stuff, the in and the out and the whatever. It was all controlled

27:51.040 --> 27:57.880
via the transport down here. And it had quite a flexible mapping, so that we had the, any

27:57.880 --> 28:01.840
instrument here could be mapped to any of these instruments there. And they could be

28:01.840 --> 28:06.800
a MIDI device or an audio device. And we kind of created an abstraction layer there, which

28:06.800 --> 28:15.280
would allow us to map those as well onto either MIDI devices, which users could create called

28:15.280 --> 28:23.440
device files, which allowed our users to actually get involved with creating specific configurations

28:23.440 --> 28:29.000
for their own setups. So if you had a particular type of keyboard or a MIDI device somewhere

28:29.000 --> 28:34.120
else, then you'd be able to create a device for it and be able to map those sounds to

28:34.120 --> 28:41.760
your Rose Garden setup. Similarly, the segments themselves. So these blobs are all segments

28:41.760 --> 28:45.080
and you could slice those up and they don't have parameters associated with them too.

28:45.080 --> 28:51.400
So there was design obviously going on underneath the covers. And that was from quite an early,

28:51.400 --> 28:59.000
quite an early time as well. I believe that we didn't actively sit down and plan it all,

28:59.000 --> 29:02.800
but we spent a lot of time refactoring. And that was one of the biggest pain points I

29:02.800 --> 29:08.280
think we felt whilst we were working in the early 2000s, was there was all these great

29:08.280 --> 29:15.640
tools available. Coming out of working in industry where you had all the compilers essentially

29:15.640 --> 29:19.760
before then, the end of the 90s or mid to end of the 90s, it was typically you'd have

29:19.760 --> 29:24.680
to buy a compiler. So you had to buy a license for something. You'd have to buy your library.

29:24.680 --> 29:29.000
So the standard template library for C++ wasn't, it was still kind of getting there. You'd

29:29.000 --> 29:32.480
have to buy boost. I think it was or whatever it was called. There were the various things

29:32.480 --> 29:40.520
you had to pay for. GCC and G++ were still getting there as well. G++3 I think came out

29:40.520 --> 29:48.800
around the same time. So the tool set was shifting. There was also the shifting media

29:48.800 --> 29:56.120
layers as well in Linux. So we were talking to people on various main lists basically

29:56.120 --> 29:59.280
about like when is the new version of ALSA coming out? Were the stuff that we can use

29:59.280 --> 30:03.280
to actually get some real-time stuff working on ALSA? So all of these layers underneath

30:03.280 --> 30:08.560
we were waiting for. Plus the tooling was a little bit kind of getting there too. Plus

30:08.560 --> 30:14.360
all of the UI toolkits were also growing. So we were kind of growing alongside all of

30:14.360 --> 30:19.760
this stuff and it made it quite difficult. We didn't have any CI. We had like a couple

30:19.760 --> 30:25.840
of machines. We had some basic source control in Sourceforge which was probably CVS at the

30:25.840 --> 30:30.880
time, not even Subversion at that point, which worked. But typically even with three of us

30:30.880 --> 30:35.280
working on it, there would be breaking changes the whole time. We didn't have any tests per

30:35.280 --> 30:39.400
say. We'd just be downloading the latest bit of source code and building it at some

30:39.400 --> 30:46.960
break. So when you're refactoring our core area, even with three people and you've got

30:46.960 --> 30:52.080
all of these dependencies moving, it makes it very difficult to get anywhere. So we struggled

30:52.080 --> 30:57.040
to be fair. I was working for a couple of years. Well, it probably felt like a couple

30:57.040 --> 30:59.840
of years. It probably wasn't. It was probably more like six months. I did take some time

30:59.840 --> 31:04.080
off and I worked on it full-time in a little basement with multiple computers, with this

31:04.080 --> 31:08.560
CC running on various computers to try and speed up my builds and stuff. And it was a

31:08.560 --> 31:13.880
real struggle, mainly because we were refactoring and breaking stuff, but also because we had

31:13.880 --> 31:22.200
a kind of an unstable base. Still, through much effort and through much time and through

31:22.200 --> 31:28.680
much dedication from not just a core team, a growing team the whole time, but also some

31:28.680 --> 31:32.760
really passionate users who came along quite early and have stuck with us the whole way

31:32.760 --> 31:36.840
through. So we've still got people who have been using it for 20 years who just love it

31:36.840 --> 31:41.760
because they can't think of any other way of working with it, basically. It's brilliant.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.920
They'll compile it and they'll run it on their own kernels, or they'll download it as part

31:44.920 --> 31:48.440
of a package, or they'll have a machine which they haven't touched for years purely because

31:48.440 --> 31:54.240
they want to run Rose Garden. There are other alternatives. Of course, there's plenty of

31:54.240 --> 31:59.000
other alternatives, but what we've done is we kind of found our people, I suppose, through

31:59.000 --> 32:04.080
the way that we'd built it, through the way that we'd gone about building it, maybe,

32:04.080 --> 32:08.480
as well. The thought we put into it and the love, maybe, we've kind of built something

32:08.480 --> 32:13.480
which is stuck around. And as you can see here, it does, this is it doing some audio

32:13.480 --> 32:18.600
and it also plugs into this thing I mentioned called the Jack Audio Connection Kit, which

32:18.600 --> 32:23.520
is a way of routing audio around internally on Linux and various other platforms, too.

32:23.520 --> 32:29.480
So it's actually like an audio bus. Here's a virtual synth as well, which you can route

32:29.480 --> 32:45.680
to it. So it works with virtual synths, external synths, et cetera. So what we saw was an emergent

32:45.680 --> 32:50.360
architecture. As I mentioned, various things. I need to speed up a bit, so I'm going to

32:50.360 --> 32:54.360
go through a little bit faster. I've also mentioned the Rose Garden Studio Concept. So this was

32:54.360 --> 33:00.720
the thing about the device files. And I think this is another powerful feature of Rose Garden,

33:00.720 --> 33:03.800
one that's still used to this day. So we've got over 100 device files, so people have

33:03.800 --> 33:08.520
gone off and they built them for, I don't know, Yamaha synths, for Roland synths for

33:08.520 --> 33:11.240
various different types. And you can just download those and install them into Rose

33:11.240 --> 33:17.080
Garden. And you can map all the set, all the voices basically straight into it. Additionally,

33:17.080 --> 33:23.880
we've got the, as I mentioned, the Jack integration, the support for Ladsper and also DSSI plug-ins,

33:23.880 --> 33:29.760
which are native plug-ins for Linux and other platforms, as well as the VST plug-ins, which

33:29.760 --> 33:38.480
are the standard music, more standardized music plug-ins, audio plug-ins for Windows

33:38.480 --> 33:43.480
and other platforms. Additionally, of course, notation markup and printing using Lilypond

33:43.480 --> 33:50.240
as well. So a very high quality score export from Rose Garden, which has been very much

33:50.240 --> 33:59.200
appreciated by some of our users, too. So with all that rambling, this is one of the

33:59.200 --> 34:04.400
learnings that I found, was that just the architecture itself is difficult because of

34:04.400 --> 34:09.240
various reasons, communication, mainly, but also what do we want to build? Secondly, organization

34:09.240 --> 34:12.080
around that is difficult, too. And we saw that with the refactoring, that we had to

34:12.080 --> 34:17.560
suffer, essentially. Maybe with better tooling or maybe with more stable platforms that we

34:17.560 --> 34:22.680
were building on, it would have been simpler. And in hindsight, it seems almost, yeah, trivial,

34:22.680 --> 34:32.880
but at the time, it felt very difficult. Secondly, this is something which really stuck

34:32.880 --> 34:39.440
a lot in the claw, in the throat, which is everyone has an opinion on UI, everyone. Users,

34:39.440 --> 34:45.120
developers, even developers who don't profess to be UI or UX experts have an opinion because

34:45.120 --> 34:51.320
we all use the software, right? And if you change anything, then you break a workflow.

34:51.320 --> 34:55.720
And that's a difficult lesson to learn. You may be a great coder, but again, it becomes

34:55.720 --> 35:02.240
the social angle between what are we trying to build and how do we keep people happy?

35:02.240 --> 35:05.440
Because you could, and it's even happened on the Rose Garden developer list in the last

35:05.440 --> 35:13.360
couple of days. Ted's released a new version before Christmas, but he's released a patch

35:13.360 --> 35:17.600
version in the last week, and he changed one of the theme setups, so it defaults to something

35:17.600 --> 35:23.840
that no one likes. So there's a little mini uproar going on.

35:23.840 --> 35:29.560
On the flip side, when you do get it right, when you do spend the time getting your architecture

35:29.560 --> 35:35.480
right and you're thinking about your code and your core, then sometimes big features

35:35.480 --> 35:40.320
that you might have thought impossible even a few months ago are almost trivial to implement.

35:40.320 --> 35:44.520
But suddenly, those points, you go, oh, thank God, we got it right, and you actually feel

35:44.520 --> 35:48.920
that that is something that was worth spending the time on. It doesn't happen all the time,

35:48.920 --> 35:57.080
but sometimes it does, and it feels great. And yeah, fourthly, in this little block,

35:57.080 --> 36:00.400
literally all you need is a small number of users, and there needs to be loyal users

36:00.400 --> 36:05.800
to keep you going. So even though you're not getting paid for it, if you've got passionate

36:05.800 --> 36:13.280
users, it can mean everything. Okay. Talking of passionate users, we'd spend

36:13.280 --> 36:19.480
some time in basements and online, of course, building stuff, and we thought, we and Chris

36:19.480 --> 36:23.480
thought it would be a great idea to get out there and start showing it. And around the

36:23.480 --> 36:29.720
same time, 2002 or so, there were Linux expo starting to happen in the UK. So through contacts

36:29.720 --> 36:34.520
of ours, we were involved with Linux user magazine. I wrote for them at some point

36:34.520 --> 36:40.000
together, and we managed to flag a stand at one of the first Linux expos, and this is

36:40.000 --> 36:46.680
us looking all ruddy and young and lovely and wearing branded t-shirts. Look at that.

36:46.680 --> 36:50.720
Made that myself. Fantastic. This is my friend Mike, unfortunately, not with us anymore,

36:50.720 --> 36:55.600
but he was a great inspiration and helped us a lot and encouraged us to get set up.

36:55.600 --> 37:02.880
And this is Chris. And this is our fantastic set up, isn't that? Just stellar. But today,

37:02.880 --> 37:09.000
and yesterday, walking around, looking at people sitting behind desks, exactly, not

37:09.000 --> 37:14.120
better, better desks, to be honest, with much more impressive set ups, it really takes me

37:14.120 --> 37:17.760
back to those days when we were doing the same thing. We had our software, we were excited

37:17.760 --> 37:25.040
about it, and we went out there and showed it to people. So, yeah, we were doing lots

37:25.040 --> 37:29.720
of things, writing, went to trade shows, went to conferences. Well, yeah, not hundreds

37:29.720 --> 37:35.880
of them, a few, a handful. We started approaching vendors, so there were people who were building

37:35.880 --> 37:41.480
music, software, PCs, and we talked to them. Maybe they'd be interested. We talked to Roland.

37:41.480 --> 37:47.120
We talked to Yamaha. We talked to loads of people. We talked to AMD. There's a book.

37:47.120 --> 37:55.280
It's in my bag. There's the one second. So, Michael McIntyre wrote this whole guide, which

37:55.280 --> 38:01.760
was published, The Rose Garden Companion. Yeah, and then we started talking to partners

38:01.760 --> 38:08.400
as well. So, there were people at the same time who were betting their careers and their

38:08.400 --> 38:14.080
livelihoods on Linux being the next big platform. Obviously, everyone thinks this year is the

38:14.080 --> 38:21.320
year of the Linux desktop. But there were still people out there, well, then there were people

38:21.320 --> 38:28.000
out there who wanted to build Linux-based hardware as well. We talked to a creator of

38:28.000 --> 38:32.520
keyboards in Italy. We flew us over, and we talked to him. It was a fantastic couple

38:32.520 --> 38:36.720
of days. We met his family, his mother made us lovely pasta for lunch, and we saw his

38:36.720 --> 38:44.000
workshop where he was building these incredible multimedia platforms and keyboards in his

38:44.000 --> 38:52.760
garage, basically, his garage business. Fantastic. So, yeah, we got out on the road. Also, we

38:52.760 --> 38:57.280
launched a product. This was called Studio to Go. So, Chris and I, we formed a company

38:57.280 --> 39:03.800
and we built a bootable CD, which enables you to basically have an entire studio on

39:03.800 --> 39:07.360
your CD. You could put it into a Windows machine, and you could boot it up and boot it into

39:07.360 --> 39:11.320
Linux, and you'd be ready to go, basically. You could also install it on your Windows

39:11.320 --> 39:18.840
machine, too. This is Chris, the year later. So, from the previous photo, this is a kind

39:18.840 --> 39:25.120
of a level of professionalism hire. We look more relaxed, more kind of in the moment.

39:25.120 --> 39:29.520
Yeah, again, I think more relaxed. And then if we look another year further, this is us,

39:29.520 --> 39:35.560
the kind of the high point of our career with Fervent Software and Studio to Go. This was

39:35.560 --> 39:45.520
at the Sounds Expo in 2004, I believe, yeah. So, we weren't in this by ourselves. There

39:45.520 --> 39:54.000
was an organisation called Linux Audio, as well, which is still around, and in fact,

39:54.000 --> 39:57.840
I looked on the website yesterday, and apparently I'm on the board of directors or something

39:57.840 --> 40:01.480
for, anyway, it's not a company, and I'm not on the board of anything there, but it

40:01.480 --> 40:07.080
was like a kind of an open source collaboration group with a guy called Daniel James, as well,

40:07.080 --> 40:18.560
who also I work with in journalism. He was a big proponent of another Linux audio platform,

40:18.560 --> 40:23.440
which is still being sold, I believe. So, working together, we managed to get to a Sounds

40:23.440 --> 40:28.840
Expo where it was not just Linux stuff, it was also Windows and the rest of the event

40:28.840 --> 40:38.480
is there, too. However, at that point, it was getting clear that we weren't going to

40:38.480 --> 40:42.080
make a living out of it, Chris and I. So, we kind of, with a family coming along, and

40:42.080 --> 40:45.120
that's why I mentioned it at the beginning with a photo of my son, it was like a decision

40:45.120 --> 40:48.680
to say, well, what can we do now? Because we tried a kind of business, didn't make enough

40:48.680 --> 40:52.360
money for us, and we didn't really have the insight into what we should do next. So, we

40:52.360 --> 40:56.880
just said, okay, let's call it quits for the minute. I dropped off from Rose Garden at

40:56.880 --> 41:02.680
that point, but loads of people stepped up. One of the biggest things that they did in

41:02.680 --> 41:09.760
the next section, which is the QT years, was to port it from KDE to QT, which meant basically

41:09.760 --> 41:15.840
ripping out the KDE stuff. Sounds simple enough, but took about a year and a half, which led

41:15.840 --> 41:21.360
everyone to understand that major dependency upgrades are very hard.

41:21.360 --> 41:24.960
One of the good things to look at from the source code of Rose Garden now is that of

41:24.960 --> 41:30.520
the source files that we have, about 1400 C++ files, most of them are pretty small.

41:30.520 --> 41:39.840
So, under 500 lines, that's including comments. So, that's a good sign to healthy code base.

41:39.840 --> 41:47.600
So, I'm skipping now from 2008, 2010, and I'm kind of looking towards what's happened

41:47.600 --> 41:52.560
in the last 10 years, but also the future. So, Ted Felix came on board in 2010, and by

41:52.560 --> 41:56.720
his words, I spoke to him in the last week or two, by his words, he said it suffered

41:56.720 --> 42:00.960
from a lot of stability problems. So, this is, we have a GitHub as well, as well as a

42:00.960 --> 42:08.440
source for, and GitHub is downstream, so it allows us to do some nice visualizations.

42:08.440 --> 42:16.040
So this was around the first bit of work that we did to stabilize the initial Rose Garden.

42:16.040 --> 42:22.480
This was around the studio to go time, lots of work there, and then this was around the

42:22.480 --> 42:27.920
KDE to QT port, so lots of work went in there, too. After this, when Ted came on board,

42:27.920 --> 42:31.400
he said basically he spent a lot of time stabilizing, basically getting rid of bugs and making sure

42:31.400 --> 42:35.480
that there was adequate performance, and doing that, I think, I don't know, it was not unaided

42:35.480 --> 42:43.320
for sure, but focusing on that a lot. And you can see this also represented in the way

42:43.320 --> 42:49.160
that Chris and Gio were very involved here, and Ted was involved later, and this is my

42:49.160 --> 42:58.320
contribution. And also, we see, again, from GitHub, the churn that was going on around

42:58.320 --> 43:03.160
the same time, so studio to go product, QT port, and then stabilization after that.

43:03.160 --> 43:11.700
But if you then look at, I'm just comparing us to Musa, which is another Linux audio work

43:11.700 --> 43:18.480
station as well, and this goes up to 40 on this axis and up to a bit higher on this one.

43:18.480 --> 43:24.000
So in terms of contributions, we're not far off what Musa is doing as well, which is really

43:24.000 --> 43:28.960
encouraging to see. So I would say the product is pretty healthy, it's been stabilized, it's

43:28.960 --> 43:34.960
still being used by lots of people, you don't hear about it a lot, but it's still there.

43:34.960 --> 43:41.120
And I'm going a bit faster now because I need to wrap up, but the number one thing has got

43:41.120 --> 43:48.040
to be people, and that's what I mentioned at the front of this talk. People to do the

43:48.040 --> 43:51.880
work, of course, people to support you whilst you're doing the work, and the expertise that

43:51.880 --> 43:56.920
you build together when you're designing something. So that's why I see Rose Garden

43:56.920 --> 44:03.840
now is still surviving, and still something that we can contribute to.

44:03.840 --> 44:13.720
So top five things. For open source, basically, I would say this as well. So good architecture

44:13.720 --> 44:20.880
and good toolkit choices are super important, and they help with defining your quality and

44:20.880 --> 44:24.960
defining how far you can go with any one thing. And if you're not getting anywhere down a

44:24.960 --> 44:28.960
certain path, then just rip it up and start again, or refactor, or think really hard about

44:28.960 --> 44:35.120
your design. Also, Ted's jumped in with some stuff here. As he's mentioned that stringent

44:35.120 --> 44:40.000
requirements are merging, so making sure that you don't allow anything to merge, and in

44:40.000 --> 44:43.400
fact, recently there's been a fork of Rose Garden because one of the developers has got

44:43.400 --> 44:46.440
a bit annoyed that he's not getting his stuff reviewed, and it's fair enough, everyone's

44:46.440 --> 44:49.480
doing it in their spare time. It's still a labor of love.

44:49.480 --> 44:56.760
Also, I mentioned earlier, refactoring and unit testing, and I did actually run the unit

44:56.760 --> 45:04.400
test code coverage, the other day on Rose Garden, and it's 8%, which is not good. Okay, there

45:04.400 --> 45:09.360
are some challenges with a UI-based, whether with a GUI, but it should be higher than that.

45:09.360 --> 45:13.600
So I imagine one of the things that I might be looking at as I dip my toe back in a little

45:13.600 --> 45:20.800
bit is to maybe write some more tests. So number one, quality. Number two, coding is

45:20.800 --> 45:24.200
social. I mean, that's one of the things that we don't realise is that we think we're going

45:24.200 --> 45:28.880
to OSS, we can just hide maybe online or do some coding by ourselves, but increasingly

45:28.880 --> 45:33.960
it becomes social. It's a different type of sociability maybe to working in an office.

45:33.960 --> 45:38.480
But open source, I believe, is much more social than working in office because working in an

45:38.480 --> 45:44.000
engineering job or software job in an office because you can just focus in on the one

45:44.000 --> 45:48.440
thing that you're doing. You don't have to be maybe told that you need to be more interactive

45:48.440 --> 45:52.800
in a certain way of working, but in OSS, you have to be. There is no question about it.

45:52.800 --> 46:01.840
You've got to be able to defend your ideas and maybe persuade other people to. Also,

46:01.840 --> 46:08.360
related to this as well, it's the social side of the customer engagement. It's the fact

46:08.360 --> 46:13.480
that you do have customers or end users, however you define them, and they will have opinions,

46:13.480 --> 46:17.040
whether you like it or not. So you're putting yourself out there.

46:17.040 --> 46:22.720
Thirdly, and this is something I've come across in the last year or so, this guy called Seth

46:22.720 --> 46:30.080
Godin. He's an American marketing guru and his approach, I really like his approach,

46:30.080 --> 46:39.520
he's got a great podcast called a Kimbo, A-K-I-M-B-O, you should check it out. He writes and he

46:39.520 --> 46:45.160
speaks really well, really pithily on lots of subjects about marketing and he's not like

46:45.160 --> 46:50.280
a slimy kind of marketing dude, whatever kind of feel. It speaks to me as an open source

46:50.280 --> 46:55.680
person. One of the things, one of his key phrases is this, people like us do things

46:55.680 --> 47:00.000
like this and I think that's what it means to connect with your audience, to find your

47:00.000 --> 47:06.400
audience and to keep connecting with your audience at the right level. So yeah, we might spend

47:06.400 --> 47:13.200
some time arguing about how a UI should be or how we should architect this or if we should

47:13.200 --> 47:18.000
reflect on that. However, it's worth it if we connect with each other and we connect

47:18.000 --> 47:24.080
with our customers well at the same time. And also, he talks about audience, importantly,

47:24.080 --> 47:28.440
because you don't need to solve all the problems in the world, all you need to do is solve

47:28.440 --> 47:37.240
a few problems for a few people. Fourthly, use all the tools, so we are just so lucky

47:37.240 --> 47:42.560
these days, we've got all these amazing tools, we've got GitHub, we've got Co-Curve, we've

47:42.560 --> 47:49.480
got Cloud, whatever it is, lots of stuff, you know, Sonar Cloud, etc., all these great

47:49.480 --> 47:57.720
things that we can use, Sonar type. So use them. Use CI, use unit testing, use TDD,

47:57.720 --> 48:01.040
use all of the great engineering advances that we've come up with over the last ten

48:01.040 --> 48:11.440
years to make our code better. And finally, don't take it too seriously. One of the reasons

48:11.440 --> 48:16.160
that I got involved in OSS was that I could do it from, well, we could do it ourselves,

48:16.160 --> 48:20.720
you know, we could put our little imprint on the world or do something fun. And that's

48:20.720 --> 48:25.320
the point, it needs to be fun, it needs to be enjoyable. So when it stops being enjoyable,

48:25.320 --> 48:44.040
don't do it anymore. And that is it. Thank you very much. Any questions?

48:44.040 --> 49:06.320
Are there any questions? Oh, yes, there are. Please raise your hand. Okay.

49:06.320 --> 49:15.040
Hi, thank you. I can't wait to give the software a try when I get back home. I might install

49:15.040 --> 49:23.920
it later. But was there any possibility of you like playing a bit of music, maybe? No

49:23.920 --> 49:37.560
demo today, I should have said that at the top. Thank you. Any other questions? Okay,

49:37.560 --> 49:55.000
thank you very much. A big round of applause.
