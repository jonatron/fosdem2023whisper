In this talk, the speaker discusses code reloading techniques in Python. They provide an overview of different techniques for reloading code and explore the inner workings of these techniques. They explain the concepts of cold code reloading, where the entire program is stopped and restarted, and hot code reloading, where the code is replaced in memory without stopping the program. The speaker explores how web frameworks like Django and Flask implement code reloading and how libraries like Watchdog and PyNotify can be used to watch for file system events. They also cover the challenges of hot code reloading, such as finding and loading the new code and replacing references to the old code. The speaker demonstrates two methods for hot code reloading in Python: using the importlib.reload() method and using the exec() function. They also mention the reloader library, which provides a decorator for automatic code reloading. Overall, the talk provides an in-depth look at code reloading techniques in Python and offers insights into their use and limitations.
