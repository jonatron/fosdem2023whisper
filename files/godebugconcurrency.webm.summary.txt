The speaker discusses the challenges of debugging concurrent programs in Go, which can have unpredictable behavior and output. They offer several approaches to debugging, including using debugger tools like Delve and GDB, setting breakpoints, using trace, and setting labels for better goroutine management. The speaker also recommends using the "go race" flag to detect data races and avoiding assuming a particular order of execution and designing concurrency separate from logic. They also offer references for further reading. The talk ends with an offer to donate to Ukraine and a Q&A session.
