{"text": " Hello, hi everyone. Thanks for joining us today. My name is Amita Sharma and I have Justin Florey with me. And today we will be speaking on a topic, evolution of women contribution in distro and force. And we will try to map it with the changes in the technology from on prem to cloud to edge. So this will be our agenda today. We will give a brief introduction about ourselves. We will try to look at the past, like 10 years or a decade, how the women stand in the technology in the open source world. What is the present look like for the women in the open source world and in the tech industry? And how the future will be? What are the parameters which has impacted in the past? What is the factors which are influencing today? And what we can do to make tomorrow better for the women? So with that, I am Amita Sharma. As I just mentioned, I am from India, Pune location. And I am working in Red Hat. I have a little bit more than of 17 years of experience and 12 years at Red Hat. I started contributing in Fedora since last 8 years. And I started with Fedora quality engineering testing. And then I started contributing in the diversity team of Fedora. I also served as a diversity advisor while contributing in Fedora. But in last few years, I faced some personal issues. And that's why I had to step back a little bit. But now I am coming back again with the help of my friends. And Justin is one of them. That is not so quick introduction about me. I would request Justin too. Hi, my name is Justin. In addition to being one of your dev room co-wranglers today, I have also been in the Fedora community for also about 8 years. Currently I am at Red Hat as the Fedora community architect where I joined pretty recently in October. So long time in Fedora, new to Red Hat. But in addition to all these things I am doing in my day job and things I did in Fedora in the past, I also worked together with Amita and even I think a couple of folks who might be in this room now too, to co-found our, at the time, it was our diversity team, now diversity, equity and inclusion team in 2015. And we've had kind of a very interesting journey over the last 8 years as we've tried to think around how we can make our community more inclusive and welcoming for people across all kinds of different backgrounds. So that's a little bit about us. But let's go ahead and before we get into the past, present, future, some questions to help frame our conversation for today. Yeah. So as we go into the presentation, I would request all of you to think about these questions and answers. I'm sure these answers are not binary in a yes or no, but it can give you a trigger in mind to think a little bit about the women contribution in the open source and overall in the tech industry. So with the hope, you will leave this talk with some deeper insight, how you might answer these questions in your own communities. I would like to go through these questions. When technology is advancing rapidly, we all know that how technology is moving, the data is coming out of the data centers and on prem to cloud and making its way to the edge even the autonomous technology. Do we think that even women is also advancing in their career and in the tech industry and in open source and in distros along with this technology, how rapidly these technology are advancing? Over the time, what are those critical factors that has influenced or impacted the women growth overall? What should we stop, start and continue doing to influence the women growth and women's contribution in the open source? How can we together build a cohesive environment for the women to contribute to support and to grow so that they can also reach to their sky when even data has come out of the data centers? So with that thought, let's look at the past. When I say at the past, I'm talking about last two decades, like 20 years, where how the women contributed or where she stood in the open source communities or in the tech industry. What were those challenges which has impacted her contribution and her ratio as compared to other genders in these communities? So we all know, maybe we can ask this question to ourselves that when you think about of Tiffin making or doing the laundry or taking care of the kids at the home, who comes in our mind? A mother, a female figure, right? So by default, it is socially customized thought or socially, you know, all over accepted thought that female is the primary caretaker at the home and not the men. So open source communities or the contribution to the distros as well, it is something we do out of our job or along with our job. This is where men can sink in their time easily, because they are not, they are not the birth giver. They are not the primary caretaker at the home. They don't have that primary responsibilities at the home. So with that social obligation of taking care of everything at home while also doing their job, it is little bit difficult to expect during that era from women to also contribute in the open source world. So balancing between all of these duties was little difficult at that point of time. Another factor which has influenced women contribution in the open source world is going away from the home. I'm not too sure about other countries, but in India from where I'm coming and mostly the APAC countries, if it's not so easy for the women to step out of the home. I still remember my father told me that you will only do your engineering if you will get an admission to a college which is nearby to home. If you can commute daily to that college, then only you are going to join and do your engineering. Otherwise you can take any other random course or the clothes stitching course and still survive. But we will not send you away from the home and I don't blame him and this is probably most with most of the female child at that point of the time. I'm talking about like 20 years back then and I don't blame him because the conditions and the situation was like that only. If you look at the crime rate in India for the women crime rate, the rapes, the human trafficking, prostitution and whatnot, they were very, very high. I'm not saying that they don't exist now. They still are there but the awareness, the advancement of technologies like mobile phone and all of that, the education really helped to overcome all of those insecurities and now parents are much more confident to send away their female child. I'm standing here out of my country so you can say that now things are much, much, much more better. But back during that time it was really difficult. So if the women and female could not step out of the home, the opportunities for them to take the better education, to take up the career and the job they would like to do, that was really very limited scope and packet at that time. Another factor which influenced the number or the ratio of the women in the open source was the biased growth opportunities and I'm not saying it, the numbers all over says that. If you look at the numbers, the leadership positions, the CEO, CTOs and even the staff or the council members, they are maximum 99% are male and not the female and that's exactly why because of this is sort of a boys club, they hire more and more boys and men rather than women and this all starts from the beginning. Like if you look at the schools, look at the technical colleges, the engineering colleges even around you, women are less in number there as well. So that's why they are less in the technical industry, they are less in the open source communities and the distros as well. So that is why the numbers are uneven. With that, that was about the past and the reasons why women were not that much seen around these open source communities and distros, maybe now the time to look at what does the picture look like at the present and for that I would request Justin to help us. So we'll take a quick look at some, especially in the distro space, some of the things of where we are today. There's a number of things up here that you can also kind of dig into but I'd like to highlight a couple of these. One of these is actually the emergence of DEI communities in distro space. Like I mentioned earlier, the Fedora diversity DEI team launched in 2015 and one of our biggest things that we were working on at the time was looking at pre-COVID was a lot of our event guidelines and looking at things like our annual conference and local release parties that we would do in countries all over the world. Things that we could do to help support our community, to open up and try to identify gaps that might make it harder for people who have different, are coming from different places to contribute and be a part in our community. Some specific examples as well. There's also Arch Linux women which that community has been around also for I think probably like eight, ten years as well. There's Ubuntu women which also has kind of had parts of like more active growth at times as well and I'd like to say like there's also two kinds of communities that have kind of emerged here. I'd say there's more like social communities where people can connect and share experiences and identify with other people who are like themselves as well as more functional teams like the Fedora DEI team where we're working with project leadership and providing advice and insight to our project for how we can make these steps. Another one I think that's very relevant in recent times is the flexible working style, especially after COVID this whole shift to remote hybrid work has opened up more opportunities for people to work in the way that works best for their lifestyle. Whether that means spending some time at home, commuting into an office or being fully remote, there's more of these opportunities now to choose a working style that's flexible and fits different kinds of lifestyles and this traditional one of you're always in an office nine to five Monday to Friday kind of structure. Additionally one that's I think also very important now as well is the support and mentoring which has been really critical for bringing more people into the fold, really emphasizing this person-to-person connection. I mean even for me I can think of people who have helped mentor me and guide me in the distro community space and I think that's really important for everyone to have, someone who they can relate to and help give them not just visibility but help give them advice on how they can grow and support their career or contributions in a community like a Linux distribution. One specific data point for this is the Outreachy Internship Program which many of our distributions participate in this program for quite some time even going back to when it was the GNOME program for women. Outreachy's celebrating over a thousand internships this year which is like really exciting but I think really underscores this whole thing that mentorship is a really important part of how we've gotten to where we are today. But with that I want to also look ahead into the future a little bit and Mita and I will split this one up a little bit to think around how we can continue breaking down these barriers going forward into the future. But first before we can really look ahead to the future I think we also have to acknowledge the fact that there's still a long way to go there's still a lot of the same challenges that we were working with 10 or 20 years ago that are still present either in the same way or maybe a different form today. So we're still far away from being this total ideal equality equity place and this will help change the overall mindset if we can at least acknowledge the problem and show us that we can start to take steps to resolve it. One thing I'll mention here as a data point which is you know we do what we do a lot in Fedora I feel like I'm really proud of the work that we've done in our DEI team but also if I look at our Fedora Council the the role that I just joined the three roles who are part of the top level of the Fedora leadership are all three white men from North America which I think kind of does underscore the point that you know there's still there's room to grow in these leadership opportunities although I will also say our Fedora Council better reflect some of that diversity we still don't have this like you know we're not in this place where even we've solved all these things like we're also trying to figure out ways that we can better support people to get into leadership roles and I think this is true whether it's in a leadership capacity or many other ways everyone's kind of at different points in this journey so what that might look like for one community might be different for another but we need to at least acknowledge that there's still some work to do. Another one is coming back to this whole thing that many of the district communities have started to build teams or initiatives around diversity equity and inclusion we really need to support that kind of work in our district communities so we need to invest more time energy and resources into this kind of work and additionally coming up with ways to measure better measure our efforts so we better understand what's working and what isn't because we want to make sure that we're investing our time wisely on this too and again kind of the examples I mentioned Arch Linux women and the Fedora DEI team but even outside of the distro space there's lots of communities like this as well like I know the Drupal diversity team in the content management system world does a lot around their community and has had a big impact in Drupal. Additionally we really need to emphasize this idea of really listening and trying out new ways and ideas of working you know we need to try things that might not have been done before or maybe even we're done before and failed but sometimes we also have to go back to some of these things and try again or take a different approach things won't change if we don't try new things take new approaches and listen closely to feedback from our community really emphasizing this active listening piece and again I think part of this is also emphasizing actually the next part is also with the diversifying our recruitment efforts so spending time to really I think this kind of ties into leadership as well but trying to make sure that we're tapping into growing our community in places that need more more visibility and light I think that outreach-y case is a really great one because that's a great opportunity for projects to advertise these opportunities to work in even some very key parts of a project community like in in Fedora Linux we've had folks working in from areas of the Linux kernel to metrics and data parts of the project where they're getting more insight into what's happening in our project and sharing those things back with the community to help us understand whether it's like a DEI focus or more broadly just around like packaging and things that we're doing in the project it's important that we're taking those steps to diversify who we're bringing into the project and making sure that we're taking full account of where we're spending our time and energy and for the last bit I will pass it back to Amita to finish us out thank you so much Justin uh one of the very critical point here is that even if we are doing a lot of efforts which Justin has specified in different communities be it for the Fedora Pache Edda women and a lot of them right around us we have successfully brought the women in already we have diversified the group now but this is the time that we really give the equality and the equal respect the equal pay grades and the equal rewards to these women I I know I cannot talk about some of these examples which I have seen myself that even if the women and men are on the same position in the same department in the same organization the pay gap is huge still huge and even numbers says that from there is an article from Australian Government which mentioned that only 17.1% of the women reaches to the CEO levels 25.8% to the board members of the company only 30% of the key management positions so you still see there is a huge gap and the huge way to go to overcome these gaps between the salaries between the leadership position and because the impact is also huge we think that okay this is the current uh situation no over the period of the time if you look at the compound salary by the time the a woman retires she has very less amount of money than a man has so if a woman loses her spouse or sees any unfortunate events in her life she has to face the poverty even though she is working much more harder at the home and the office and balancing well over there so with that it's very critical to have the equal pay and recognition we need to encourage women to take the leadership role as well we all has been saying that how important it is but one fact one thing which I would like to share from my perspective and my personal journey as well women try to reach to that level but then because of some personal issues or the birth or death or whatever they need to take a step back but then when they come back it is hard for them to you know walk those steps I have seen that when I was there in the Fedora and now I have joined we have moved so fast from IRC to telegram to even now signal and from Pagier to GitLab and everything has changed so fast it is so overwhelming to catch up with all of these things it's necessary to give a helping hand and mentors and supporters to these women who would like to come back to these communities and make an impact so it is very necessary and also don't look at the speed of the contribution because from where they are coming they are trying to balance with a lot of things at home at office at open source contribution so don't look at the speed don't try to measure their contribution like how many tickets they have done so far they are still learning and try to overcome that gap which is huge and overwhelming so be respectful for that last but not the least the mindset change is very necessary for everyone because we all know that if we support the inclusivity we are we can better innovate and the mindset change is also necessary for the women as well I'm standing here talking about talking to you with all with all of you about all of these things but at the back of my mind somewhere I'm thinking about my eight years old girl did she had enough meal that her father is able to make her braids because that is necessary rule for the school so all of those guilty trips we've movement always have those guilty trips in back of our mind because we think we are the primary caregiver so we also need to change that mindset if we are doing something for ourselves to making our career better please don't go on those guilty trips okay so that is for us as well with that very important question for uh I don't know where slides is not showing up it's on the screen here let's try I'll try playing an interview of someone who contributed a quick one minute one we'll try to do this with laptop speakers and see how it goes where's this it's okay it's fine we can skip we figured we'd improvise this one a little bit but basically one of the things that she's emphasizing here in her interview is she's talking about some of these recent changes that that flexibility that people who are also prioritizing family in their life there's more of an awareness that sometimes family comes first it's not always about you know 50 hour 60 hour work weeks I think there's a kind of a going to that whole changing mindset piece that there's more of an acceptance or more of an understanding for that now than there was again 20 years ago and we'll we'll upload the slides on the Fosden website so if you want to see the video you can go probably in the next day or two onto the Fosden website and you can find and play the video interview too and with that I would like to ask just in that what he thinks is the most important thing for the women because now you are part of the fedora council and serving a very critical role I think I kind of said one of my points is like you know I'm I see my role in the in the fedora community and I think one thing we can continue to emphasize and push for like in the fedora council which is our top level group trying to make these leadership opportunities more accessible and also clear for people like so there's not kind of an ambiguity or feeling like they're it's so far away from people but trying to maybe bring it a little bit closer and make those opportunities to contribute really powerful and I have to acknowledge that and Justin is doing that job very well and he has helped me a lot to come back with that I would like to open the floor for all of you if you have any questions I think we are at time because you would like to come and talk with us we'll be around the room and in
