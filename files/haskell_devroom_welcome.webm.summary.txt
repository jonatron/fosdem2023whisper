The talk is a welcome speech at the first Haskell Dev Room at FOSDEM, a conference about free and open source software development. The speaker announces a lineup of speakers on various topics aimed at newcomers or those who haven't programmed in Haskell for long. They also mention a live stream, a chat room for questions, and a raffle with prizes for newcomers. The speaker encourages attendees to grab some stickers and introduces the first talk.
