00:00.000 --> 00:11.240
Okay, hello. Sorry for the technical trouble. My machine didn't work for this screen, so

00:11.240 --> 00:19.520
I got the help from a colleague. So, I'm Marco Mäkele. I've been working on an ENO-DB

00:19.520 --> 00:27.520
code for 20 years almost, and today I will talk about one of my pet hates in ENO-DB,

00:27.520 --> 00:32.960
this change buffer, which I long time suspected that it's causing bugs, but I couldn't prove

00:32.960 --> 00:39.280
all of them. So, I took a car analogy because some software people like car analogies this

00:39.280 --> 00:46.400
unsafe at any speed. It's from the 1960s. I'm a bicycle person myself. So, what was

00:46.400 --> 00:53.480
the change buffer good for? It was something developed in the times of the spinning rust,

00:53.480 --> 01:00.360
the hard disks. The idea was that when you are doing sequential I.O., like page reads

01:00.360 --> 01:06.800
or page writes sequentially, then the read write hit will move less on the hard disk.

01:06.800 --> 01:15.960
And if you're doing random cx, it could take a long time to position the head to the correct

01:15.960 --> 01:21.240
track and then wait for the sector to come under the track when it's rotating. So, the

01:21.240 --> 01:27.760
idea of the change buffer was that instead of reading something from a page and then

01:27.760 --> 01:34.560
applying a change to that page, you would write a buffer change to somewhere else. So,

01:34.560 --> 01:42.920
if a B3 secondary index leaf page is not in the memory, in that case, instead of reading

01:42.920 --> 01:48.640
the page to perform an insert, originally it was only insert buffering, we would write

01:48.640 --> 01:54.080
that insert operation into a separate insert buffer tree. And then later when some other

01:54.080 --> 01:59.520
operation needs to read the page, it would merge the changes from that buffer to the

01:59.520 --> 02:05.000
page. And these structures are persistent. So, even the insert buffering could happen

02:05.000 --> 02:10.440
years ago and then at some point years later happens somebody wants to access that page

02:10.440 --> 02:19.640
and then you'll get the trouble. This was extended in MySQL 5.5 to cover delete operations

02:19.640 --> 02:26.120
and purge operations. Deleting in InnoDB only marks the record for deletion, same for update

02:26.120 --> 02:33.240
of a key in a secondary index, it will do delete marking and insert. So, the purge is

02:33.240 --> 02:38.000
what is actually removing the record. Those operations could be buffered, but not rollback

02:38.000 --> 02:45.800
of an insert, that was never buffered. And this leads to lots of problems, like the

02:45.800 --> 02:51.720
change buffer is located in the InnoDB system table space. And up to this time there is

02:51.720 --> 02:56.280
no mechanism to shrink the system table space. If you at some point use the change buffer

02:56.280 --> 03:01.560
a lot, the system table space will grow by some hundreds of gigabytes, there's no way

03:01.560 --> 03:05.560
to reclaim that space. Okay, in MariaDB we have something, we are working on something

03:05.560 --> 03:13.720
to help with that, but it's not done yet. And then this obvious right amplification,

03:13.720 --> 03:19.560
if you are doing an insert, okay, that's rather fine. Instead of doing just one insert, you

03:19.560 --> 03:25.360
are doing two inserts, you are doubling the right, plus you have to write some metadata,

03:25.360 --> 03:31.520
some index information so that the contents of the page can be interpreted correctly because

03:31.520 --> 03:37.160
the change buffer doesn't have access to the data dictionary. But for delete or delete

03:37.160 --> 03:43.560
marking, if you apply the change directly to the page, you would write one byte or couple

03:43.560 --> 03:47.840
of bytes, now you have to copy the entire record which you are going to delete or delete

03:47.840 --> 03:54.000
marked to the change buffer and the metadata. And then at some point it will be merged.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.960
And then there is some overhead, even if you are disabling the change buffer, you still

03:57.960 --> 04:05.000
have some overhead, you have to maintain some metadata saying how full your pages are. If

04:05.000 --> 04:10.560
somebody is going to enable the change buffering or insert buffering later, this data has to

04:10.560 --> 04:15.840
be accurate, otherwise you would get a page overflow. The insert buffering must know that

04:15.840 --> 04:21.960
the page will not get too full when you are buffering the insert and merging later. And

04:21.960 --> 04:27.240
then we got lots of nice corruptions where the secondary index gets out of sync with

04:27.240 --> 04:33.520
the primary key index. And these are very hard to reproduce. So why is it hard to reproduce?

04:33.520 --> 04:40.960
Well, the first part is the same as on the previous slide. It is exactly this that you

04:40.960 --> 04:48.480
cannot easily control when the change buffer merge happens. It's like the Spanish inquisition

04:48.480 --> 04:56.760
in the Montice Python sketch. Nobody expects a change buffer merge. And to reproduce something,

04:56.760 --> 05:03.360
as a user, you are unlucky and as a tester, you are lucky if you can reproduce this. And

05:03.360 --> 05:09.560
you need lots of luck to get that. Because especially this perching of the history, which

05:09.560 --> 05:16.480
is deleting records from the index, it can be blocked by reviews. Like if you have long

05:16.480 --> 05:21.400
running transactions which are holding a review open, that will prevent perch from running.

05:21.400 --> 05:26.600
And then at some point that review will be closed and perch can start running. And then

05:26.600 --> 05:31.280
there is also this buffer pool. If a page is locked by something, it can't be written

05:31.280 --> 05:36.440
out and it can't be evicted from the buffer pool. So the change buffer can't be used.

05:36.440 --> 05:42.160
And we have a debug setting that forces that, okay, user is asking for operation that could

05:42.160 --> 05:46.600
use the change buffer and we see the page is in the buffer pool. We are going the evil

05:46.600 --> 05:51.800
and we evict the page. But we cannot do that because somebody could be holding a latch

05:51.800 --> 05:55.880
on that page or the current thread is holding a latch and the page was modified. And we

05:55.880 --> 06:04.040
cannot wait for page writes to happen because this latch is blocking the page write. So

06:04.040 --> 06:11.360
this is really difficult to test. And there was a recent fix to some hanks which were

06:11.360 --> 06:19.720
introduced in MySQL 5.7. We have that fix in the release that is coming out next week.

06:19.720 --> 06:27.720
That one will make it even more tricky this debug option. So in order for tests for this

06:27.720 --> 06:34.200
to be effective, they have to do some smart tricks like abandon some tables for a while

06:34.200 --> 06:40.280
and let them cool down. Use some other tables meanwhile and then come back.

06:40.280 --> 06:48.840
Well, we got some nice magic tools as well. We have this random query generator. It's

06:48.840 --> 06:58.080
also used at MySQL and a grammar simplifier. We could start with the huge grammar of all

06:58.080 --> 07:04.840
of the SQL covering all the features and let it run. If the crash was frequent enough,

07:04.840 --> 07:12.280
then we could use this grammar simplifier. But in this case, this is very hard to reproduce

07:12.280 --> 07:17.120
back. We cannot use the simplifier. We cannot get any simpler grammar. We just have to run

07:17.120 --> 07:26.080
it all and hope for the best. But then we got this debugger RR, record and replay.

07:26.080 --> 07:34.320
That one is really a huge productivity boost. We started using it maybe two or three years

07:34.320 --> 07:42.360
ago. So when you are able to reproduce a problem while running it under RR, what you would

07:42.360 --> 07:50.320
do that you will save RR record will save a trace, a deterministic trace of an execution

07:50.320 --> 07:57.080
that is interleaving processors or threads that are being monitored by it. It saves

07:57.080 --> 08:04.880
the system calls and the results and so on. And this trace can be debugged as many times

08:04.880 --> 08:10.360
as you want. You just need the same binaries, same libraries and compatible processor. Then

08:10.360 --> 08:15.960
you can run it. And you can set break points, you can set data watch points and you can

08:15.960 --> 08:21.880
execute in forward and backward direction. You can see what happened before the bad thing

08:21.880 --> 08:27.000
was observed. And this can also be used for optimized code. You are probably familiar

08:27.000 --> 08:33.800
with cases where you are debugging an optimized executable, then the debugger complains that

08:33.800 --> 08:38.400
some variable has been optimized out. Well, then you can just single step some instructions,

08:38.400 --> 08:44.680
you get it from the registers, because you can go backwards in time. So now I am coming

08:44.680 --> 08:52.080
to describe one bug that we found last year. And actually there was a support customer

08:52.080 --> 08:59.760
last week who hit this bug or a consequence of this bug. So we had a bug that would be

08:59.760 --> 09:04.040
a slow shutdown which is doing this change buffer merge. It would hang because the change

09:04.040 --> 09:09.200
buffer got corrupted. And we were testing some fixes in a branch for that. And then

09:09.200 --> 09:15.040
we got this assertion failure. This assertion failure essentially means that when it tried

09:15.040 --> 09:22.080
to insert a record that was insert buffered, it ran out of space in the page. And what

09:22.080 --> 09:30.000
was the reason? Well, there were some extra records in the page. And it turned out that

09:30.000 --> 09:36.200
this is partly by design. Hei Kittori, the creator of InnoDB, he was a friend of lazy

09:36.200 --> 09:42.400
deletion or lazy operations. So drop index wouldn't clear anything from the change buffer.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.720
It would leave the garbage behind. And later on, if the same page is reallocated for something

09:46.720 --> 09:54.040
else, then we would pay the price and free the space from the change buffer, delete the

09:54.040 --> 10:02.360
records. And in MySQL 5.7, there was a new feature, bulk insert creation or building

10:02.360 --> 10:10.480
indexes faster. And that codebase didn't do this adjustment correctly. It only cleared

10:10.480 --> 10:16.240
some bit, but it didn't remove the records. And there was a mandatory Oracle security

10:16.240 --> 10:22.000
train I took several years ago before switching to MariaDB. It said something like complexity

10:22.000 --> 10:28.120
is the friend of security bugs. I found it somehow fitting here.

10:28.120 --> 10:34.360
So the immediate root cause of this failure was that this new code cleared a bit that

10:34.360 --> 10:41.240
says that there are buffer changes for this page. So when somebody is going to use that

10:41.240 --> 10:45.560
page, he will see that, OK, there's nothing to do. I don't have to care about the change

10:45.560 --> 10:51.680
buffer. And then later on, something adds records to the page, and then these old records

10:51.680 --> 10:57.200
from the change buffer will come to the page as part of a merge.

10:57.200 --> 11:03.560
And how can we prove this using this RR tool? By the way, you can download the slides from

11:03.560 --> 11:10.240
the first page, and you can also download an attachment that has a script replay recording

11:10.240 --> 11:15.560
of the RR session. So I'm only showing some high-level view here, but you can download

11:15.560 --> 11:22.440
a debugger session that shows the exact commands and the output, which I'm going to present

11:22.440 --> 11:29.440
in the next slides. So the short version, how we did this, how we can prove these claims

11:29.440 --> 11:35.360
in the debugger, we let it continue from the start to the crash or the assertion failure.

11:35.360 --> 11:41.000
Then we set the break point on a function that was the last one to access the change

11:41.000 --> 11:47.360
buffer bitmap bits. And from that function, we get the address of the bitmap bits for

11:47.360 --> 11:53.040
this page, and we can set the data watch point on that. And I found this hardware watch

11:53.040 --> 11:57.600
point is a very powerful tool. It's really much easier for some things when you don't

11:57.600 --> 12:02.640
have an idea which code is going to modify or read something.

12:02.640 --> 12:07.560
And then based on this watch point, we get some call stacks where these change buffer

12:07.560 --> 12:13.240
bits were last changed. And then we set the break points on functions that insert records

12:13.240 --> 12:17.120
into the change buffer and delete records from there. And then we observe that, okay,

12:17.120 --> 12:23.960
there was nothing to delete records for this page and basically proving this claim. So

12:23.960 --> 12:31.840
we are printing the index ID and index name to get some more detail to this proof.

12:31.840 --> 12:41.000
Oh, sorry. Okay, so we were unable to reproduce this with a small grammar. We just took something

12:41.000 --> 12:46.440
and we got lucky and got the trace and debugged it.

12:46.440 --> 12:54.800
Possible consequences of this bug are the wrong results. That's of course very difficult

12:54.800 --> 13:00.320
to prove. You don't have any testing tools to prove that really or not many tools. Or

13:00.320 --> 13:06.000
you could get the crash on change buffer merge like here we got. And that change buffer merge

13:06.000 --> 13:10.200
could happen any time, even if you are running check table to check if your table is okay,

13:10.200 --> 13:16.480
then before my score, MariaDB 10.6, your server would crash because of this change buffer

13:16.480 --> 13:23.840
corruption. So in our case, it was a page overflow when applying an insert. And change

13:23.840 --> 13:28.120
buffer doesn't allow any page splitting. It must fit in the page. In the support case

13:28.120 --> 13:35.680
I mentioned one week ago, the case was that the page split failed. It ran out of space.

13:35.680 --> 13:40.160
You are taking one page, you are trying to copy part of the records to a new page and

13:40.160 --> 13:47.400
it ran out of space. How can that be? It turned out that the page contained records for some

13:47.400 --> 13:55.000
other index which apparently had been dropped earlier and that index apparently had not

13:55.000 --> 14:03.800
null columns. So the length of a variable length field was interpreted, was stored there for

14:03.800 --> 14:10.560
that index where this correct index would have the null bit map. And then we would read

14:10.560 --> 14:15.680
the length of the record from previous byte and that's how we would get these two long

14:15.680 --> 14:24.640
records being copied. Oh, five minutes left. I have to hurry up. So this debugging, how

14:24.640 --> 14:31.000
it goes in detail, we continue to the end of the execution from the start. And then

14:31.000 --> 14:37.280
we reverse continue to go back from the abort signal. Then we set the temporary breakpoint

14:37.280 --> 14:46.480
to this bitmap page access. Then we get to that breakpoint and we get in a register we

14:46.480 --> 14:51.720
happen to have the byte address of the bitmap byte which we are interested in. And then

14:51.720 --> 15:00.600
we reverse continue to the changes of that byte. So the last occurrence of that was for

15:00.600 --> 15:08.800
an insert that was buffered after the at index. And we continue from that, we see that this,

15:08.800 --> 15:14.440
the previous occurrence is the at index that is clearing the flag. And from that we can

15:14.440 --> 15:21.840
get the page number which is affected and we can get the index ID and index name and

15:21.840 --> 15:30.640
the SQL statement which is alter table. And then we set some more breakpoints on this

15:30.640 --> 15:34.720
insert buffer delete and insert operations. Set the condition that we wanted only for

15:34.720 --> 15:40.880
this page and then we reverse continue, we get the insert that was buffered before this

15:40.880 --> 15:47.240
at index. Apparently there was a drop index in between but I didn't add statements to

15:47.240 --> 15:54.040
get a breakpoint there this time. So the index name is different as after the at index and

15:54.040 --> 16:00.920
index ID is different. And there was no call to the change buffer deletion. When we continue

16:00.920 --> 16:06.120
from this point to the end of the execution we just reached the assertion failure again

16:06.120 --> 16:12.520
without any change buffer record deletion in between.

16:12.520 --> 16:21.960
So I'm quoting this Finnish ski jumper who apparently was confusing to French phrases.

16:21.960 --> 16:28.560
He was wishing him a good trip when he is starting to do the ski jumping. And I'm wishing

16:28.560 --> 16:35.600
a good trip for anybody who is using the change buffer. So and the deja vu, yes, we have seen

16:35.600 --> 16:43.520
this shut down hang actually earlier. There was a 10.1, MariaDB 10.1 support customer case.

16:43.520 --> 16:50.240
They got this hang and we had to do something to fix that. But in MariaDB 10.5 we made

16:50.240 --> 16:59.000
another change hopefully to reduce the chances of getting like random change buffer much

16:59.000 --> 17:08.520
because basically after this change buffer much only happens when SQL statement needs

17:08.520 --> 17:14.000
that change buffer much to happen. No background operation. So we had to adjust that previous

17:14.000 --> 17:20.800
fix for the 10.5 code base but that was not adjusted correctly. And we were not able to

17:20.800 --> 17:29.280
reproduce this corruption or this hang earlier. So only quite lately we were able to reproduce

17:29.280 --> 17:37.720
it and then we were able to debug it properly. There are some other corruption caused by

17:37.720 --> 17:46.560
the change buffer. And one thing I want to notice that in MariaDB 10.6 recently there

17:46.560 --> 17:52.640
was a fix that we should not crash on any page corruption. If there are any cases where

17:52.640 --> 17:59.080
we are still crashing I would be interested in details. And this includes like check table

17:59.080 --> 18:03.560
when there is a crash. When there is a failure during change buffer much it will not cause

18:03.560 --> 18:12.480
a crash. There was a mystery bug filed like 12 years ago. MySQL bug. The customer got

18:12.480 --> 18:19.600
a crash during change buffer much because the page got empty as a result of applying

18:19.600 --> 18:25.480
a perch operation. I can think of several bugs that have been fixed in MariaDB that

18:25.480 --> 18:33.800
could be the explanation. The last one, this one from the previous example that cannot

18:33.800 --> 18:40.960
apply because that only was introduced in MySQL 5.7 which they didn't use. And of this

18:40.960 --> 18:53.960
list the 30422 it's a clone of MySQL fix which is applicable to MariaDB 10.3 and 10.4. Others

18:53.960 --> 19:01.960
I don't think have been fixed in MySQL yet. So this teaches us that it really pays off

19:01.960 --> 19:10.840
to analyze any obscure failure you get from running with RR because there are games in

19:10.840 --> 19:15.960
there. And I think that assertions are like lottery tickets. If you don't write assertions

19:15.960 --> 19:23.520
in your code then you can't win these kind of bug findings. And sometimes you can lose,

19:23.520 --> 19:28.440
you can write a bogus assertion okay you make mistake, you correct it and improve the assertion

19:28.440 --> 19:37.360
and then hopefully you will get something better later. We have some mitigation for this in

19:37.360 --> 19:48.520
MariaDB. We don't access the data file when executing drop table. So if in that case we

19:48.520 --> 19:57.120
are avoiding maybe more crashes on drop table. And there was a bug in you know DB slow shutdown

19:57.120 --> 20:02.440
that the change buffer merge wouldn't check for log file overflow. So if the user got

20:02.440 --> 20:06.680
impatient and killed the server because it's taken too long time then they could end up

20:06.680 --> 20:15.800
with unrecoverable database. And some more mitigation that we disabled this change buffer

20:15.800 --> 20:22.320
by default. We deprecated the parameter and we removed the change buffer in the 11.0 release.

20:22.320 --> 20:29.840
The upgrade code for handling it, it was tested and I hope that if there is some corruption

20:29.840 --> 20:35.960
notice during the upgrade it should still be a possible to go back to the earlier version

20:35.960 --> 20:47.680
and then do something to correct. Yes, if there are any records in the change buffer

20:47.680 --> 20:53.880
we ignore, we don't trust these bitmap bits. We go through the change buffer records and

20:53.880 --> 21:03.480
if there are any we will apply them. Yeah, so that was basically what I wanted to say

21:03.480 --> 21:13.120
and maybe this last slide that it's a good thing to have a nice layer design if you optimize

21:13.120 --> 21:18.400
things by breaking this layer boundaries then you are asking for trouble. That's basically

21:18.400 --> 21:27.320
what we can learn from this. Question, you said that you fixed a few things in Merle

21:27.320 --> 21:36.480
DB and they're not yet fixed in upstream. Are there bugs open upstream for fixing these

21:36.480 --> 21:43.480
things? I haven't filed any, I lost my MySQL account when I resigned Oracle.

21:43.480 --> 21:52.040
Okay, well, I'll look into it so we can get this fixed in upstream. Yeah, you are welcome

21:52.040 --> 21:58.000
to file bugs and maybe they will be fixed. Well, especially if it's a crashing bug.

21:58.000 --> 22:07.960
Yeah, but you can't repeat them, so you have a hard time proving that. Well, there are

22:07.960 --> 22:12.680
tools obviously now, weren't obvious before. I'm very persistent. It's like once we know

22:12.680 --> 22:21.680
it exists in Merle DB as it takes and somebody that is persistent enough should be able to

22:21.680 --> 22:46.640
do that. Yes. It is very bad. I mean, if you have multiple threats or processes, it's running

22:46.640 --> 22:52.280
them on a single CPU core at the time. So that's why we are running hundreds of servers

22:52.280 --> 23:04.280
in parallel on a single server for several hours to get these traces. Actually, also

23:04.280 --> 23:09.120
for normal debugging, there have been cases like if you have lots of conditional branches

23:09.120 --> 23:18.760
in your code like this debug library or performance schema. Those branches are never taken, but

23:18.760 --> 23:24.080
because RR is interested in conditional branches. I have seen a case where if I compile without

23:24.080 --> 23:32.600
these things, I get a crash or problem in let's say like three seconds. And then I was curious

23:32.600 --> 23:38.240
how long does it take if I use these stupid compilation options with these extra conditions.

23:38.240 --> 23:44.040
For that particular thing, I interrupted it after two hours. So it was 7,000 seconds

23:44.040 --> 23:52.880
versus three seconds. So don't use conditional branches or unnecessary debugging. Turn off

23:52.880 --> 24:03.200
all the code that you don't need. Conditional branches are evil for RR. Well, maybe you

24:03.200 --> 24:12.080
are not using it like multi-threaded with context switches and so on. For single-threaded,

24:12.080 --> 24:38.800
there is basically no overhead. Thank you for saving me. It was a team effort.

24:38.800 --> 24:43.600
Thank you.

27:08.800 --> 27:34.600
One, two, three. Is it working? Okay, there is no audio in the room, right? So you want

27:34.600 --> 27:44.120
me to speak loud. Well, anyway, we are going to talk today about MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.10.

27:44.120 --> 27:49.960
Original Toxa is 10.11, but I wanted to make sure we're sticking to the latest GA or stable

27:49.960 --> 28:00.640
version so it had to go down a bit. Well, and let me start by congratulating MariaDB team

28:00.640 --> 28:09.320
with MariaDB Corporation going public. In particular, Monty, congrats for driving two

28:09.320 --> 28:16.520
very impactful open-source database companies to exit. That's quite an achievement, I think

28:16.520 --> 28:29.400
you people in the universe have that. Yeah. Well, so what are we going to talk about first?

28:29.400 --> 28:37.880
I think which we need to recognize where MariaDB and MySQL started from the same roots, right?

28:37.880 --> 28:44.960
We have diverged substantially, right? So I think it was interesting when on the previous

28:44.960 --> 28:49.200
talk, Jean-François was talking about the upstream, right? I was thinking, hey, you know,

28:49.200 --> 28:58.000
what does MariaDB really consider MySQL upstream at this point? Or not quite, right? In this

28:58.000 --> 29:04.680
case, I think there is enough diversity right what this is our kind of, you know, ancestors,

29:04.680 --> 29:11.760
maybe, you know, like monkeys for humans, you know, something of this regard. Now, in

29:11.760 --> 29:21.160
this case, like I am trying to be fair the best way I can, right, which for me always

29:21.160 --> 29:28.440
means offends everybody equally, right? So, you know, if Monty is not screaming at me

29:28.440 --> 29:32.960
saying you are fucking moron, Peter, that is not how it is, then probably I am not doing

29:32.960 --> 29:45.000
my job properly. No, no, no, but you... Oh, you see? Yes, yes, yes. Of course, of course.

29:45.000 --> 29:50.520
You always do everything with loving your heart, right? And you don't use bad words

29:50.520 --> 29:57.520
as I do. That is wonderful. So, let's talk about development model first. Obviously,

29:57.520 --> 30:03.440
MySQL is developed by the Oracle corporations. We can see what the contributions are accepted,

30:03.440 --> 30:09.640
but I wouldn't say they are encouraged in the same way as MariaDB does. And we also have

30:09.640 --> 30:13.400
open source, as I would say, like a drop ship open source, right? We have those release

30:13.400 --> 30:20.400
coming, but we do not really have a tree there over developers changes, right, happen. You

30:20.400 --> 30:24.920
know, as we can see. That, I think, can be particularly problematic, for example, for

30:24.920 --> 30:31.760
security bugs where it can be hard to track, like, what exactly change fixes that particular

30:31.760 --> 30:40.120
issue, right, which is different from MariaDB, which is... has a server released by MariaDB

30:40.120 --> 30:48.040
Foundation, though there is a lot of work, right, for actual new features done by MariaDB

30:48.040 --> 30:54.520
corporations, though foundations ensure what the contributions are encouraged and developers

30:54.520 --> 31:02.600
really done in the public, right, as I would say, through open source project. One thing

31:02.600 --> 31:09.560
I wanted to point out, which I think is interesting, is also changes from the Oracle side, right?

31:09.560 --> 31:16.640
For years, I've been actually defender of Oracle in regards to, hey, you know, besides

31:16.640 --> 31:21.560
all this kind of stuff that Oracle is looking to kill MySQL, they have actually been doing

31:21.560 --> 31:27.880
a pretty good job in releasing majority features of the open source and the proprietary enterprise

31:27.880 --> 31:33.720
features have been kind of well-isolated, abstracted through API, and it was relatively

31:33.720 --> 31:39.480
easy for companies as well, especially, like, per corner, to implement the equivalent.

31:39.480 --> 31:44.000
Now things have been changing in the last couple of years, right? We can see what, everybody

31:44.000 --> 31:54.120
knows this guy? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, like, we can see what Larry actually discovered,

31:54.120 --> 32:01.600
what the MySQL exists in the last couple of years, right? And he only seems to care about

32:01.600 --> 32:09.680
the MySQL as a heatwave, because we all know heatwave supports the melt zone of lake, right?

32:09.680 --> 32:15.520
And we can see a lot of focus getting on this snowflake development, which is sort of a

32:15.520 --> 32:23.400
cloud-only, and of course, you know, proprietary version of MySQL. So far, it is only analytic

32:23.400 --> 32:28.600
extension, right? But I think it's all questions to us, hey, could there be some other critical

32:28.600 --> 32:33.960
features which will be only property, right? Maybe Oracle somewhere in a bellies developing

32:33.960 --> 32:37.960
something like transparent sharding for MySQL, maybe that is going to be proprietary first,

32:37.960 --> 32:42.840
right? So that is, I think, the questions what a lot of people in MySQL community are

32:42.840 --> 32:54.240
asking. Now, with MySQL, with MariaDB, I think what is interesting compared to, like, a MySQL

32:54.240 --> 33:00.320
is that there are actually two companies, MariaDB, well, two entities, probably better

33:00.320 --> 33:08.120
than MariaDB Foundation and MariaDB Corporation, right? That is the latest mission, which I

33:08.120 --> 33:16.520
just grabbed a couple of days ago from MariaDB Foundation side, right? And I think that is

33:16.520 --> 33:25.560
a very good to understand relationship with those companies to understand this, right?

33:25.560 --> 33:31.600
Now, if you think in this case is what MariaDB Foundation is really at large focusing on

33:31.600 --> 33:38.760
serving MariaDB community, MariaDB ecosystem, right? It develops open-source software around

33:38.760 --> 33:44.480
MySQL. They are MariaDB Corporation. That is now public company, right? Which is providing

33:44.480 --> 33:51.920
a property solutions and commercializing MariaDB software, right? That is, I think, the interest

33:51.920 --> 33:58.320
way, right? Now, relationship sometimes can be a little bit complicated, though I would

33:58.320 --> 34:03.920
say there have been some more complicated entitlements in which I mentioned in my previous

34:03.920 --> 34:11.760
talks, right? And some of them have been made more clear, which I think is a great progress.

34:11.760 --> 34:17.200
So if you think about this, what is interesting is MariaDB Foundation has responsibility kind

34:17.200 --> 34:22.040
of relatively narrow to the MariaDB server, right? And we can see what number of other

34:22.040 --> 34:30.120
components which are very valuable in MySQL ecosystem are owned by MariaDB Corporation,

34:30.120 --> 34:40.600
right? Not by the Foundation and also a lot of development. Roadmap is driven by the Corporation.

34:40.600 --> 34:45.600
I also find it interesting what we see MySQL knowledge base, which is kind of built by

34:45.600 --> 34:52.800
a community but is hosted by MariaDB Corporation. I find that not in a very good sense for like

34:52.800 --> 35:00.120
an open-source software, there is also entanglement on the website level, right? So if I am downloading

35:00.120 --> 35:11.120
MariaDB software from.org, right, then I am kind of redirected next to the MariaDB

35:11.120 --> 35:17.800
Corporation knowledge base, right? And encouraged to fill out the lead which will go to their

35:17.800 --> 35:22.640
MariaDB Corporation, which is not totally transparent, right? I think that's kind of, I may be still

35:22.640 --> 35:31.200
looking like, oh, I am engaging with a non-profit while actually I am giving my connections

35:31.200 --> 35:36.920
to somewhere else. Now, I wouldn't say though that that is completely unfair in this case

35:36.920 --> 35:44.040
because MariaDB does carry the largest way to development and promote in MariaDB, right?

35:44.040 --> 35:55.200
And they do also get the largest rewards compared to the other sponsors of MariaDB Foundation.

35:55.200 --> 36:02.920
Now let's look quickly at what is really open-source between those versions, right? Now, in MySQL,

36:02.920 --> 36:13.760
what we can see is a very clear open-core platform and we have Maria, MySQL community, right?

36:13.760 --> 36:20.600
And, you know, router, cluster, whatever, all that comes which comes in open-source edition

36:20.600 --> 36:26.360
and there is also enterprise version. Plus, as I mentioned, additionally, we have increasing

36:26.360 --> 36:37.920
focus on the cloud-only solution as a heat wave. In terms of MariaDB, there are, you

36:37.920 --> 36:44.200
know, a lot more nuance in this case, right? Because there are certain things coming from

36:44.200 --> 36:51.880
MariaDB Foundation which are completely open-source right now. The things in MariaDB Corporation

36:51.880 --> 36:58.200
Spaceway can be with a variety of licenses.
