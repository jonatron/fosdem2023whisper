The talk focuses on breaking away from Big Tech using open source infrastructure and is aimed at small and medium teams. The speakers discuss the issues with Big Tech, including wealth accumulation and anti-innovation practices, and the reasons why small teams continue to use these platforms, such as convenience and integration. They propose a two-part solution: an ideological side, where small tech companies that use open source tools should be embraced, and a hands-on approach, where several options, such as do-it-yourself hosting, no-code platforms, internal team management, hosting collectives, and open source infrastructure-managed service providers, are presented. The speakers stress the importance of not being vendor locked into any one solution and being fully aware of legal implications and moderation. A new managed service provider for Mastodon is announced.
