The speaker discussed the implementation of debug packages in Arch Linux, which allows for better debugging experiences and saves disk space. They explained the use of detached debug symbols to separate debug information from binaries and the implementation of a build ID to link and distribute the debug information. The speaker also discussed the inclusion of source code in debug packages, which is supported by some distributions, and the use of a debug info instance, which allows users to fetch source code and symbols from binaries over HTTP. The speaker also touched on the improvement of debug info support in Go, particularly in rust, Julia and other programming languages. The talk concluded with a discussion of the infrastructure and metrics involved in implementing debug packages in Arch Linux.
