The talk was given at the FOSDEM conference in 2023, and the speaker introduced the Foundation for Public Code, which provides tools and processes for public organizations to collaboratively build and maintain open source code as public infrastructure. The idea of public code is open source code that implements public policy for the public good. The speaker also discussed the Digital Public Goods Alliance, which recognizes and promotes digital public goods that adhere to best practices, do not harm, and advance UN's Sustainable Development Goals. The alliance has recognized 127 public goods and offers discoverability, support for usability, and deployment capacity to bring these goods to scale.
