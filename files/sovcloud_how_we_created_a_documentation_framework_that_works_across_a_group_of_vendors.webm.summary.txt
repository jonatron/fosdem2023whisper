Max, a knowledge management engineer at the Sovereign Cloud Stack, presented a documentation framework for the Sovereign Cloud Stack at the FOSDEM conference in 2023. The Sovereign Cloud Stack combines the best of cloud computing in one unified standard, and it is built by an active open-source committee. The documentation framework, which is a set of GitHub Action workflows, copies markdown files from different repositories to one single repository and builds them into a single-page application resulting in the Sovereign Cloud Stack documentation. The framework is designed to be a low entry hurdle for companies with existing repositories, and it uses Docusaurus React-based static site generator to structure and curate the documentation. The aim is to have all doc files and folders in one place, making it easy to search, access guides, tutorials, and references. The framework is currently accepting markdown files only but could be converted to other documentation formats in the future.
