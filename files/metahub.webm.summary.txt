Christian's lightning talk at the FOSDEM conference discussed the HPC container conformance project which aims to provide guidance on how to build and annotate HPC containers for Gromax and PyTorch. The focus is on creating generic and highly optimized images with annotations to facilitate easy discovery and expectation management. Mandatory and optional annotations for the container were also discussed, and the talk concluded with the need for a tool to match annotations against the host system. The overall goal is to create standardized annotations that can be adapted by different container runtimes.
