The developer community architect for The Document Foundation discusses the status of smart art support for LibreOffice. While important display is very good, there are problems with saving and editing, and audio compatibility is non-existent. There are also bugs in text rendering, spacing, font color, and rotation, but the result is usually good, sometimes even better than Microsoft Office. Application support is available for Writer and Impress, but not for Calc. The talk ends with a Q&A section.
