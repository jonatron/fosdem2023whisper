{"text": " Thanks for joining us tonight, a long day in the digital, in the sovereign cloud room. We've heard a lot of great presentations before and I hope I can shed some additional light on this definition of digital sovereignty and how open source or how we believe that open source and maybe extending the way we do open source can help us to achieve more here. Just quickly introducing myself, first I've been doing open source for all of my professional life, actually I started before. I was part of the professional life at university in the 90s when I was doing some work on the Linux kernel contributing to the SCSI stack there and SCSI drivers which was really fun and which really helped me to kind of get the the fascination of working with with really people around the world on great technology and that was then actually what my professional life became and I was working in Sousa where I built up Sousa Labs that was actually a significant part of my career and then also been building clouds for Deutsche Telekom T-Systems so I was actually in the open telecom cloud project as head architect there and also during the time I was part of a number of communities and organizations EFF. Linux for Bund which became OSPA which kind of funnily today is my employer and that's actually the sovereign cloud tech project which we were able to start which brought us to work extremely closely with the German ministry for economic affairs and climate action that's the one who's paying us and the open source business alliance which runs this project and which employs me and yes over the time I've been able to contribute to a number of projects Linux kernel new compiler open stack and now with cluster API Kubernetes stuff also working in that so we've heard quite some some good reasoning why digital sovereignty is a thing and to kind of make it very fundamental if you look what IT does today to our lives in private lives in all of the things we do with our industry also our society our public administration they all depend on IT in a way that they didn't use to depend on IT 20 years ago and this is only going to get larger and more important so it's important for us to make sure we have control over the systems we are using and we are in a position that we can determine how we want to use these systems and right now this is something that is under question and we've heard it very good from Ludovico before that we are in trouble there we are in a challenge there a lot of I mean from an economic perspective a lot of the value creation happens in IT platforms in software in infrastructure and of course there's a lot of are we able to determine or to even set laws that we are able to follow if there's a lot of infrastructure all of what we do privately and in the industry depend on doesn't comply to how can we kind of resolve that and of course there's there's the question I mean we have this GDPR which I believe I mean GDPR can be annoying in details but in overall it's a great thing because the idea of protecting or restricting what companies and governance can do with our data actually is part of what gives us as individuals the freedom to not be being watched and being analyzed all the time and this is a very fundamental freedom right that we have and the thing we need to kind of ask ourselves is we have these great laws and question is can we actually implement them and actually are we serious about our law are we actually complying to it and talking to companies talking to people in the industry I mean I once wanted to kind of poke people a bit and said well I guess at least half of the usage of public clouds in Europe is illegal if we take GDPR seriously and I was expecting to get a lot of fire back when I said that and the the only comment I really got back was well only 50% I think it's a lot more so this is the status quo we don't have exact numbers I don't have I have not done a study on that but we know a lot of public cloud usage isn't legal if we take our laws seriously and the question is how can we how can we improve on that how can we actually make it reality and we we have regulation that is supposed to help but then of course we need to take it seriously there's Digital Markets Act Digital Services Act which is certainly a good legislation that helps us and we have this data protection thing which we need to start getting more serious about one thing we've seen come out of that debate is now that there is in several countries are initiatives that US hyperscalar enter partnerships with local companies and try to structure the partnerships in the way that the local companies fully in control of the infrastructure and operations with it so the hyperscalar doesn't have access to it so the cloud act wouldn't apply we have to I guess look into the details whether that actually fulfills the data protection requirement or not depends a lot on a lot of details and one of the things I've learned in my career that once I was trying to operate infrastructure to operate software that it was built for being run by the software company itself in a DevOps model and we were trying to run it as a third party and it was awfully painful and that is of course the thing that now these local providers that do partnerships with with Microsoft or Google need to go through and learn a lot invest a lot and actually Microsoft and Google would have to invest a lot to make it runnable by others so that's one thing they need to overcome but maybe they do that might resolve the GDPR question what it does not resolve is actually the fact can we actually understand the technology do we have to transparency want can we actually provide more influence and value from European companies and there's been discussions that we need alternatives not just regulation but alternatives and one of the things that I've heard discussed was well let's build a European Amazon let's build a European hyperscaler and to be very honest I don't believe in that I think replacing the dependency on a monopolist or a few or liquor polis with just another monopolist that everybody then depends on does not improve the situation much it may improve it a tiny bit because maybe there's a bit more legal control but it really replaces a dependency with another dependency so it's it's not a large step forward the other thing I've heard well I mean let's let's make sure we only use European software and honestly I don't think that is something we should seriously consider if we understand open source because open source does does not need us to restrict ourselves for to a certain country and I think Marcel has made that point very very nicely in his no it was not you it was Ludovico I guess that that that if you have open source where you have control that is not needed digital sovereignty so I want to take a step back and think well what is it we want to achieve with digital sovereignty and talking to companies understanding what they want to do also talking to to to public administration people it is really about the ability to take decisions on your own and obviously if you take that to an extreme it would mean you don't have any dependencies I don't think anybody in the modern world can create platforms where you don't depend in many many ways on others so in the end what is really I think we need to do to do this is to manage those dependencies and the risks we get from those dependencies in a very very conscious way understand them maybe we can avoid some of them and where we cannot avoid them make sure that the relationship we have with people that we depend on is well understood and we have a certain amount of negotiation power that that makes sure we can we can control things and we have talked to organizations to understand what is it what is the various dimensions of risks they want to to kind of address and to to manage and we we found like this list of four different directions that generally people were interested in that was the first one is of course this legal compliance thing this is something that any company needs to of course do the second thing is well actually I mean if we have a supplier which we have a certain dependence on we want to make sure whenever needed we can switch and switching of course is something that can be very easy in theory and extremely hard in practice so in order to to make the switch a viable option we need to structure the way we use this platform or maybe to structure the way this platform is being designed in a way that switching cost is low and I mean the the ultimate possibility to to switch could also be that an insourcing option happens so if things go really bad I could take actually a platform and run it myself that would be like the ultimate proof that as switching is possible the third thing is the technology platform we depend on basically opens up new possibilities and closes off other ones so it basically limits the amount of things we can do on top of that platform and of course if you as as a company for example want to evolve in a certain direction it may become limiting to you so actually what you would like is to have a way to influence how this platform is evolving in the future. The fourth thing we heard a lot is a discussion on transparency we want to understand how our data is stored how is it being secured from being improperly accessed do we have that level of transparency and do we have the skills to actually understand how it works so if we make certain if you want to make certain improvements do we do we understand them we've heard this before I guess this is kind of preaching to the choir a bit open source of course helps a lot with achieving our goal here using open source I mean the amount of control you get as the user of open source is so much larger than the amount of control you have over over being a user of proprietary software it's a different it's a different league it's a different world so we don't need to have that discussion that open source that's what our software needs to come from a specific country or from a specific continent this is this can be a relevant discussion if you're using proprietary software because then you don't have a lot of rights if you're using open source the idea is to do open source right and if you do that right you don't need to to ask that question and of course I mean the the ability to build on top of each other is something that is inherent to to the way we do open source so I mean we all today are using systems that well over 20 years a lot of smart people have developed doing doing Linux well 30 something year actually there's one thing I think we need to be aware of I mean a decade ago or so we were discussing that open source is really needed and we need to open source in order to have control over our own fate today I hear a lot of companies saying well we do open source and it's become something in their marketing checklist if they think well the recipient asks for open source we will we will check that check mark right because they ask for it and we do something somewhere in the open and I think the the one thing we need to be really careful about is we have built this great open source movement where we have achieved a lot and now we hear people saying open source without meaning it and we need to be careful to to call them out and to not let them get away with that they build projects which are partially open source but if you want to use them you cannot because of course there's these other components that you need in order to to use the software which is I don't want to say that the open source pieces are useless but they're not very useful and it's certainly not not open source as a whole or people invent strange licenses which are not even OSI compliant which restricts you in very surprising ways be careful on that or people build these open core models where you have like access to some useful core piece of technology but then if you want to do the really useful things with it you need the proprietary extensions not very useful so be be careful there's other things we've seen which I think we need to be careful about is that sometimes projects are built inside a company and then that companies as well okay maybe we can reach a larger market by making it open source and this is a great thing I applaud that company for doing that but we also need to be careful the company needs to invest into building a community so that the dependence of that open source code on that single company gets lower over time because otherwise there's if that company is the sole owner of taking decisions of contributing of having knowledge on that software stack it really doesn't make us a lot more sovereign it does in theory but the need the work needs to be invested to to build the competence the local competence as we heard earlier today and then yes I mean decision-making development process it can be closed and that is not what we want the open infar foundation has I think a good way of kind of addressing all those concerns about not really open projects with the four opens where it's not just the license the license is important and it needs to be OSI license it needs to be fully open source not not an open core model and the development process needs to be open the design discussions the decision taking needs to be transparent and the community needs to be open and diverse not just single vendor and looking at the list I made before of what companies expect from being sovereign I just kind of make this this little non-scientific taxonomy how much sovereignty can users have if they're using these platforms obviously if you're on a on a hyperscalar I mean even GDPR compliance is not something you can achieve there's this model I said where we have this trustee model where you have local providers of hyperscalar technology where it's fully operated hopefully which solves that problem but I mean the ability to to to have choice to switch provider is not there the ability to insource to run this stack yourself is not there you cannot really shape the technology and adjust it to your own needs and you don't build the skills how this software works and operates so you don't you don't really score on those levels if you would build a you hyperscalar it wouldn't be that much better maybe you have a bit of better handle on the on the GDPR things but it doesn't it doesn't solve the problem if you if you deploy private clouds actually you're in a better shape even if you build that on proprietary technology because at least I mean insourcing is then something that is very real because that's the decision you have taken you could have a third a third party actually doing some some of that management for you of course and you build some skills you learn how to operate it now does does open source solve the problem for you well it does partially and I think there's some additional steps and I'll talk about them in in a second one of the things with open source with building open source or using open source public clouds or building open source private clouds is that switching may not be easy still because if you have five companies that build open source clouds you may end up in a situation that those five clouds may use some of the same technology components but all of them are configured and run in a very different way which makes which means switching from one to the other is still extremely painful so that's one thing that needs to be solved and the skills and transparency is something that also may not automatically come in in theory does because the code is open but to run a platform there's a lot more than code you also need to have the operational practices you need to have the operational tooling you need to understand how to deal with incidents all of those things is knowledge that you need to build and it is not automatically available just by having open source code and that's of course how we connect to the open operations and the operate first movement I'll talk about that in a second first of all one of the things when I said well switching needs to become easier basically we need to kind of find common ways how we build these clouds how we configure them and how they expose interfaces to the to the users and of course there's there's great existing standards out there I mean the on the open infrastructure side there's the OpenStack powered trademark certification which standardizes the the APIs how they are exposed on the CNCF world of course we have the CNCF compliance tests but looking at real workloads those are a great starting point but they're not enough I mean there's nothing standardized about how does your storage in Kubernetes for example need to look like there's well I mean the way you do whatever I'm ingress you need to have custom annotations for your load balancer so if you need to migrate applications those are the things that you really stumble upon and that are painful so we need to to create standardization together to to move forward then address that issue and then of course if you if you create common standards having a reference implementation that implements all these and that providers can take and it's it's not a black or white decision you can take certain modules from a reference implementation or you can take all of it both is possible helps of course then also for providers to have a much easier job to actually build platforms addressing the skills and transparency thing that's the the operation open operations that operate first movements that we we are working on the idea there is really that we've learned how to collaborate effectively and efficiently when building software the dev piece of our dev ops world but what we haven't done as much yet is learning how to collaborate how to share information how to work together on the ops piece of dev ops so most commonly we don't learn a lot how the application operation how the platform operation works sometimes we get some some highlights or some spotlights and that's that's quite informative but we haven't really built a practice yet of sharing that and that's something we're trying to to work on within the the open operations movement that we've also heard on before on on the operate first a project and it's it's about a number of things it's really about knowledge sharing providing transparency for example if there's an incident getting a public root cause analysis is a great thing to learn it's a culture of sharing and of course processes and tooling belong to that as well so filling that gap those gaps that's exactly the mission that the sovereign cloud stack project tries to pursue and this is kind of the the official a statement what a sovereign cloud stack project is about we want to build one platform but one platform that's not operated and built by one company that owns it but really by a community of many which standardizes it together which builds it together with which operates it together even so really trying to to build on the existing open source projects and we have a lot of really great open source technology that we can build upon combine them in a standardized way that we discuss together with the community that participates and then also build the operational practices the operation knowledge together so that's that's kind of the the three outcomes that we we produce certifiable standards the reference implementation that's of course fully open source and building the operational knowledge together so this is again about the open operations i'll skip over that so we have some time for questions left and i think now we can achieve what we wanted to achieve in the taxonomy of of digital sovereignty because we now by making it easier to run those software stacks and to to offer them we have more choice in providers so there will be there will be local possibilities switching has become easier because we have taken a further step in standardizing what workloads that run on top of your infrastructure can expect and of course we've by opening up the operational piece of the the knowledge sharing we actually built a lot more skills and a lot more we provide a lot more transparency on operations the good thing is this project exists we have been able to get a grant from the german ministry for economy almost well actually one and a half years ago is when we when we started we've been able to build up a small project team in the open source business alliance we are nine people i believe on staff right now still looking for maybe two or three more to further build this we also have some money that we can pay to partners that do development work and real development work is happening some of that of course contributing to the upstream projects that we work with some of them some of that really on on integration configuration operational topics where we do some sometimes need to build own software we have a number of active members in the community we're also working very closely with the gaya x community to make sure that the standardization on a very different level that's happening there is something that is part of of what we deliver right now we've done four releases so we do like two releases a year the reality is that it's a bit of a continuous process but then still the way our partners want to consume the software it requires us to have like releases and we do like we do two per year of them and currently we have three public clouds that are using the the reference implementation actually they are using it completely and we have a couple of projects that are underway where private clouds are built and also where existing cloud environments that pre-existed before we even started this project are starting to adopt modules from the scs work that we're doing and adopt the standards so the certification program on the standardization is also something that's currently being extended and rolled out over the next few months I have some some references we've talked about this quite a bit in public published white papers and conferences and I mean these slides have been uploaded so you can best I guess look them look those references up in the in the slides and that's already my final slide I would love if some or many or all of you join our community in any way what I would what I guess what everybody in this room already does is in some way or another contribute to digital sovereignty by working on on open source this is this is helpful thanks for doing that certainly some of us if some of the work ends up in projects that we also use like whatever the linux kernel or open stack or kubernetes or projects like black cluster api in kubernetes all of that is helpful and contribution is not just code I mean just asking questions opening issues if something doesn't work contributing to these standards documenting something all of that is is great contribution and of course if there is digital sovereignty discussions it would be great if you could actually raise the voice and say well digital sovereignty is not just complying to gdpr it needs to be it needs to go way further we need to open up the way we develop software we need to have the transparency we need to open up the way we do operate these environments that's the the open operations movement to really make sure we create this awareness and make sure also that we don't let people get away with saying well we do open source and then if you look at it it's not even an osi license or it's just like a few open source components and the rest is proprietary let's make sure we we don't let people get away with that but we fight for the real open source so that would be great and it would be great for us if some of you will will join our community we're also hiring still few positions we still also have a few more tenders that we where we want development work to be done so that's also a way to to contribute you'll not get particularly rich but of course you need to pay your developer that's all I hope you have some questions if there's a lot of questions there's also an open infrastructure meet up tonight at the roosters I've been told I will be there I will not make 1900 because I think the session in this room runs until 1900 um but maybe in 730 or 80 I'll be there I can also ask some can also ask questions there but I would love some questions right now I think we have some minutes left hi thanks a lot for the presentation and congratulations for the work you've already done actually I was wondering because you talked a lot about switching and how switching is gonna bring more sovereignty but I was wondering if we cannot even take a step further and talk about interoperability and portability in itself because I think it would bring even more if we talk about sovereignty it would bring even more opportunities for sovereignty and development of new European or alternative for non-dependency on certain technology because interoperability will allow and portability will allow you to develop niche services that would be interoperable with pretty much all other stacks right so I was wondering why stopping at switching and not go all the way you know as I mentioned before great great question um and actually um on that slide I was really kind of um answering the pain that we've heard companies talking about um actually if you look at our vision what we're trying to do is we say well actually we're building one large virtual cloud where the crash is not so much switching from one provider to another one with your workload but actually using several of them together in a federated way and because the way they are built they are so compatible so interoperable um that that actually works and it's seamless uh that that's kind of the end vision and probably it will not be achievable 100 percent because sometimes there are things like whatever network latencies that you will not be able to overcome if you federate clouds from very different locations um but I mean getting as close as possible to that vision that that's something we try to achieve and I think I didn't mention Federation specifically here but it's part of our vision hello thank you for the presentation and just trying to understand the scope of scs uh is it like only um you want to like try to standardize what is being exposed to users beyond the api's like thinking of opens like all the public open cycle because they only have the same api but of course there are some details are different so it did make sense to try to standardize that but is it also because you talk about operation and everything to try to standardize how the ops team for this public cloud deploy manage their things uh they manage their open stack cloud and if it's the case like how do you deal with all the existing public clouds that already have a lot in terms of operations that is running if they those companies want to join the initiative what are they supposed to do like uh redo the deployment with the scs stack uh or what's the idea there yeah great question again um so I think there's several options maybe first of all I mean when we say we standardize we create certifiable standards that's of course something that is at the interface towards the users the folks that deploy workloads on top of the platform and that makes the the switching or also the federating possible but then of course we have a reference implementation which is completely open source and which is modular and if you are a new provider I mean our recommendation would be well try to see whether the whole stack actually serves your purpose we're trying to to develop it together in a way that it does but if you have an existing platform that's probably not something you will do you will not switch out an existing platform if you have any reasonable amount of users on it so the our suggestion is well look if there's certain modules where we create something that you want and see if you can fit it into your existing infrastructure we're currently trying to start a project on um metering uh metrics collection uh because there's kind of a number of of of half finished projects out there which kind of need need some need some love um and that is something that as as an existing cloud provider you might be very well willing to adopt or maybe a status dashboard something that people have built on their own most of them haven't done it in a way that it's great yet doing that is something that you could adopt and then step by step of course the the closer you are to the reference implementation the more knowledge and information and also operational practices you can share with the rest of the community so the more useful I think it will be but then if you have existing infrastructure you will probably change it very gradually and that that's possible that's something that we do we have partners that we work with that follow exactly that approach thanks for thanks for presentation um how small question are you starting from scratch or are you in contact with different company to build something based on their experience behind my question um actually I I know that a lot of countries in Europe there is some regulatory conditions for financial services or government and I think that everyone is building his own certification standards uh operational model and they're building their internal cloud solution so behind the question is is there any project to collaborate with all of that companies and maybe build something tomorrow I mean the the whole idea behind this is an invitation for all those companies that build similar things based on openly stack components to say well can't we join forces and do it together and build some joint common best practices that work for all of us or I should asset it's not like a white thing you can adopt some of the some of the the pieces if you want but in the end of course we want to have one one reference implementation that all the different people that that are interested in it have contributed to and that's that's what that's that's the main reason for us to exist this kind of collect all this these little great teams that do great work but it's completely disconnected and fragmented and we try to bring that together and of course we haven't yet talked to all of them and some of them may be here about us for the first time to today but yes that that's what we're working on and we're more than open to get additional people that have built some similar things and see whether we can align them and find joint joint ways to do things yes hi um okay great story um what I'm sort of missing is the next step and and then with regards to politics uh if we look back in history that once was a thing called the docu wars you know Microsoft document liberal office etc and uh there was a certain arrogance of a certain supplier that I won't mention that there were no price negotiations as possible and then if you say that to a government official he goes back to his desk and he starts thinking okay but I'm being screwed and how can I fix this so they came up with a thing called open standards and the importance of open standards in uh uh using in in in society now what we see with the GDPR is is also a very good standard but on privacy if you talk to the people in Japan and say well what do you do with privacy laws the answer is well we look at Europe and copy that um so on that area we're in the front so in in the hyperscalers we're losing big but on standardization of privacy laws we're leading the world yeah um what you're doing now is setting a very nice standard and if you can sort of promote that standard to governments as in look the exit costs of your product and and projects will will go down if you standardize on these standards that we have developed then they will ask the uh suppliers uh it's nice that you want to sell or something but it has to apply uh by by this standard um which will give legitimacy to your standard um so are there basically after my long stall and the question would be are there plans on that direction so um I think it's a great suggestion we have some level of discussions with the german government that's just because we were operating out of that country and also have funding from the from the german ministry so some some of that is happening there yes so I think it's something we will need to address to see that we can um yeah I would love not to say it needs to be friends in Germany because I think europe is a lot more colorful than that but I know those are two key countries so yes um I'll just take that as input and think about how we can maybe start a discussion in a broader european sense I mean we have some great partnerships in sweden where actually great discussions happen talk to the the join-up task force of the EU in in brussels geysi lenis is walking around here as one of those people involved there and and and make that connection and because from that point on um uh things should start rolling because well that's their job you know to disseminate these kinds of initiatives through the other countries and the other countries are all looking for a way to make also their lives better for their constituents so um yeah I I think this is a very good initiative but it needs the political dimension yeah great input and I'll I'll try to catch you to to make sure you can establish those connections yeah sure sure no worries I'll I'll uh walk to you in a minute please so last question so uh disclaimer I work at red hat and I have a question you know how this compares to red hats uh hybrid cloud uh strategy what what do you think and it's kind of the common many of the common goals so I it's a great question um I I mean red hat does a lot of great work in a lot of the open source projects that we are also using when we're building the reference implementation and we have lots of of contacts at the working level in the end what red hat does is they are building a uh product a distribution for well open shift is a lot of the work is is based on open shift basically in red hat which is it's a nice product but what red hat doesn't really do is address like this standardization thing that red hat doesn't try to tell its customers well you should run it in a certain way so it can be federated with all the others something which is not in the scope of red hats work and I think it's great because it's not their their role to do that we're trying to establish that so we can build these federations um so it's it's really a different role uh that we have there um and then of course I like the fact that red hat has kind of invented this operate first thing when we came up with this open operation things which kind of fits together very nicely so I think there will be a lot of collaboration and I hope red hat will play a stronger role also in our project in the future thanks", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 15.76, "text": " Thanks for joining us tonight, a long day in the digital, in the
