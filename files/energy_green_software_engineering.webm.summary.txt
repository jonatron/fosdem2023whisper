The talk discusses the concept of building an ecosystem around energy measurement tools for software. The speaker introduces a hypothetical scenario where the energy consumption of operating systems and applications is transparent and readily available to developers and users. They propose the idea of comparing energy consumption in different scenarios to make informed decisions about software choices. The speaker then explains the Green Metrics Tool, a container-based approach for measuring software energy consumption, and showcases its features such as measuring different metrics, identifying energy hotspots, and detecting anomalies. They also introduce other projects like EcoCI, which focuses on measuring energy in CI pipelines, and Cloud Energy, which estimates energy in cloud environments using a machine learning model. The ultimate goal is to create a green software community that prioritizes transparency and enables developers to make informed decisions about energy consumption. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of easy and transparent energy measurement for software and the need for standard usage cases and reference machines for comparability.
