00:00.000 --> 00:19.240
Okay. So, hi, everyone. Good morning. This is so awesome. Welcome to the Kotlin Dev Room

00:19.240 --> 00:29.120
at FOSDEM 2023. Well, it's been two long years since we saw us in person. I still remember

00:29.120 --> 00:36.800
when we had the first Kotlin Dev Room in 2020 and, like, not as many people as today, like,

00:36.800 --> 00:41.920
literally, I'm impressed. Like, I think we had a bigger room and way less people, which was like,

00:41.920 --> 00:48.040
I don't know how many people will actually show up. But, yeah, today we are so many and, again,

00:48.040 --> 00:56.320
super excited to get this kicked off. And as we get this kicked off, well, I want to give

00:56.320 --> 01:03.000
out, like, a little bit of stats. First, I'm so proud to share that this year we received so

01:03.000 --> 01:11.200
many proposals for talks. We actually received more proposals than the Go Dev Room, than the

01:11.200 --> 01:29.200
Rust Dev Room, than the JavaScript Dev Room, which is happening tomorrow in the same Dev Room. And,

01:29.200 --> 01:34.440
by the way, like, if you're so much into Kotlin, make sure you don't miss tomorrow's JavaScript

01:34.440 --> 01:42.000
Dev Room opening talk by Luis. I don't know. Is Luis in the room today? He's finishing his

01:42.000 --> 01:48.080
slides. But, yeah, he will open the JavaScript Dev Room, speaking out a ditched JavaScript

01:48.080 --> 01:53.520
for Kotlin. So you definitely don't want to miss that. And so, like, a couple of other interesting

01:53.520 --> 02:01.640
talks about Kotlin also in the friends of the open JDK Dev Room tomorrow. So, check the agenda.

02:01.640 --> 02:07.480
There are, like, a lot of interesting content. So, back to the people to thank. Well, first,

02:07.480 --> 02:22.920
I want to give a big shout out to the Dev Room managers. So, thank you. It's me, Martin, Sergei,

02:22.920 --> 02:29.760
which is there, Olga and Marco. And we do these in our free time. Like, we don't get paid for that.

02:29.760 --> 02:36.280
And it's just, like, it's so awesome to get in touch with the community and hear your stories,

02:36.280 --> 02:43.240
connect with you. And, well, thanks for showing up and coming. I want to say thank you to

02:43.240 --> 02:51.560
Jabrains for supporting us. So, every speaker today will get a t-shirt. Plus, we do have some

02:51.560 --> 03:00.600
stickers and stuff to give away. So, stay tuned. But, yeah, Jabrains is supporting us in organizing

03:00.600 --> 03:07.760
this Dev Room. And I want to say thank you to the speakers, which prepared content and, yeah,

03:07.760 --> 03:19.000
just made the Dev Room possible. So, thank you very much. And, yeah, now back to Martin.

03:19.000 --> 03:28.360
So, we have a packed agenda for today with more than 15 talks. There is no, sorry, I do not get

03:28.360 --> 03:33.880
this good. Yeah. This is the agenda. So, it's available online. You can go on the FOSDEM website.

03:33.880 --> 03:41.760
You also have an Android app. I'm not sure about an iOS app. I think some, there is, okay. So,

03:41.760 --> 03:46.800
you have apps. Make sure to check it out. We have a lot of content today. And there is no

03:46.800 --> 03:54.560
lunch break at all. So, you have to organize yourself to just decide what you want to do or

03:54.560 --> 03:59.360
just bring some sandwiches. Or you can eat some waffles, too, if you want. We have free waffles.

03:59.360 --> 04:07.120
That's it. If you want more Kotlin, as Nico said, there is a talk tomorrow in the JavaScript.

04:07.120 --> 04:13.880
I mean, you have a lot of Kotlin content today and tomorrow. If you want to discuss more and have

04:13.880 --> 04:20.760
some beers, we meet tonight at the GIST. It's in the center of Brussels. The address is not here,

04:20.760 --> 04:25.960
but you can look it up on Google. And let's meet there. Just when the dev room closes,

04:25.960 --> 04:33.520
we will go there. We can meet or just meet directly there at 8 p.m. Am I doing this one?

04:33.520 --> 04:36.000
I think you're doing this one? Or am I doing, I think I'm doing this one.

04:36.000 --> 04:46.360
All right. So, like the last years, we will have a live chat on Slack. If you are not on Slack,

04:46.360 --> 04:52.440
give me a shout. Or we will have links on here. I think, Nico, you prepared. Deeplings.

04:52.440 --> 05:02.160
Pingas there. There's the Fostum room. This is, I think, the Deepling to Slack room itself. If

05:02.160 --> 05:08.560
you are not signed up yet, for whatever reason, use this link. Ask me if you need it again and

05:08.560 --> 05:14.520
you can't take a picture right now. And this is also a good place to be because, as Nico already

05:14.520 --> 05:21.760
said, we do have a couple of giveaways. Thanks to JetBrains, we have, I think, three licenses

05:21.760 --> 05:28.200
to give away. How this works, I will let you know on the Slack and on Twitter and on Mastodon.

05:28.200 --> 05:34.800
Yeah, essentially, so keep an eye on there. Ask me how this works. Essentially, if you ping me

05:34.800 --> 05:42.240
there, if you treat a post, if you two to post a picture or something. I will see you put on the

05:42.240 --> 05:49.400
hashtag Fostum Kotlin 23 or Fostum for 23, something like that. I will let you know. And you can

05:49.400 --> 05:55.520
win this one at the end of the day. I wanted to say the year would be quite a long time. I think

05:55.520 --> 06:00.720
that's it from my end. If you have any questions around this, approach me. I will be some there

06:00.720 --> 06:10.200
here or close to the coffee. Okay, fine. Yeah, prepared as always. Thank you so much for coming.

06:10.200 --> 06:24.680
Yeah. We will, yes, we will do. Good point. Yeah, here we go. Better. Excellent. Right,

06:24.680 --> 06:33.480
so then enjoy the day, have fun, network, speak to each other, cold, whatever. Enjoy.
