{"text": " We're starting now. Please. Please quiet down. Hello folks. Today we are here to talk about Fedora Corvus and how you can use that to do some fun stuff. The fun stuff being, you know, hosting your own dedicated multiplayer server so that you and your friends can have some fun. I'm joined here by Sumanthro, myself Akash Deep Dhar. We both work for Red Hat, but we are Fedora Project Contributors, and part of Fedora Council as well. So we welcome you to this talk. So about the things that we would want to talk about, the first and the foremost thing would of course be the OS, the thing that we run our containers on, and why exactly should you give a damn about it when there are like a plethora of Linux distributions out there with their own twists and turns attached to them. The next thing is of course putting that operating system to use, that of course is to have our own dedicated Minecraft server, understand how that process works and how easy or difficult it can be to actually put that to use. We'll put that to use again for the Valheim server too, because guess what? The community is great, and the folks have always created containers, and when it comes to containers, we always have something, some kind of platform to make use of. And by all means, if you trust me enough, you can totally scan this QR code, and it will lead you to the documentation, so you can totally go along with the talk, because this will be more hands-on. We'll be doing stuff over here, and we'll be making you folks understand as to what is happening behind the scenes and why exactly are we doing that. Or you can totally head over to the schedules page on the Container Step Room and find our links over there, so documentation is over there as well. Speaking of the operating system that we're going to talk about, what exactly is Fedora CoreOS? To begin with, it's a set of packages that's very minimal in nature, but it's very focused to the container-based workflows. So you won't get to see a lot of bells and whistles out of the box. Sure, there's an option to add those by yourself whenever you feel like, but then again, it's the networking, it's the container-based workflows like Moby, Podman, which I installed over there, as well as some tools like Firewall that you would need to make sure that people actually connect to your containers and be able to do what they want to do, which are pre-installed, which gives you just enough of a stuff to get started, and a canvas to actually add your own distributions, your own packages on the top of it, and grow upon it as you go on. And there's this thing called RPMOS Tree, which is based on LibOS Tree. The entire file system is transactional in nature, which essentially means that if I were to add packages on the top of the existing deployment, well, an existing set of installed packages, I can do so by ease without actually worrying that, oh, what's going to happen if I add this bleeding edge package? Will my deployment stop failing to work? And if it does, you can always find your way back. It's a Git kind of a workflow, so if you understand Git, it's pretty much like that, so you can always rebase your deployments, your own set collection of packages at any point in time, and just fall back at any point in time you want to go back to. The next thing is the fact that this is secure as well as scalable. So we, of course, would like to have this not only deployed in bare metal servers, but as well in a plethora of VMs having their own set of purposes. Now, the way we do that is by the use of configuration, and it's kind of difficult that you need to configure like tens of thousands of machines with hand, so guess what? You don't. You use something called beauty in configuration, which is a human readable form of something called ignition, and what it exactly does is you specify what kind of change that you want to make on that operating system. Some users that you want to add, some files that you want to make create, some networking rules, firewall rules, services to start stuff like that. You can do so so that when in the first boot, you get the operating system exactly the way you want, so you don't really have to install stuff and then configure it and then do that like thousands of times just because scalability is the thing. The next thing that I want to talk about is the fact that this operating system is available in not just x86 underscore 64, but in a lot of other places, architectures such as AR64 and ST90X as well, and we plan on providing the support for other operating systems architectures in the coming times. Speaking of the minimal set of packages, how minimal is it that we're talking? Let's give that a number. So we have like three release sets, the one for stable, the testing, as for us next, they are determined by the number at the penultimate decimal place, so 3.0 is stable, 2.x is testing, and 1.x is next. And you can totally see what those purposes are for and why exactly would someone want to go for a next over stable or vice versa. So say for instance, if there's a contributor who wants to develop this thing, they want to test all the bleeding edge packages that comes to this platform, they know what they can choose, and for the ones who really want to set up a server for their home people, they don't really want to move around a lot of stuff. They can either go for stable or they can reach out to our friends at CentOS because they have a CentOS team called OS2. So how exactly does this operating system become secure and scalable? I mean, I do sure like giving a business pitch because it's all buzzwords. So there are ways to make sure that the packages that you have installed or to say layered on the top of your existing installation, the way it gets automatically updated is very much in your control, which essentially means that it can go out in the open, start downloading everything, every new and bleeding edge stuff if you ask it to, or just hold back on it just because you want a stable operating system, you want to really curate the packages that you end up having so you have a lesser variness to updates that you end up having. So it's totally in your control and by all means there are ways to totally disable automated updates as and when you see fit. And these updates for the packages that you have installed, these don't get applied as soon as they get installed, but rather you kind of make those applications of those updates when you want them to happen. Usually it's a reboot because, well, the service actually happens to go through all the packages and refresh them based on the updates that has happened in the last boot, but you can always do it either live or in the next time as well. So at any point in time you feel like that a certain update has gone through which should not have, you can rest assured because that has not yet applied and you can always fall back to the previous deployment. And oh, I just happened to explain the last point. So that is rolling back whenever you feel like it. So depending on how you want to use this, you can use it on a Raspberry Pi if you are having one on your shelf gathering dust or you can have multiple VMs of yours on that desktop of yours that you think is an overkill and you don't use it anything else other than gaming. And of course there are choices to use it on the cloud too, which we totally suggest because this is something that we want to deploy on scale. So the kind of replicated deployment that you can have kind of depends on the kind of purpose that you would want to use this for. Right. So that's basically about operating system itself. Now we're going to make that thing, put that thing into use and understand how we can do some fun stuff, you know, set ourselves up an environment on this laptop itself. I set myself up a virtualization host and I'll configure it to the way I want it to. So if I want a user, I'll add it there. If I want a server to run in a certain way, maybe allow for no more than 32 people, I'd do so too. And by all means here again, this is a thing that you can follow along. So you can feel free to read the documentation by scanning the QR code and we'll move on to the next one. Right. So the set up environment that we have in place is VMware workstation. We really wanted to make sure that things are a lot more easier and off-limited scope for scope of this presentation. But you can use Quemu, you can use virtual box, you can use anything that you want or if you want to just nail it, you really want to make use of a bare metal too. And the specification that we provided it for are listed over here and for this case just because we want a server that actually runs, that actually is something that won't get a lot of packages, a lot of updates down the line, we really want to make sure that this runs in the long term, we have approached the stable stream for this one. Right. So I'm going to exit out of the screen for a bit and go more into detail about the stuff that I talked about over here. Right. So speaking of the demonstration, I have an entire directory of files that I need. Now these can either be firewall rules, the system, the units that I want to enable on the first boot, the packages that I want to install, the configuration for the swap that I want to put into place, stuff like that. So to get started, like I mentioned, we required a butane configuration. Now what exactly would that be? Let's find out. Pute cons and of course mine.pu. Well, basically it's just a list of directives that lets you do the stuff that you want to make happen. So if you want to create users with the set password for them, add SSS authorized keys, stuff like that, you can have them over here. The same goes for the stories, the symbolic links that you want to make happen from one folder to another directory. And you can have files that you source from a remote location and place it to somewhere else. Then finally we get to the system, the units part, where you can actually declare services. Now these services can either be for installing packages, adding firewall rules, enabling containers, stuff like that, and you can totally control them the way you want. And finally, you know, there's this cadence about what needs to be done first that you can use with the use of system D directives, like before, depends on, but you can also mention them over here. Right. So as you can see that we have roughly three system D units that we have mentioned over here. The first, of course, is to install portman compose and firewall D. We have portman pre-installed but not portman compose, so we might as well end up getting one. And the next is to allow Minecraft server to firewall. So before that we, of course, would reboot because like I mentioned, your updates only get applied when you want them to be applied, which by this case, by the default is reboot. There's also an option to apply them live, but then again you'd want to use them for applications like, well, a text editor or something of that kind, but definitely not for something that will end up becoming a service on itself. And then finally starting the dedicated server, now that the stuff that we needed for the firewall D service rules are everything in place. So just to avoid using more time during the presentation, what we did was, well, we did that in the hindsight like previously. And now what we have over here is the IP that we can connect to the container, the one that's running firewall D, the one that runs that firewall D service as well as the Minecraft dedicated server. To go forward in detail, I would show the status of the units that I mentioned off, like those for allowing these and depending on what kind of condition that you make happen, you can either make them run once, like if the firewall D service has been enabled, so you don't want to enable it again. So you can always put a flag of some kind telling that if a certain condition satisfies, which it seems to have, it won't run again. So the next thing that I want to show you is, of course, the server itself. So if I were to follow a certain unit, let's just say start Minecraft server, but I'm going to save myself some effort and go like that. So we have this container right here that's running on Podman. And yeah, there's this internal IP address as well that lets us connect to that. And finally, about the services that lets you install both Podman Compose as well as the firewall D. We'll head over here. Where's the terminal? There it is. And do, of course, mine. It's just a moment. And allowing system D system, allowing Minecraft server to the firewall. So we have set also the condition which tells that once that thing is done, you create a file called done, allow Minecraft server to firewall. So with the services like these, we kind of make sure that the service runs exactly when we want it to and not any time more than that. So once it's done, it's done. And of course, the condition for setting up in the first boot kind of falls in line for the one that helps us install these packages, especially for the Podman Compose and firewall D. So condition for the first boot is true, but you reboot after this thing has completely done. And by that, we help applying these packages on the existing deployment. Right. Let's say we'll go over here and we'll check the IP address again. This happens to be, this is not forwarded. So as much as any of you folks have Minecraft installed, I'm really sorry that you folks won't be able to connect to this one for the security purposes. But I'm going to connect to it and see what kind of world it gets me into. So we have the IP 192.168.234.129. Let's see if it's reachable. Well, actually it's kind of a firewall D thing if it's the service runs. And if the rules have been applied, we would be able to. Hmm, just a moment folks. Oh, it seems to have run. Now to have a plan B and a plan C, I have heard stories of folks losing their presentations. They have like three flash drives. So I also thought of deploying one in my home, but we probably won't need that because guess what? We have a sour that says that it's running on this host and it's running on, well, the forced and set up that we have here. Well, the other one, the plan C, of course, does not happen to be a plan C anymore because there's something that I can't reach out to. So I'm going to connect over to this one. Right. So the worst thing that can happen to a player when the entire Minecraft world has happened. But then again, if I were to all tab out and were to check the logs of the service, I should be able to see that I indeed have connected and have reached. So, you know, folks can totally get creative with what they can do with this. They can have their own servers hosted on their local place, maybe have an OCI cloud to do some reverse proxing to have their friends connect to it as well. The possibilities are endless. And when it gets deployed on scale on cloud, it just goes to the next level. And it's not just for gaming, but rather for if you want to do a local deployment for Plex or anything for that matter, which uses containers, it is possible. Now I'm going to hand it over to Sumanthro to be able to talk about the Valheim setup, say, back to the presentation. Or to you, Sumanthro. Hey, guys. So exactly much like the Minecraft setup, we have the Valheim setup, which is basically setting up the environment variables, configuring the host, making it work. Technically all the documentation has been put out on that QR code. So, if I go over here. Yeah, so all the required files has been put out here. So, like Akash explained, we have a buton conf. So, if I go inside, you would have a buton conf configuration generated by this ignition file. So, if you look at it over here, the buton conf configuration has the storage, the directories, and all we need the files, any rules. And finally, the system D unit services that needs to run, specifically in much like the exact case of Minecraft. If I go back, this is actually the ignition file. This is the back door of how CoreOS would basically look at that configuration and parse it for its own purposes. So, this is perfectly mission readable, not supposed to be edited by hand. But, you know, if you guys wanted to change something, that's supposed to be on the buton side of things. Coming back to the configuration, there's a root. There's supposed to be ETC system D and then the ZRAM generator service. And this one is swap on ZRAM service. By default, we have put a ZRAM zero as the default setting. It requires a bunch of RAM and we literally have put one of those services over there just to ensure things are going fine. Going back to my systems, there are going to be a server through the firewall. That's exactly the same. If I open it, that's a very basic, that's a very basic thing. Going back, we have the start well dedicated service and this one is going to have the podman compose parts and that's an execute script with the up and down. Coming back to the point, so one more thing, we actually hosted it on private servers back in the home. The way that we kind of can get it up and running right now is reaching, where was the terminal? Go ahead. So for the interest of time. I should probably practice turning on microphones before speaking. For the interest of time, what we'll do is we'll just not show the Valheim demo. Unfortunately, apologies for that. But this is totally reachable on the VM that we have set up over here and the port that it goes on is reachable. But the point being that these things are very possible, fun stuff and kind of gives you a reason why you would want to try a new workflow where the entire file system, the entire packaging workflow is nothing but a get kind of a thing. So you can always roll back, roll front, depending on what you want to do. And the best thing that you can do is, well, try it out today if you have a VM to spare or a device to do say. Right. So that's about it for the presentation. We'd really love to have your questions and answer them too. We have a bunch of time for questions. So thank you very much for your presentation. I had a question about the relationship between Fedora Core, Fedora Core OS and persistent storage. My understanding is that when you're working in containers, you want everything to be ethereal and temporary and don't worry about that. But like you mentioned, if you have some sort of media server, how would you address that sort of like persistent sort of ButterFS data pool? Is that part of butane or how is that configured and managed? The way we have it is by setting up mounts. The way it works is anything that gets affected by the installation, removal, updating of the packages, these are the ones that are very transient in nature. So these can get affected. But if you have mounts that lead to some different place, they most likely won't be, the home directory would most likely stay untouched. So as long as it does not have anything to do with a certain package, if it's not a file that gets introduced when you install a package or something of that kind, it for most likely won't be touched and it would always stay the safe. Any more questions? Okay. What is the relationship between 4.0.x and 4.0.i.o.t? And does it make any sense? Has everyone got that? What's the difference between Fedora CoreOS and what? Fedora IoT. So for the record, Fedora IoT was an official edition for a long time, which means Fedora would push in updates regularly. CoreOS recently became an edition which is a release back, which now brings into question the release criteria for IoT and the boards that we support. They were very officially declared as supported. But in case of CoreOS, there's no such official support that was given before. It was never made an edition. So that's one thing that you're missing out on. Second thing that you're missing out on is IoT, on the other hand, is released every six months with the release. Fedora in CoreOS, in this case, would have a stream cycle, which means the next would be if today we get a next stream, in 15 days that would become testing, and then in next 15 days it would become the stable. And then that's how it's going to roll. Obviously, given the fact that the next stream is tested by the CoreOS's own CI, which runs for almost all the basic tests which is required for the thing to run, both are based out of OS free. But again, every 15 days, CoreOS updates to the next stream or moves through the next stream. In case of IoT, you get it every six months. Hi, thanks for the talk. I would love to see this kind of bootstrapping of CoreOS happening on SystemDN spawn, for instance. Would that be feasible, like having that butane declarative way of just instantiate me something under SystemDN spawn? Is that something that can work already? It technically can. But then again, we kind of have to understand if SystemDN spawn, well, the environment inside of it will have SystemDN or not. So it's very much possible. And one of the use cases that I've seen using it is building packages or testing them for that matter. So the very fact that, you know, you don't really have to configure it when it's up, but rather decide how it's going to look like from the get-go, and that deployment can be replicated like anywhere. So that really makes it a prime image of some kind. And it does not even have to be a container image, right? That thing can be based upon and using a virtual machine or SystemDN spawn, as you mentioned, you can have that kind of a blueprint. But guess what? It's not a container. It's a full-blown operating system, which is running like it would on a bare-metal node. Okay. Thank you. Okay. This is the last question we can take. So I was wondering this ignition file is only applied on the first startup. Can we make some kind of declarative configuration for Silver Blue? Or for, and not for Silver Blue for CoreOS? Is this also supported? So if I get your question correctly, you are wondering if a certain configuration can be run again if I want to, on the same deployment. Right. So it's totally possible. You know, the thing that you end up getting after running these many steps after running the butane configuration is a deployment. So what you can do is you can use that deployment and run a butane configuration on the top of it. So that becomes your base deployment. And anything that you add on the top of it is the resulting deployment. So the very thing that deployment states in this case is a state in which the operating system is in right now. So, yeah. So if you just mangle the state to create a new one, that state becomes your existing state. That's about it. One last thing, guys. We have a Fedora boot. Feel free to go there, grab swags and whatnot. And thanks for attending. Thanks. Hey, guys.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.76, "text": " We're starting now. Please.
