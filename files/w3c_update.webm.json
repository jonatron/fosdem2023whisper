{"text": " Yeah, yeah, yeah, and just shout if I'm raining out the time Yeah, yeah, great Hello everyone, hello, I'm gonna start So thank you for being here. I'm glad to open that dev room It's my first time at first them So I'm very happy to be here in front of you and I ask you to be kind because I'm not used to present that much All right, and I'm open to feedback afterward Just come and see me tell me how to improve. I would be very very happy to hear you Okay, my talk is about to breathe three C Do you know to breathe three C? Who knows that raise your hand? Okay? That was an easy question for everybody to raise their hand, right? It's a worldwide organization Everybody knows it the different standards and it's quite far from us, right? You don't know exactly what happened in that organization there's big names and Serious people around the table discussing things and eventually they agree on something that applies to the market and They've got some working group and there was one there is working group one working group, which is about We're about to see okay who works with web RTC in the room Okay, that's great. That was also an easy question in the in the room will time communication, right? So there is one working group that defined the standards for us on the market so I thought that it was quite interesting to understand how it works and what are the topics and Maybe how to get involved into it so that the future is built by us, right? we are kind of part of the community and the W3C is about getting the community to reach consensus so it makes sense to be around the table so In fact first I was interested to know more about that organization and I think that it could be interesting for you, too By the way, I'm Romain I work for a company like everybody right I And I've got I'm co-organizer at death fest in my City Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's asleep. All right. Good back And I was so co-organizer at a meetup that will soon revive which is called the web RTC Paris meetup Soon revive because it's been asleep for a few months few years in fact And so connect with me if you want to talk about those topics, of course You can reach me on twitch every Thursday Also Right, so I talked about that they there was been a standard that enables all the Industry to agree on a protocol. Let's call the web RTC standard and it came only in 2021 so it's very late in fact if you are in the water to see industry for a while You use that protocol quite from out for a long time. It's not big in Twenty twenty one is not the beginning. It's kind of the end. So that's kind of what W3C is is making sure that we agree on something stable. So from that moment you can build on Solid foundations your applications using web RTC and that's why it's quite interesting What is quite interesting also is that it's a it's a coupled action across W3C and also IETF So do we see the for like kind of the web like the usage of it and The other organization is more about how you structure the protocol the networking protocol that Enable the thing to flow across the clients So that's that's quite interesting to join force on that particular topic So they need to agree together like the working group in at W3C need to agree also with the working group The EETF. I don't know how to pronounce that anyway So yeah, happy we've got a standard But in fact, there is a lot of use case that use cases that are already on the market so What is the working group? Doing so that's work group. The W3C work group. They do they accept any individual to contribute to participate They also encourage anyone at any company anyone any company or any organization to become a member All right, they So as a as an organization, you might be our end user I mean, I'm sorry a company that be a solution based on that protocol or you can be also a browser editor for example You can propose new standards So that's quite powerful if you remember you can propose new standards and as it's based on consensus if your proposal is a need on the market, you will have a community that will Gather around you and then finally you can reach that consensus. Otherwise if your proposal is not Needed or is not appropriate. You will suddenly have rejection from the community or Or just nobody around you. So you can't reach consensus if there is nobody around you, right? So that's how it works. It's kind of democratic in fact It's having people gathering and trying to get better together. I Each working group has a leaders. So at the W3C The sorry the web RCC working group. We've got leaders from Microsoft and Mozilla and Can't remember the third one like the big players maybe Google or maybe or not I can remember anyway, so the big players are the leaders and the leaders is Being a leader is a role that involves you to Push forward the the group without taking Directions, so you need to provide energy to the group. You need to Make the whole process to go on and on make sure that there is a real consensus around the table and Trying to in the end a Realize the mission of the working group So The web RTC Working group have some topics so they they worked on Different topics in the past we can have some mature topics that are already deployed in in the different solutions different brothers brothers and So you can recognize that those API that you might use every day so you can see that those API's are Worryingly accept. They are silly. They are fundamental in fact So you can build on that and there is also there are also some topics that are still in discussion More or less mature, but still in discussion and those are still moving things, right? You can see quite interesting topics in there Especially topics that are Optimization for having better quality co-quality video quality In in your application, so it's like more technical things and also things that are more related to the UX How you will make the UX better when you handle the Communication through the web RTC API implemented in the browsers, for example, you've got like for example this one the capture handle This is what Something quite interesting. It's like have it making sure that when you are in a tab in a browser And then you share another tab in the browser that the two tabs are aware of each other So that you can know that you are sharing a tab on a specific domain, for example so that you can adapt your behavior as a as a web RTC Application you can adapt the behavior of your application Depending on what is shared and the contrary also is when you share when we when as a tab is shared the tab knows That is actually streaming the content some somewhere else So you might also adapt the content of the tab depending on that So that that's quite interesting, right? We haven't thought of that quite quite often and Those topic has been raised by Members of the working group. So if you want to raise a topic you can you can do it the way about to see working group is As a statement that defined its mission and in fact in that statement that fundamental statement They try to see what are the use cases that want to reach and that's also given a glance of what should be What could be the way about to see API in the future or what could be done through that API? So for example, okay fire cherry, that's great use case. You've got like I don't know what how I would wait Sorry, I don't know What it's so so used the funny hats use case which brings a lot of technical Challenges around that and I was so like bringing resources from the browser to You get involved into the web artist your protocol and and the rendering of the videos And you've got those things that are trendy All these things about analysis of the voice and also the image They call that face, but we can too maybe a lot a broader perspective with saying well, how do we do the? The analyzes how do we bring value to what is gone through the? Channel offered by web RTC How do we had some? Intelligence on top of that So that's in the road map You might already do that in your application trying to make sure that it's quite stable Using the API that could be provided by your browsers like chrome chromium or Firefox or I don't know which one is Safari and try to try to make sure that it's quite violent. I mean You try to cover the gaps So, you know that if it's still in discussion as a As a standard it might move in the in the future All right, we've got all the other use cases like low latency broadcast with P2P release That's quite that was quite a topic I think and that's a technical changes which is very high But you know that it's something that is that might be addressed by the the working group in the near future So how do you contact how you do getting for how do you engage with the working group? So that's kind of the API of the working group And they've got a website. There is plenty of things. It's it's it's an institution, right? It's an organization for standardization. So it's like quite massive amount of text, right? But there is also a monthly discussion so that you can just drop by it's Broadcasted on YouTube so you can drop by and listen to the topic that are Currently discussed. It's quite technical topics, right? But it's very interesting to know how it works like the process of getting a consensus You've got some samples that you can try on the future implementation. So you've got those topics that are still in the discussion and When you go through that process and at the kind of the end of the processes They try to get to release some sample. What should be what what they the standard should like look like when you use that in the browser? Oh Use it like not only in the browser, but most of the samples are in browsers And finally, there is a massive amount of group a working group repository. It's mainly repositories for For handling the modifications of documents as you want to progress as a standard you need to agree on a Formal documentation of the standard and in fact those reapers are mostly used for making sure that everyone that has an issue Can raise a point and then the point can be discussed and a proposal can also be but don't through that through that Through those reapers if you are only a participant not a member you can you can go into that discussion Okay, you can propose things You don't have the voice, you know, it's not like your voice is not as powerful as if you were a member But in fact you can drop your ideas and and for having discussed discussed with them. They're quite open with a different point of view And especially when you are a user of those technologies, they are kind to have some feedback on what they're proposing How to engage there is a massive event from the the W3C and that is happening in Sevilla, which is quite near. I mean It's not I mean, it's quite the place It would be in September next year And there is also a Mailing list and an IRC channel how to contribute They are promoting the thing that you use GitHub for For any any Suggestion they want to track everything. It's a distributed decentralized Working group, so they want things to be written so that also it's precise and So that it could be discussed discussed afterward in in a meeting You can propose new topics if you want for example, I talked about starting something about Energy conception and we're about to see that might be good also to understand how we impact the energy conception of all the client devices and also maybe in the networks across to understand What is our impact on developing new features? How and trying to get that into the balance when you choose adding new features? And if you want to get more info, I'm not yeah, yeah, I'm about it. That's the last slide I'm about to Sorry, sorry, so I'm not from the W3C. Okay, just for you to know But you can reach out those people and they are dedicated staff for the web at the C working group They are very friendly. They are open for discussion. They can also bring you on the on the boat So just reach out to them and you can find those slides in my github account Thank you. Hey just in time Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, right Join me on every Thursday at the work RTC wildcard show. It's on twitch. Thank you Any question No, yes Yeah Me me myself no nothing No, in fact, so so there is no as far as I know I'm went through I went through a A lot of reports for of what is happening in the in the working group and I've not seen much thing about decentralized messaging But if you want to start something about that they are okay for getting some up Yeah Any question Thank you Thank you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.8, "text": " Yeah, yeah, yeah, and just shout if I'm raining out the time", "tokens": [50364, 865, 11, 1338, 11, 1338, 11, 293, 445, 8043, 498, 286, 478, 18441, 484, 264, 565, 50954], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5359678268432617, "compression_ratio": 1.0714285714285714, "no_speech_prob": 0.6733101606369019}, {"id": 1, "seek": 3000, "start": 30.0, "end": 32.0, "text": " Yeah, yeah, great", "tokens": [865, 11, 1338, 11, 869], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3147019161267227, "compression_ratio": 1.5743589743589743, "no_speech_prob": 0.13778012990951538}, {"id": 2, "seek": 3000, "start": 34.32, "end": 37.02, "text": " Hello everyone, hello, I'm gonna start", "tokens": [2425, 1518, 11, 7751, 11, 286, 478, 799, 722], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3147019161267227, "compression_ratio": 1.5743589743589743, "no_speech_prob": 0.13778012990951538}, {"id": 3, "seek": 3000, "start": 38.64, "end": 42.72, "text": " So thank you for being here.
