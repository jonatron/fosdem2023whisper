The speaker introduces PGSTATV, a new Postgres extension and utility pair, which is minimalist and only focuses on time series analysis and visualization of Postgres internal statistics. PGSTATV is based on the KISS and UNIX philosophies, helping to keep it simple, minimal, and unobtrusive. Components of PGSTATV include the Postgres extension and the Python utility that retrieves stored snapshots from the database and creates simple visualizations using matplotlib. The utility can be used by super users but only requires PG monitor role privileges. Modules of the utility include buff, which shows statistics on the background writer and buffers written to disk, cache hit ratio, checkpoint rate, connections, number of tuples, weights, wall generation, and more. The utility can be installed via pip install PGstatvis and is compatible with a variety of scheduling and maintenance tools. The PGSTATV project is available on GitHub.
