The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about an accessibility project called Cache the World and how performance is being monitored and measured. The speakers discussed the scoping context for accessibility in Firefox, the rendering and accessibility architecture, the challenges with the current architecture, and the solution of introducing a cache in the parent process. They also talked about how they are measuring performance, including using profile markers and different metrics, and shared their future work plans. The Q&A section touched on topics such as security considerations and guidelines for optimizing web content accessibility.
