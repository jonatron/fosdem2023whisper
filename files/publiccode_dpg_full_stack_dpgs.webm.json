{"text": " Thank you everyone for coming. Today, Justin and I will be talking about full stack digital public goods at the start of this dev room. We went through a very brief what digital public goods and digital public good alliances, but we will also be going into depth again for those who are not aware. We want to start with our introduction. The recap of what digital public good is and the context around it, what we mean by full stack digital public good and also levels of scale that digital public good, how can they be full stack and where does the community participate in that? So who are we? Your first speaker, me, Vipalsiddharth, I work at UNICEF as open source technical advisor and have been contributing to Fedora project for almost one third of my life. And I love making coffee, maybe not drinking so much because of the anxiety. And then we have Justin. Hey everyone, my name is Justin. Today I'm working with Red Hat as a community architect for the Fedora project. But in a past life, I was also at UNICEF working in the Office of Innovation, not directly with the digital public goods alliance, which we'll tell you a little bit about in a minute, but around the DPG ecosystem of projects and many different organizations that are all engaged and working around this big topic of digital public goods. So even though I'm not still with UNICEF today, neither of us are really directly representing our employers, but we're coming more as fellow free software activists and open source fans and sharing some of our thoughts around, you know, when we have a standard around these kinds of important things around public goods, maybe there's something that's still a missing ingredient. And that's what we'll tell you a little bit more about. And yes, I'm still using buying CDs and ripping them with all free software tools, a little old school there, but I'll pass it over to Vipal for a quick recap for folks who weren't here on DPG. Yeah, so we are going to do a quick refresher on four things today, three things. What is a digital public good standard? What digital public good alliance is? And how UNICEF Venture Fund acts as a digital public good pipeline? So let's start quickly. How is a DPG defined? We'll look at the DPG standard, which is maintained by digital public good alliance. So at the heart of digital public goods, there are main three components. A digital public good comes with certain promises, promises of open source licensing, platform independence, transparency in decision making and the roadmap. But also it aims to advance the sustainable development goals by United Nations, which is addressing social or environmental issues and strive to ensure accessibility, affordability and equity, equitable distribution of the technologies through sustainable development goal relevance. And the tools do not do any harm. There are different relevant best practices that tools have to follow. So they can be open source software, content, models or documentations even. As long as they're there to relevant best practices, they do not harm and they push SDGs ahead. They are eligible for digital public good. We believe such goods, such tools needs to be identified, recognized and supported because their capacity to help achieve our goals. So those three components expand into nine different indicators that we have. Starts with relevance of sustainable development goals, licensing, platform independence, but also it should have good documentation, data that is accessible, a commitment for standards, best practices for privacy and security and demonstrate that components do not do harm. In order to become a digital public good, it's quite simple. You nominate your software, content, model. There's a technical review against all those nine indicators that we spoke about. And if it all matches, then you are listed on the registry which is an application to list all digital public good solutions that can be further looked into. Now we want to look at what digital public good alliance is. So it's a multi-stakeholder alliance founded by UNICEF, government of Norway, government of Sierra Leone and iSpirit. And it has a mission to, as we discussed, accelerate attainment of DPG's sustainable goals, especially in low and middle income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use and investment in DPGs. And one of the core functionalities of DPGA, which is the alliance, is to maintain the standards of DPG. How do we recognize as tool? Today, this is a public good association alliance has grown a lot, started by four, but now we have many more. And if you attended the keynote yesterday, the latest edition is open source initiative in the alliance. Finally, we are going to look into how UNICEF Venture Fund acts as one of the pipelines to funnel more DPGs into it. Now, it may be weird to think that UNICEF acts as a venture capital, a small portion of it, but we invest in early-stage companies, solutions that have a working prototype with a lot of promising results. They match with our goals of doing good for children women, improving our sustainable development goals for UN. And so our main idea is that we take risks in emerging technology that may work or also identifying what does not work. Early investment can accelerate our finding of good with using technology that we have not found yet. So far, we have invested in 128 companies across 75 countries and this number is growing because we just invested four more last month. And I think another country is added to it. We are very concerned about the diversity of the female, just founders of the companies and how many countries we are touching, their levels of development. And we invest in technologies like drones, also blockchain, AI, data science, VR, a lot of this emerging technology that we have yet to see impact directly. Some of them are doing it. That's where they lie in this graph, but our goal is to identify what's not been proven yet. And last, how does the UNICEF open source, where does open source part comes in? Because at the heart of digital public good, there's open source. And the way UNICEF identifies this company is three ways that it must different. First of all, the investment is equity free. We do not take any equity from them. So almost like a grant, but we have certain contracts, certain expectations, milestones to achieve. And the core of it is open source. Any solution that UNICEF invest in that must be open source, ideally at the start of it, or by the end of investment round, it must be a open source solution. And not just with open source license, but have all those indicators that we just discussed, must have good licenses, must have a public roadmap, a place where you can open and report issues. So, and other way that's very unique is that UNICEF provides mentors who will work with companies to help them develop. We have business mentors, we have software development mentors, and the place where I come in is open source mentorship in making sure that we are following the right practices. So far, out of 127 or 129 as per last yesterday that I saw, at least 16 of those companies come from UNICEF, where we have guided them, helped them achieve certain standard and now they are digital public goods. And at least that I'm working with 15 companies that are planning their nominations within the next few months. And now I'll pass it to Justin to talk about what we mean by full stack digital public goods. So earlier, like Vipple talked about, there's that nine point standard, which goes a long way on building on this, you know, open source base. We talk a lot about licenses in the open source world. But if you look around us, there's still all these other parts that are very important and often don't get factored in as with as much emphasis as maybe we focus on like copy left or permissive. So the digital public good standard does a good takes good steps forward of trying to provide more of a framework around how we can look at a digital solution and its impact on again, like the sustainable development goals, but also sustainable as an open source product or open source project. So what does this full stack piece mean? So first, understand that this isn't something that's in the standard. This isn't something that's been published by UNICEF or Red Hat. This is just something that Vipple and I have thought about as we've been working with these companies and teams from all over the world, like you saw on that map, people who are often approaching these open source business models and challenges with building a community for the very first time. So we've noticed some things that come up a lot across these mentoring that we were running with these companies and these teams. So this concept of a full stack DPG is something that we made up for this talk to help identify a possible gap in today's DPGs and one possible way that we can address it. So let's look at four challenges with the current DPG standard and then identify what this concept of a full stack DPG is. So first, the DPG standard is indeed a standard that's been reviewed and has a change process, but the actual review process itself is not quite standardized. There are indicators in the standard that give some guidelines around what you should look for around documentation, what licenses are acceptable thanks to the open source initiative. And we have other kinds of things like, you know, for adhering to data privacy and best practices, making sure that wherever the product is based or if it's a company, where they're registered, they're in line with any local laws and requirements that are obligated to them. But while the indicators provide guidelines for whether they're satisfied, again, that review process itself remains without a common standard. We take kind of a best effort approach to dig into a product when they come and submit their nomination and understand, are they meeting these indicators? Have they taken the right efforts to address these parts of the standard? But as it is today, only the DPG Alliance can truly reproduce a review. So if a different organization attempted to review, maybe unlike some very specific indicators, like the ones that are more loosely defined, like maybe documentation, possibly even the ones around do no harm, because that's a worthwhile thing to try to standardize. But that's also really hard to try to think about all these different ways that something could be used. I mean, we can even look at the last history of 20, 30 years of open source and even ways that this is spun off in different directions. So where I'm going with this, it may depend on the level of consultation that's sought out and what backgrounds people are bringing to the table when they're going through that review process. And also how closely you're following a legal strictness, like what level of adherence you're paying attention to when you do that review. So while the standard does provide guidelines around what we're looking for in a sustainable, healthy, open source project and community, not every indicator provides an easy policy decision. There's no binary here, like yes, this is do no harm. Yes, you are in line with the sustainable development goals. We have indicators, but there's no fixed standard. It's not binary. So it doesn't always provide an easy policy decision or firm rules for proving itself as satisfied. And of course, that can also change over time. So will this will a technology stand the test of time, true of not just of digital public goods, but truly of any open source project, you'll see a lot of conversations around supply chain in the open source space today, also relevant to digital public goods. So will something stand the test of time? Will these newer ideas last into the decades ahead of us as we go into this new era of free software in these 2020s? The answer varies from DPG to DPG. Some DPGs are accomplishing their goals with ubiquitous frameworks. They're used by several projects and they have a very solid base that's maintained by a wide community. Others of them take a new approach to solving a problem in an innovative, but perhaps unproven way. So meeting the DPG standard only applies to the submitted product itself, but it does not necessarily mean looking upstream at the building blocks that are chosen by that specific project. Sometimes this is actually really beneficial because we might have these new ideas that are emerging in the field and take a new approach to an old problem and make ties into that innovation piece. But sometimes it also means that unforeseen risk will emerge. So simply this question is something that Vipple and I believe cannot be firmly answered by the DPG standard alone, at least in its current version. So again, on this whole part of funding and financial sustainability, a big piece here, DPGs don't necessarily come with a promise about their funding or their financial stability. It's not always clear when a DPG is very well funded and supported or when it's still early on and that maybe you've seen that innovation bell curve, the early adopters and the laggards. It's not always clear where a product might be in that innovation curve. So this is perhaps by design, but without better guidance for these downstream consumers of the DPG registry that we talked about earlier where you can find a huge list of digital public goods. It's hard to know as a consumer whether you're choosing an enterprise grade open source platform or you're going with an emerging cutting edge platform that may come with some adoption risk. The point is not to say that every DPG needs to have some endowment and guaranteed funding from the start, but it should be easier as consumers of DPGs to know what grade of a DPG you're working with when you're shopping the market for an open source platform. So change of ownership, change of direction. As with any private sector company, a change of ownership can mean a significant change of direction. Now the DPG standard does have in the third indicator a requirement that you demonstrate clear ownership of the tool or the product, that copyright is managed, that the person submitting the DPG actually can represent the material, the intellectual property that is being nominated. So there's steps to make sure that you're not using some other bits and pieces of other people that you don't have the legal rights to, which kind of comes into the, again, kind of the supply chain piece a little bit. But if you look at the very recent history in tech acquisition, in the tech acquisition world, it may support this notion that sometimes things change and might put what was once a very stable platform or product in a very different direction. But if this happens to a DPG, what will it mean to downstream consumers who are maybe taking certain trusting in part of the DPG standard to find a reliable thing that they can build some infrastructure or some tool on? So while it might be standard practice in the private sector for a pivot when hands change, it doesn't have to be this way for DPGs. So we would say that sustainability for the DPG standard should include greater protections if there is an unexpected change of hands and a DPG pivots in a way that goes against the standard. This could result in a new form of vendor lock for customers using an open source platform that might be later forked to a proprietary model. We don't want that. And in the worst case, the merit of having more IP under open source licenses provide greater assurance that maintenance on an open source platform is feasible. So where do we go from here? Do we need some kind of indicator around sustainability? How do we measure that? Sadly, this talk is not coming with some magic solution around how we patch sustainability. We can definitely have some conversations. But, but we have a pathway. We have some ideas and we hope to actually inspire curiosity about how sustainability should be measured in the context of a digital public good. So we wonder what does an indicator for sustainability mean? What might it look like? So this is what we propose would make a DPG into a full stack DPG. So this very draft version of this concept is that the DPG is with enhanced visibility to their operational stability in their applicability for downstream consumers in various parts of the innovation life cycle. Going back to what we said earlier, sometimes you're really looking for that, that very stable platform, something that you can guarantee has a strong base, a strong foundation, has that, that good support. And sometimes you're looking for that, that very support. And sometimes you're looking to take some risk and try a new idea to solve a problem that the existing solutions that have that proven base may not be able to address. And this is where I'll pass to Vipple to talk a little bit. Well, we'll be back and forth on this one a bit to think around like, how are ways that we could try to promote this idea of sustainability into digital public goods? What are these other things we can do perhaps around the standard to enable this idea of sustainability and helping people know what they're getting into when they find a DPG? So I'll pass. Thank you. So we believe to build early, to build sustainable DPGs, early stage investment and community and resources are the key, inclusive and diverse community, collaborations, transparencies, how they evolve and occasional revision of the project charter, implementing governance model that includes community. So now we are going to look at three different levels of scale and each example demonstrates some or many level of qualities. At first, early stage. So if you remember UNICEF venture funds invest in very early stage companies and we provide structured mentoring to provide high impact payoffs. I discussed about open source mentoring where we work very early with what right licenses to choose, how to draft our project charter in a way that it reflects our mission, vision, community statements, slowly building knowledge base within the company about how to be a model DPG or open source project and move away from there. And actually I might just go back to this one and add on Vipple's point here too is I think one of being of my former UNICEF hat. This was something that basically when these companies have questions and they're trying to figure this stuff out, having that mentor or someone who can help kind of be a seer, someone who's been down the open source road before and can help answer some of these common questions and sticking points when you're just getting started. This is one of the really key values of that mentoring is you get someone to talk to when you're trying to figure all this stuff out on the beginning, someone who either can help answer your questions directly or help connect you to somewhere else in the ecosystem. So again, that early stage piece can be really helpful trying to think through these challenges from the start instead of like, I can think of a few projects where maybe it would have helped them if they had thought about some of these challenges from day one. So basically around data and privacy mentors who can come and help you audit what kind of data you are collecting which can later fire back. So all of this mentorship really impacts the future alignments. So I did mention I changed hats recently so now I'm at Red Hat and while I've been in the Fedora Linux community which is the upstream for one of Red Hat's core products, I'm still, I've been in the Fedora community for eight years but I'm new to Red Hat. So I'm kind of still learning my way around and one of these things I think is really cool as I've joined the open source program office is we have this team called Vertical Community Architecture. And so this team at Red Hat helps establish and continuously refine upstream and community strategy for vertical markets particularly trying to understand this upstream business model. So if I look at my Fedora piece like we're always talking about upstream first and not just trying to keep all of our patches downstream, we're always trying to go and help all these dependencies that were part of our building blocks for our products. So this team is helping other people who might not be, you know Fedora Linux is going on 20 years old now, we've been doing it for a while but our movement is growing, more people are coming into the fold and so this team at Red Hat in the open source program office is trying to help bridge that gap to help people understand these things. So investing early has long term payoffs but the value add is not always packaged so well and so that's where I feel like this team tries to help with that packaging for the partners and people that we work with. I should give you an idea from our, how we talk about this team inside Red Hat. So this team supports vertically focused projects and initiatives inside and outside the company, creates potential new project engagements, places that we want to be involved that might help our upstreams or our own products, helps map and cultivate a range of upstream options to these vertical growth initiative goals and gaps. We track upstream engagements on an ongoing basis making sure we're sticking true to that upstream first ideal and we also help, they also help develop metrics and processes for successful vertical engagements. They also have a part of their charter around this community leadership support. So this is actually providing very close strategic support to Red Hat led projects from inception and they're just getting started as they reach this cruising altitude after they launch. It also helps to plan Red Hat's engagement focus and strategy and opportunities for leadership in these emerging and growing communities and provides community expert consultation for strategic vertical accounts seeking open source strategy engagement. How does this tie in to what I was just talking about with DPGs? This is part of this early stage conversations when you're getting into these topics and you're trying to think, especially with DPGs, we're not really looking at the short term view here. We're really trying to look at the long arc of where we're going with these products and even if they're in that very early stage innovative part of that curve, we want to make sure they're thinking around this long term. So eventually you can progress through that innovation curve instead of having that abrupt drop. So this is I think one really nice example that I found inside Red Hat that I think around how this team is engaging with our upstreams and our dependencies to help these people who are coming into the fold think around some of these challenges and problems. Back here. This is just me. No, this is me. No, I think this is the middle stage. Yes, sorry about the confusion. The lapel mic. Little dance here. So what happens once a company coming from UNICEF perspective? What happens once the investment round is complete and now they're at a stage where they can operate in the right way that we set out to be. We also have further level of funding, but it also ties into a general normal community perspective. It's about finding a framework to identify the right community for you. Where exactly do you go and talk to people? How do you form community? How do you attract contributor? So discussion around that, but also creating evidence of impact. What metrics to observe? What communication and how is the conversation going on around tools? Focusing on that and again coming back to setting governance model, revisiting project charter, all of these things are equally important when thinking of community around the middle to early stage companies. I want to give examples of two companies who were graduated and they later got more funding. First company is a thinking machine. It's a powerful AI to mine data-driven decisions to decide that. Along with UNICEF, East Asia and Pacific Ocean country offices, they are scaled into eight countries, seven is in country by now. And second is Pixframe, which just secured 1.5 million licenses with Gwantamalai government, which is the first of such scale with the government. And Pixframe is a game-based learning tool for children. In this part, I can talk a little more freely because this is where I fall into the Red Hat open source program office. I won't try to bore you with reading all of this. That's kind of like our public-facing part. You might find it interesting, but in a general sense, how this team inside Red Hat's open source program office ties into this middle stage piece. So as a project is growing and scaling and we're upping our engagement with the community, Red Hat's open source program office will actually assign a community architect for a project or an ecosystem of projects depending on what the scope is. But this is where we actually get very hands-on and we are actively engaged in the project, trying to help keep an eye on these issues and key areas of focus around sustainability and trying to make sure that we're both practicing active listening of the challenges in our communities because we're not just working with Red Haters, we're working with people across all ranges of spectrums or different, it could be companies, it could be in Fedora's case, many volunteer contributors or other partners or customers at Red Hat. And that was the first part. The second piece is, so it was around the engagement and right. And so also trying to make sure that we're acting, living our values basically when we're working with these communities that we're actually putting our money where our mouth is and working with our communities and supporting them as they continue to grow and scale. So this is the part where I think as I'm working in Fedora, which is an older community, but I also have many colleagues who are working with these newer projects who are kind of slowly approaching that cruising altitude that I mentioned. This is a way that we help provide a more sustainable focus for these projects to make sure that they're getting their voices heard, that active listening piece. And then we're actually taking steps and actions to make sure that we're supporting them and helping them grow in a sustainable way. So this is a small slide. Our point is middle stage or early stage, investing in community really supercharges you and it matters a lot as early as you can start. And I think also to build on this, part of this whole theme of this talk around full stack DPGs and kind of what we're getting at with the gap in the DPG standard that we talked about is this whole community piece isn't really defined, not just for DPGs, I would say probably across the board in the open source space. But when it comes down to it, you really have to take the steps early on. And if you do that, when you get to this mature level stage, it makes it so much easier to avoid these challenges that will prop up. If you, you know, you'll still have challenges, you can't solve everything in advance, but at least you can try to avoid some of these bigger challenges, existential ones that might be governance or in some cases, license change. Oh, sorry. So the idea was when sudden change in community around this slide, we were talking about what does the change in community looks like at a larger scale company who have been doing for a while and then suddenly they want to invest more in community or there already exists a community but in change in certain directions. And we were discussing about community with flash on how it can fire back because suddenly some people, your partners, industries you are working with, they may not be aligned with you. So at a larger stage, it can be challenging while you may have more resources to invest into, you may have more people to work around building a community and looking at how can we do the right way. But it can also hurt a lot of people who are already using your tools and suddenly they were not expecting it. But thankfully it's for all the way the good way, but communication can matter a lot. Certain examples, even though changes have done for right, if not communicated properly it can be taken the wrong way and it can hurt a lot. For example, this is a personal example I felt, centristream. If you know how the communication around centristream, it was a long time coming, it's actually done for good in certain cases, but when communication not done right at a larger scale, it can create a lot of chaos in the community. And kind of a part of this is when you get into this mature stage, you're not quite that young early stage project you once were where you can make decisions fast and quick and there's fewer people to consult and be your stakeholder. When you reach that mature stage that again kind of building community in from the start, it comes down to building consensus and acting with consent. You might not always have that 100% consensus, but at this point when you're reaching this mature stage and as a DPG, something that's really important to make sure you're reaching your right stakeholders, is making sure you're getting that consensus. You're engaging with your key partners or people who have a clear stake in the project. And ultimately it comes down to this piece of making sure you're acting with the consent of your community. So to wrap it up almost, and for some time for Q&A, our point is just the code does not matter. There are multiple technologies, multiple angles to it and it's not just your IP is not just about code anymore, it's all the things around it, all those different indicators that we talked about, but almost more, something that's missing on how do we identify the clear path forward in future. There are multiple angles to it and we are ready to discuss that with you. The value of DPG lies in what it's created around the code, not just in the code itself or not just the model itself. So let's invest in full-stack DPG, which is also a call. How can we decide what full-stack DPG means and how can we ensure the sustainability of it? That's us and we are ready to discuss or take question and answers. We have a mic. No, we can repeat the question. Part of global harm, who decides, how it starts, there must be some political agenda somewhere that decides who is going to decide what's harm and what, and then from that starting, because I can give examples of really bad things in my opinion, like the Pegasus software despite people, some people say that that software can present more harm. The question is who decides what is no harm. To this, that's where we discussed how digital public good alliance makes digital public good standards and in those standards is how we define what is do not harm. Collection of PII's, right? That's the harm that we don't want to have when it's a digital public good and there is a software that's collecting your information that's not adding to the best relevant practices. If it is collecting for the most important needs, is it following certain right security and deployment practices? I'll add maybe three prongs of this that I'll say. The first one I think in your question was kind of like who says, who gets to define this? Part of that goes back to the slide from the digital public good alliance is all those key stakeholders that are there. In a sense, those are probably the biggest stakeholders who have a, that doesn't mean they're always talking about the standard and every member organization is voting on what is do no harm or not, but this is kind of the body of like where some of the voices are. But I also say at the same time, all of these things are open and have open processes on GitHub where you can open an issue and discuss with the, I guess it would be like the program management and the co-secretariat where people, anyone in the public can come and flag these issues and open a discussion around like, hey, like what about this part? All right, so we're at time. I'll just add one more piece on that question. I think around like the open source bend is that, you know, around this protection from harassment piece, I think is a nice example in the open source context because in that UNICEF open source mentoring, we help people with code of conduct and helping them think through like how do you handle like this case of harassment when you have either it could be users who are interacting on the platform or contributors who are engaging in the community. Not a perfect answer, but I also would encourage you to check out the DPG standard on github, github.com, slash DPG Alliance, slash standard. Maybe we should put that link on the slide next time. But I think we are all out of time.
