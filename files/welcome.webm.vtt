Good morning everyone, welcome to the Destination and Automation Dev Room, I'm going to be

00:09.760 --> 00:12.960
very quick and then we kind of to Remy.

00:12.960 --> 00:18.960
So we have one small ask from you, you can find this poll, the chair next to the door

00:18.960 --> 00:21.080
and here also on the desk.

00:21.080 --> 00:25.520
We want a little bit of feedback because we're trying to get a bigger room with more people

00:25.520 --> 00:29.440
and it's still early, but we expect more people to come in later than today.

00:29.440 --> 00:34.440
So if you're kind enough, just to feel the same, I got anonymous on paper for only and

00:34.440 --> 00:35.440
that would be awesome.

00:35.440 --> 01:01.440
And that's it, you know, let's start.
