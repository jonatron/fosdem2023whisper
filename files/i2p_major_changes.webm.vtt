Hi, everyone. This is I2P, major changes of the peer-to-peer network by Conrad Bechler.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Close enough. Enjoy.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Hello, everyone. Thank you for being here. That's my third I2P talk at FOSSTEM.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
First one was about DNS. That was the most difficult for me personally.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
And now a major changes of the peer-to-peer network of a bunch of programmers,

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
which are creating I2P, which is an overlay network.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
I'm an independent researchers and software architect and developer,

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
and I'm developing libraries, and I'm working full-time for Diva.Exchange,

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
which is a small non-profit association in Switzerland.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
And there is nothing like a centralized model involved,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
because I'm totally living in the peer-to-peer I2P world,

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
because I really love what the I2P developers and the open sources space are doing.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
Since the last 20 years, and I suggest we're looking now at the agenda.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
I'll give you a short introduction of I2P, and then we're looking at what the developers did.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
As the latest changes of the code.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
And we'll focus, since I'm an application developer based on the I2P network,

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
what is the impact? We're looking at the summary.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
And I understood that there are no questions, so if you have questions,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I'll be outside in the hall for a few minutes,

01:41.000 --> 01:49.000
and I'm happy to get in touch with you if you have critical and skeptical questions.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Short thing, what is the role of Diva.Exchange within I2P?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I2P is a developer team.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Diva.Exchange is a developer team.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
And the I2P developers are spread all over the world.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
The Diva.Developers are spread all over the world.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
We're cooperating friendly, but we're not the same.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Diva.Exchange is primarily a library developer and is supporting

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
official, so-called official, open-source Docker images.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
That's what we're doing.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Myself, since I'm a researcher, I'm cooperating with Swiss universities,

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
and I'm open for all corporations with any university to take a very skeptical perspective

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
towards our own work.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Now what is the I2P network?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I2P network is an overlay network.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
And now please jump to the very last line of this slide.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
I2P gives you privacy by design, serious privacy by design.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
It means you get confidentiality and total anonymity.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
Just as an example, this statement that the network gives you total anonymity

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
is something which we do research in Switzerland, whether we can break this anonymity.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And that's one of our research approaches.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
But currently, at the current state of knowledge, and since I2P is existing

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
since 20 years, we can say it's confidential and anonymous.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Now a question.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
Whoever in this room, in the past presentations, there was around 5% of the audience

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
have ever gotten in touch and used I2P in their life.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Please, hands up. Wow, that's close to 20%.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Cool, thank you.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
So for the others which do not know it, anonymity has a cost attached.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
And this cost is called latency.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
So when I'm talking about an anonymous network which gives you full confidentiality,

03:54.000 --> 04:02.000
then these messages are multiple time encrypted and hop from peer to peer to its destination.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
And through another tunnel, they hop back, the reply hops back.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.000
And this is giving anonymity on a very, very, very high level.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
A word to be clear here.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
I2P has no storage capability by itself.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
It's a transport layer.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Now how to get I2P?

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Those which got in touch with it, they know that.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
There are the Linux repos, and then there are PPAs,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
and then there are the container maintained by Devo Exchange, which you find on Docker.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Now why is there I2P?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
And why is there I2PD?

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
Because there are two versions available from two development teams.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
In short, I2P is written in Java.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
It has a user interface.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
And there are a lot of fans around there which really like that.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
And then there is a smaller version, which is I2PD, which is written in C++,

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
and which is the demon only, so it's rather a bit more for admins.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
Devo uses I2PD, and there's also the image maintainer on Docker for this version.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
From my point of view, both are equally valid.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Word of warning, please don't trust any binaries which floating around here and there,

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
which you can't reproduce locally by yourself, please build it yourself if you can, and sure you can.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Because this gives power to the open-source developers.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
So if you just consume some binaries, please don't.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
It's also dangerous because you have a router running on your local machine.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
The whole thing here is it's a peer-to-peer network without any central authority,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
without any trust involved.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Now, the latest changes.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
Since 20 years I2P is existing and gets developed,

06:03.000 --> 06:11.000
and there are two transport protocols.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
TCP and UDP.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
TCP as also used within other overlay networks was a long while,

06:20.000 --> 06:28.000
so around four years already upgraded to so-called NTCP2, which is much modernized,

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
so the TCP communication was already pretty well done in the last four years.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
But UDP, which is something where you just blow out messages to the network,

06:39.000 --> 06:46.000
and I'll talk about that in a minute, which is fast for I2P in an I2P context,

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
was not modernized since 15 years.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
And the developer of I2P, they worked one full year on modernizing UDP,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
and they call it SSU2.

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
So when you hear SSU2 in the context of I2P, it's UDP.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
If you want to dig deeper, then please take a look at noiseprotocol.org,

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
that's very important also for other overlay networks you might have heard of,

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
and the developer team of I2P has borrowed quite some things from WireGuard,

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
VPN, and also from Qwik, and there are some RFCs around,

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
so please dig deeper by using these hints.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Then the cryptography had to be updated too.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
There will be more work coming in the upcoming years, I know for sure.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
But it's now already on a quite good state.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
All right, seven minutes to go.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
What were the goals?

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
UDP, the performance, is simply much better in an overlay network

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
than TCP.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
Me as an application developer, which is creating a fully distributed storage layer

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
on top of the I2P network,

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
performance to communicate between the nodes in the I2P network is an issue.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
So for me, it was always the choice to take UDP,

08:27.000 --> 08:35.000
and I implemented a gossiping protocol to realize this fully anonymous blockchain,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
and so this distributed storage layer,

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
and I needed UDP that the peers could communicate within each other.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
So for me, this was really an important goal that they could improve the performance a lot.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
Nationally, as you know, there are countries in this world where communication is not that easy

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
as we have the luck to be here in Europe,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
so obfuscation is a topic.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
For all those people, for all the whistleblowers and the journalists

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
which are using I2P in critical countries,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
they must not be detected,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
and I2P is one of the premier solutions too

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
for such people which need communication on a very confidential level.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
So the obfuscation was a big topic,

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
and additionally, again, UDP is easily attackable,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
so the developers had to look into the security problems they had,

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
and they did, and they did a good job.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Right.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
There are a few other challenges of UDP, like the fragmentation of messages.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
You know, you have a long message, you want to send it through the network,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
but it gets chopped up into pieces, and UDP is not reliable,

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
so the developers really had some challenges to solve in the last 12 months.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
But the fact is, they have implemented strong solutions,

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
and today, if you look at the release notes of I2P,

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
I2P is in a much better state.

10:20.000 --> 10:29.000
And this is what I want you as a core take out of this presentation.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
I2P gives you, since 20 years, real privacy by design,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
and the developers did a good job the last 20 years.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
But now, with this performance improvement,

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
and that's my personal view on their work,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
they really made a major step forward.

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
Because UDP is for application developers really important within the I2P network.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
That's my personal view on it.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Please feel free to criticize me afterwards in the Q&A session outside

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
if you see this differently, or if you have a different view on it.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I'm happy to hear that.

11:08.000 --> 11:16.000
But these reductions, they are relevant.

11:16.000 --> 11:23.000
For us as application developers, we directly felt this performance impact.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
In November, when the release was, so four months ago,

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
or three and a half months ago,

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
the performance in our blockchain test network improved very much.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
And although I believe from research point of view,

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
we have quite some work ahead of us to,

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
skeptically and very critically looking at the latest changes

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
to see whether some weird box have been introduced.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
The first impression of the two months is,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
that's a new generation of I2P.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
So for me, the performance impact is really, really relevant.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
We're on the target.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
We're seeing the target line.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
Takeouts.

12:15.000 --> 12:23.000
After 20 years of development, I2P is the leading peer-to-peer privacy by design network

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
which is a transport layer only,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
which gives you today very modern cryptography,

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
very modern possibilities to use as an application developer.

12:36.000 --> 12:48.000
The performance increased significantly since last November.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
And if you feel as a researcher too,

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
or as an application developer to take a closer look at I2P,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
now it's a good time.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
Either you can invest as a researcher trying to break the anonymity

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
and present it at an upcoming conference,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
or you try to create some applications on top of it.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
I believe currently is a good point to take a look again at I2P

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
because now it's really quite fast to use and it's also fun to use.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
On GitHub, so that's in the lower right corner and you'll find it online on GitHub,

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
you'll find Docker images which help you to get started with I2P really quickly.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
You can, because a peer-to-peer network,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
to create it as a test network is quite complex.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
But we created here simple images for you which you can start with Docker Compose.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
You have all the containers running,

13:46.000 --> 13:57.000
your member of the I2P network and you can write your application on top of this network.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Here is a list of sources.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Please do your own research too

14:03.000 --> 14:12.000
because privacy by design also means that we hope to motivate US developers

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
to take a look, a very close look at the documentation,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
a very close look at the source code to be skeptical

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
because privacy is such an important topic for us as developers.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
So we're always very, very pleased if we get critical feedbacks

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
on the development of the stuff we're doing.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Thank you very much for your time.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Have a great 4STEM. Thank you.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Thanks, Koran. Really nice talk.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
Again, if you have questions, please grab them outside and be happy to answer.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I hope.

14:58.000 --> 15:10.000
Thank you.
