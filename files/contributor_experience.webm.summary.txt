Inessa Posen, a member of the Contribute Experience Lead Team, spoke about the work her team is doing to improve the first-time contributor experience of open-source software development in the sci-fi ecosystem. She discussed governance and policymaking, which are important for creating safe spaces for contributors and progression from a contributor to a team project leader. Supporting newcomers is also necessary, and her team has been creating better technical documentation, creating safe spaces for questions, and using Gitpod and GitHub code spaces for newcomer sprints. The team is also supporting active contributors by diversifying contribution pathways, hosting community events, and working on web accessibility. They are tracking metrics and conducting qualitative research and have also started the Contributor Experience Project, a community of practice for those interested in improving the contributor experience in open-source development.
