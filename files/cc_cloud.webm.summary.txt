The speaker, a software engineer from Microsoft's KINFORG team, discusses the integration of confidential computing technology with existing ways to deploy containers on cloud platforms, particularly focusing on Kubernetes. They mention that the adoption of confidential computing can be boosted through integration with cloud native containers, but there are challenges that need to be addressed, such as image management, metadata control, and deprivileging the control plane API. The speaker suggests some potential solutions, such as streaming encrypted image layers, reviewing changes made by the control plane, and implementing an encrypted transport between privileged users and the container management stack. The speaker concludes by expressing optimism about the engagement of the community and the potential for the adoption of confidential containers in the future.
