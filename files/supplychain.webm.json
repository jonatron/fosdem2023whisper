{"text": " So, thank you all for coming. This is securing your software supply chain one open source project at a time. My name is Lori LaRusso, that's a picture of me and my kiddo. I am the open source program manager at JFrog, I don't know if you guys have heard of us, I'm sure you have. And I'm also the marketing outreach committee chair of the Continuous Delivery Foundation. Feel free to find me on Twitter or on LinkedIn. Hi everyone, thanks for being here. My name is Fahad Dermanj and I work at the Linux Foundation as an executive director of the Continuous Delivery Foundation. And that's my photo with my son because she puts her daughter, so I had to put my son. So, thanks again for being here. Okay, so I know you guys are hardcore Java developers and so I'm surprised that you're in this room and I appreciate you for staying for our talk. So why is supply chain security important? So let's just do the math real quick. So 99% of all software is developed with open source components. And of that, at least 85% of enterprise products are created using open source components. So any sort of work we do to secure the supply chain is going to have a tremendous impact not only on your own projects but on the enterprise in general. So I have a quick question for you. Oh, no I don't, just kidding. So what happens when you change slides first thing? So supply chain security, right? Like the shift left has happened, you guys are all like working on securing your code before you go to production, everything is good to go, right? Maybe or maybe not. So now I've got my question. So how many of you know what percentage of increase in software supply chain security attacks happened in the last year? Anyone, throw out a number. How much? 650 was in 2021, 2022 number. So we're already at 650. Anybody? Anybody? Okay. 742%. There was a 742% increase in software supply chain attacks in 2022. That's kind of a big deal, right? That's kind of something that we should all sort of look at and say, hmm, what can I do to help decrease this number and make sure that my projects are running smooth, my work is running smooth, I'm efficient. So when we do the numbers, there's a 99% of software has open source components. 85% of enterprise software is built using open source components. And there was a 742% increase in software supply chain attacks in the last year. Okay. I think now we're all listening and thinking, yeah, this is probably something we should look at. So in the last 10 years, we've had six massive attacks. I'm sure you're all familiar with SolarWinds, maybe the British Airways, the amount of money that these corporations lost, the amount of productivity, the amount of time, the effort that the developers had to put in to fix things that were broken from the beginning because maybe somebody didn't maintain a project because, you know, maintainers, nobody gets paid, right? Like things happen, you move on. And so in the last 10 years, we had six massive attacks. And I'm sure if I say log for J, everyone's going to shrug. So that wasn't an attack, but that was a discovery that could have been significantly crazy. So what are the three types of supply chain security attacks out there? I think we can all read. So there's known vulnerabilities, unknown vulnerabilities like zero day attacks. So that's where that log for J came in. And then non-code issues. So human error, people attacking, hackers are getting smarter, they're looking at things in a different way and they're going in and trying to cause disruptions. So this is a very American reference because we all have cars. So how many of you turned on your ignition and your car didn't start? So you had to replace your spark plug or your alternator. But if you got in your car and it started, maybe you wouldn't know that your tail light was out because it's your tail light and you're just like, I can go. So that's the genius of a supply chain attack. They attack the parts that are built in between, the things that you don't notice. They're not denting your car, they're not breaking a window, they're not breaking your alternator, they're going in from the inside and busting things out. So as this might be a little outdated reference, but Winner is here and it's time to really take this seriously and Fatih is going to talk about some open source projects that are helping to secure the supply chain. Thanks Lurie. So things look a bit, how to say, risky or kind of demoralizing because all these attacks happening like new vulnerabilities are disclosed and some of those vulnerabilities that are currently exploited and we are probably impacted by them one way or the other. And if we think about like 2020, 2021, people start talking about these things like software supply chain security and so on and then governments started making some noise and I'm sure most of you heard this famous White House executive order, 2021, May, June or something. And then other countries, other governments followed the suit, India released something similar and EU had this cyber security act and everything. And those things like the governments, the regulators, they are putting out of focus around this topic. But as you know, the regulations, it takes a while for them to become real, like it goes through all these real processes, politicians are involved and things are a bit slow. Because of that, the communities we are involved in or the projects we are developing or the contributions we are making, we all have a big chance to impact and improve the situation even before those things, those regulations, laws become real. And as Laurie mentioned, like some of the communities, they are actively working on improving the state of software supply chain. And I took just four of those communities on this slide and they are kind of different from each other and they are taking to this slide on purpose. Like CD Foundation is where we are contributing to and as a foundation and as our projects, we mainly evolve around continuous integration and continuous ecosystem and projects. And some of our projects are very famous Jenkins. They have a table here, Jenkins is under CD Foundation, Spinnaker and other CD orchestrator tool that is under CD Foundation. And we try to contribute to efforts from our perspective because when you look at the how to say, scope of supply chain, it is vast and no foundation, no one project can fix those issues. And we as the practitioners from continuous integration and continuous ecosystem do our bit to contribute those efforts from continuous delivery perspective. Because the attacks Laurie summarized, the people are actually abusing pipelines themselves as they are hijacking pipelines that are kind of route to production. And that's why within our community we are contributing those efforts. OpenSF is another foundation under Linux Foundation that works on security best practices, standards and so on. And they are very much focused on supply chain security itself. So CDF looks at from CDF perspective, OpenSF looks at the supply chain as a whole. And OWASP is another project that's not under Linux Foundation and it works on improving the security of OpenSource and CNCF, which I'm sure most of you heard, Kubernetes and other cloud native projects, even though security is not their primary concern, they are doing lots of work around security by publishing white papers or releasing best practices for cloud native. They actually had another event, I think it was this week called cloud native security con. So these foundations, committees, they are all different, but they are all trying to contribute. As a Java developer, as Java, you know, people contributing to Java ecosystem, I think we can also try to contribute these efforts and make sure that the stuff we are developing, the people who are using what we are developing, what we are making available for them to use is as secure as possible so they don't, you know, face problems. One of the things, again, we took examples from these different communities to show what they are doing. This is not an extensivist, this is just a snapshot of what they are doing, there are lots of other initiatives going on. But if you look at OAS, for example, they recently released this report, top 10 CICD security risks and, you know, I'm sure there are people among us who are doing CICD for their communities, their projects, their organizations and some of these items, we do those mistakes without knowing and there are some people out there who are exploiting those issues and hijacking pipelines and injecting malicious code and instead of real artifact, maybe some bad artifact is, you know, flowing through our pipelines and going to production, impacting end users. So this is one side, the CICD. And this is another project called supply chain levels for software artifacts, Salsa. This is under open SSF, open source security foundation. And this also looks at things a bit like end to end perspective, instead of just focusing on, you know, you have your source code, secure development practices or you have your artifact, you must sign your artifact, but Salsa looks at the entire supply chain and it is a framework for giving projects, organizations, committees to have different levels of security. It has four levels, you start with very basic build automation, documenting your build process and it goes to fourth level, which is the most secure and, I would say, increases confidence to your supply chain. And the practices documented by Salsa is pretty good and it's already actually, many communities actually start adopting their community pipelines or community production systems to adhere to these levels that come with Salsa. Another project, again, this is under open source security foundation, CICD store. This is about signing the artifacts. I think, like some of you know, May 1 requires PGP signatures and CICD store is similar to PGP, but it's keyless signing and it is a collection of open source projects like FUTU or RECORE and so on to make it easier for developers, maintainers, package managers to build and distribute artifacts in a secure manner. So when you publish your artifact, it's signed so people can check if that is the right artifact they are expecting, they can verify that signature and make sure that they are not getting some weird random artifact and using it as dependency perhaps. So this project is actually pretty interesting because when we think about open source, we want many people to use our projects, we want many other tools to adopt our library or whatever. And CICD store is actually showing great adoption and many other open source projects are adopting CICD store for signing their release artifacts, for example. And this again, another snapshot I took from CICD store landscape and you see all of these are open source projects, they are located under different communities and they are different from each other and they started signing their artifacts. And this is the CICD store, May 1 Gradle. I've seen a blog post yesterday actually, it was talking about like the status of CICD store with May 1 and Gradle and I believe May 1, Apache May 1 project started working with CICD store to adopt CICD store for signing the artifacts and they had a two-step plan, they are currently working on the first step and the expectation is that they will adopt CICD store coming months, I don't know when, but the work is happening there. And the Gradle is a build tool which you probably know, they also start looking at CICD store for signing artifacts. And if you go back to the title of our presentation like securing open source supply chain one project at a time, like CICD is a big area and sometimes I'm a CICD person, I'm a developer and I don't, like I can't secure my software as best like some other people because they may know CICD better than me, but one thing I can do if I am developing a library, if I am releasing artifacts, I can at least sign that artifact so when people pull that artifact during their build process, as a dependency, then they can check that artifact to make sure they are getting the right one without some tampering and so on. So another project I want to highlight is Tecton Chains and Tecton is a project like Jenkins but Kubernetes native continues their framework and it has multiple projects underneath Tecton Chains, Tecton Dashboard, Tecton Pipelines and so on. The reason why I want to highlight Chains is as a CICD practitioner, like as I noted there are lots of risks we have within our pipelines. People might hijack them and we must make sure the pipelines, the phases in our pipelines, the tasks within our phases, they are only doing what they are supposed to. They are not doing anything else but what we tell them to do. When Tecton Chains comes up with some kind of observability, it takes the observability and applies to the pipelines. So whenever Tecton runs a task, it takes a snapshot of that task, records whatever happened during that task, signs it and stores it so you can go back and audit your tasks if you face issues, security issues, you can check which task actually caused that problem and then make sure that task is fixed. So it is like observability of pipelines will be an important thing going forward. And the last project I want to mention is the youngest project or latest project that joined the CIDI Foundation, Persia. Again we distribute packages and we hope that they are safe, secure and people use them with confidence but sometimes it is difficult and it takes some effort to make sure to verify those packages are built by the right people, community organization and they are not tampered with. Persia comes with Bitcoin, not Bitcoin, no. Blockchain? Blockchain, yeah. I mixed those two. Blockchain-based technology and it is like peer-to-peer package distribution network. So multiple nodes could build the same artifact and they have this algorithm, they check if this artifact is same across all over the place, all those nodes distributed and then the package could be consumed by the users safely and securely. So these were like five, six different initiatives and there are tens or even maybe hundreds of other types of projects and initiatives. So I think we as developers, we have responsibility for our users, obviously as Dory mentioned, some of us are not getting paid for this and we are doing that for our fund and someone is using our project, at the same time we are responsible. We make something available for people to consume and if they are facing issues because of some of these simple things we are not putting in place then we may perhaps feel responsible and do our bit to make sure we improve any and each project we are involved in. So I just want to close with all of the foundations that we mentioned today. So each one has projects, each one has SIGs, each one have working groups, they are all alive and well in terms of communication whether they have it on Slack or on Discord or mailing lists, things like that and if you look at these foundations and you look at the corporate sponsors for these foundations you might be surprised that your corporation actually sponsors one of these and with that there are tons of benefits that you might not be receiving that you are eligible for. So there is always trainings, there is webinars, there is opportunities for like white papers, blog posts like Bhatti was saying there is best practices in each of these depending on what area you are interested in. So I would encourage you to go to each of these and there is tons of other foundations out there but here are just some core that are really working on supply chain security from multiple angles and I think it is something that as job and developers you know you should look and see what other people are doing and how you can also just improve and move forward as well. We all know Java is not going anywhere so it is time to kind of see what else that you can do to help yourself on the front end so on the back end you are not paying millions of millions of dollars lost hours, wages, all that good stuff.
