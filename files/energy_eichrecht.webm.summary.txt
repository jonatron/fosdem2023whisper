The speaker discussed the German Calibration Law, or Eichrecht, and its transition towards a common European Calibration Law in immobility. They pointed out various issues with the current system, such as the lack of security and privacy in EV driver authorization methods and the need for secure mechanisms for law-balancing services. They also discussed the use of digital signatures to ensure the accuracy of measurements and the creation of a common language and architecture for immobility protocols. The speaker also introduced their open-source transparency software and the need for a system project to provide trustworthy charging station location, real-time, and security related data. Overall, the talk emphasized the need for a rock-solid, secure, privacy-aware, and extensible architecture in immobility, based on open-source first development and collaboration without any walled gardens.
