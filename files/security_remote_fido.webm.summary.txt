Alexander Bokovoy gave a talk at FOSDEM about enabling FIDO2 support for remotely managed users in free and open source software development. He explained that FIDO2 or web often is becoming increasingly important for governmental organizations and other enterprises, and how Red Hat is responding to customer demands by enabling the use of passwordless credentials such as FIDO2 in their systems. He also provided a demo and explained the details of how this authentication process works with centralized identity management, LDAP records, and the integration of free IPASSS and Kerberos. The talk ended with a Q&A session around topics such as adding another factor to the authentication process and support for user nameless login.
