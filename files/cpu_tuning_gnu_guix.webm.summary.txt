Ludovic Cortes gave a lightning talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 about the software deployment tool, Geeks, and its ability to provide tools for reproducible research and HPC. He discussed the issue of targeting CPU microarchitectures for performance and introduced the concept of package multi-versioning, which applies the idea of function multi-versioning at the level of entire packages, making it possible to optimize C++ template libraries. This allows for portable performance without compromising reproducibility. Geeks allows for the tuning of specific packages and annotations to optimize them.
