{"text": " This is my first conference and I am not very good in English, so forgive me if I say something wrong. I will speak about the footnotes in multi-column sections. I worked on this in last year, a year ago. I thought it can be an interesting problem. Oh, I had to go back. Okay, so I got a back ticket to a fix and it was a very simple ticket at first sight. It was only just a one line text and somehow the writer displayed it as two pages and while the word was displayed just one page. Beside the one line text there was a footnote and its sections has two columns and there was a continuous section break. First I talked, it's just a problem about the section break, some why it's changed to a page break or something like that, but that was an instinct. It was a strange thing why the footnote and the column was needed. If I deleted any of them then the writer changed to one page and it was okay, but I wasn't, it was changed why it is needed. So I started to debug to find where it's become to a page and I found the problem in the layout in calculation and there was even a comment about it stating that the footnote container causes to maximize size in this case. This function to maximize function will calculate if we have to maximize the column frame, the whole section frame, to the whole page and it has several conditions like is footnote at end and is endnote at end. They are checkboxes on the GUI named the collected end of text and the collected end of section for end nodes. They are, they was false in this case. Oh the hasfollow isn't matter now, it was false in this case too, but there was another function that contains footnote container. I checked this function and this function just blindly check if the section have column frame tried that has of footnote container frame tried and if it has one then it returned the first one it found. So now it seems the function was directly righted like this way. So the question is was why do we want to break a page in this case? I even checked the git who changed it or something like that but it was in the very first commit I could reach in the initial import at 2000 year and nobody changed it and I was even wonder why this many condition is needed not just the first one I found but the not collected end is still needed for it. For this I had to analyze the frames how they work so I listed the frames related to footnote some case. The footnote frame is for one footnote entity it can contain a text frame and this can be in a footnote container frame and that frame contains a list of footnotes. It's important it's not two-dimensional list it's just a simpler list that it can display and this footnote container frame can be in a page frame or a column frame. So what is important in it that the footnote container frame does not really support columns it just I could say just one column of footnotes and that's all but we can put this container frame in any of the column frame event so if we put this container frames in every column frame then it will seems like if we support it's like support multi columns. So in one case we want footnote like multi columns as like it's in the world in the other case we want if we don't check the collected end text we want the footnote to be at the page and in the other case we want the footnote to be in the columns end in physically but as we say in the display and it can be true only if the column end is equal to the page end so that's why they maximize the size of the column to the page size. In our case it's not a good idea because in my test case there was only one footnote and it doesn't need to be multi columns but if we wouldn't do this what I showed in the previous slide there could be a contradiction like I made a test document there is two sections I checked the collected end of text which means I want the footnote to be after the section end there is two columns at the first section and three columns at the second section it's very good in this way but if we would change the collected end of text we would uncheck this I mean we want all of this footnote at the end of the page then how many columns you want to how many columns you want it's a contradiction we can't say that two or three because any of them could be wrong. So what we should need we should be able to have column childrens for the container frame because it's not should be but it must be it just should be like words able to have indifferent number of columns at page as many as in the text so we should have a ability for the users to choose how many columns you want in the footnote but we should keep the ability to that's all okay sorry and it's almost end.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 28.52, "text": " This is my first conference and I am not very good in English, so forgive me if I say", "tokens": [639, 307, 452, 700, 7586, 293, 286, 669, 406, 588, 665, 294, 3669, 11, 370, 10718, 385, 498, 286, 584], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.33456166585286456, "compression_ratio": 1.0625, "no_speech_prob": 0.3856492340564728}, {"id": 1, "seek": 2852, "start": 28.52, "end": 36.879999999999995, "text": " something wrong.
