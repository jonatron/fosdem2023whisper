WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.680
Okay, so we are going to start the next course.

00:09.680 --> 00:14.800
The next course is about optimizing your co-applications for integration, learnings from integrating

00:14.800 --> 00:18.240
of the project with NextCloud.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.240
Thank you.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.240
Hello, everyone.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.480
My name is Wieland Lindenthal.

00:21.480 --> 00:27.040
I'm one of the lucky co-founders of OpenProject, and today I'm here because I'm also the managing

00:27.040 --> 00:33.000
engineer of the OpenProject NextCloud integration.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.480
Just to get the first things of the most important messages out right now, I assume that here

00:37.480 --> 00:42.160
are more core developers of open source software, collaboration software, and also product measures

00:42.160 --> 00:43.640
here in the room.

00:43.640 --> 00:49.960
For you, please take home this message, prioritize integrations on your roadmap.

00:49.960 --> 00:56.040
Right now is a great moment where the public sector, not only the public sector, but many

00:56.040 --> 01:04.520
people ask for integrations that we integrate our open source software together to provide

01:04.520 --> 01:11.560
an alternative to the Office 365, to the Google Cloud, to Google applications, and so on.

01:11.560 --> 01:18.520
Right now, people ask us that we join together forces, so together that we are stronger and

01:18.520 --> 01:23.600
become stronger in each single application so that we provide an alternative to the

01:23.600 --> 01:24.600
big tags.

01:24.600 --> 01:28.520
Okay, so integrations are really important.

01:28.520 --> 01:33.520
And with that, every single application, if we integrate, every single application doesn't

01:33.520 --> 01:39.320
need to do what the other application does, so we can focus on our own stuff and get better

01:39.320 --> 01:47.400
in our own silo, on our own puzzle piece of the big picture.

01:47.400 --> 01:53.400
Another bad news, building integrations is unnecessarily hard.

01:53.400 --> 01:59.040
The good news is, you always encounter the same problems again and again.

01:59.040 --> 02:04.720
So that's kind of predictable what is going to fail when you do an integration.

02:04.720 --> 02:10.240
So my call out here is, please drink your own champagne and participate as core developers

02:10.240 --> 02:15.720
in the integration projects that integrate into your system, because then you see the

02:15.720 --> 02:19.880
issues that people face when integrating.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.800
Because integrations are amazing, right?

02:21.800 --> 02:26.120
Just imagine what the web would be without a link or a browser would be without extension

02:26.120 --> 02:28.240
or a mobile phone without application.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.160
It would be boring, right?

02:30.160 --> 02:36.200
And it's just unpredictable what integrations come out if you just let people do.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.960
And people have great ideas.

02:37.960 --> 02:44.640
So the one example of such a great idea was the public sector, the city of Cologne and

02:44.640 --> 02:51.440
the University of Duisburg-Essen approached us with the idea of, hey, you had open project,

02:51.440 --> 02:57.160
we like you really, really much for organizing work, organizing tasks, organizing our teams.

02:57.160 --> 03:03.400
And we also use NextCloud for organizing our files to share the files with our people.

03:03.400 --> 03:08.520
And we always can find the same problem again and again, where are the files for our tasks?

03:08.520 --> 03:10.640
So when you do some work, you do a real job.

03:10.640 --> 03:15.160
You usually need some files as input to work on the task.

03:15.160 --> 03:20.120
And then at the end, you need to deliver some files and put them somewhere, and you need

03:20.120 --> 03:22.920
to communicate someone where the files are.

03:22.920 --> 03:29.280
So why not tracking that at the same entity, which is the ticket, we call it a work package,

03:29.280 --> 03:34.320
and solve that problem and have some real integrity between the two systems, like work

03:34.320 --> 03:40.160
package and real ID linking to the files in NextCloud.

03:40.160 --> 03:44.240
So for the last year, roughly eight people were working on this deep integration, a lot

03:44.240 --> 03:46.640
of people, because it's pretty hard.

03:46.640 --> 03:54.440
But anyway, so what we got is what you can see here is like an open project with a work

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
package.

03:55.440 --> 04:00.080
And you can see there's some tasks, like second fermentation dough, you want to do this, you

04:00.080 --> 04:02.040
want to have a nice pizza.

04:02.040 --> 04:07.680
And on the right hand side, you have the files tab, where you see all the files that are

04:07.680 --> 04:08.680
related.

04:08.680 --> 04:12.280
And now it's not only that you have attachments, which were there already not open project

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
before.

04:13.280 --> 04:20.040
You can also add multiple NextCloud instances to your open project and say, OK, these files

04:20.040 --> 04:24.880
should be stored here, with that contributor, these files should be stored there with this

04:24.880 --> 04:28.880
client, with this subcontractor.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.760
So you can have multiple NextCloud instances connected to OpenProject.

04:33.760 --> 04:42.280
And you will always see which files are relevant for finishing a task and where you should

04:42.280 --> 04:44.080
put the files when you're ready and done.

04:44.080 --> 04:48.600
And you hand over the task to the next one, the next design, let's say, and you follow

04:48.600 --> 04:53.600
a workflow process with an open project.

04:53.600 --> 04:58.960
And on the other side, or NextCloud, when you're on a file or you're on a folder, you

04:58.960 --> 05:04.480
can see where these files or folders are relevant and which tasks, which business processes

05:04.480 --> 05:05.480
they come up.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.320
So you can see here on the right hand side, we have this OpenProject tab.

05:09.320 --> 05:16.440
They can see, OK, this file is relevant in two places and two work packages.

05:16.440 --> 05:22.120
You can quickly see what status they are in so that the problem of where the files for

05:22.120 --> 05:27.360
my task are finally solved.

05:27.360 --> 05:32.560
Now I want to get a little bit deeper into the architecture of that thing because we

05:32.560 --> 05:37.200
want to talk about problems that come with integrations.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.320
So it's a very, very high-level architecture picture.

05:40.320 --> 05:44.520
As you can see, there's an OpenProject server, there's an NextCloud server, there's an OpenProject

05:44.520 --> 05:48.720
front-end that runs in the browser and the same browser that runs the NextCloud front-end,

05:48.720 --> 05:50.960
same different browser windows.

05:50.960 --> 05:56.280
And for this integration, we extended the OpenProject core so it's not a plugin, it's

05:56.280 --> 06:00.200
right in the OpenProject core, which extends the OpenProject front-end.

06:00.200 --> 06:06.800
And on the NextCloud side, we put everything into a NextCloud app, which is basically a

06:06.800 --> 06:14.160
bundle of code that you execute within NextCloud, or you could call it a plugin or extension.

06:14.160 --> 06:20.120
So that plugin extends the NextCloud server and also the NextCloud front-end.

06:20.120 --> 06:25.560
What we chose for the communication between the two systems is that we want that every

06:25.560 --> 06:29.840
user, because users have permissions on the one system and users have permissions on the

06:29.840 --> 06:34.800
other system, we wanted to make sure that these things match up, OK, so that an OpenProject

06:34.800 --> 06:41.520
user that is looking for a file can only see files, can only select files to link them

06:41.520 --> 06:45.320
that he or she has access to.

06:45.320 --> 06:49.920
But on the same time, we wanted to make sure that all linked files are visible to all users

06:49.920 --> 06:53.640
because someone says, like, this is the relevant file, maybe you don't have access, but you

06:53.640 --> 06:55.080
should know that these files exist.

06:55.080 --> 07:02.040
So we have these references by file ID from OpenProject to NextCloud.

07:02.040 --> 07:06.000
And the other way around, of course, as well, when you're in NextCloud and you saw these

07:06.000 --> 07:11.360
files linked, the work packages linked, you also should only link those work packages

07:11.360 --> 07:12.800
that you have access to.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.480
So work packages are organized in projects, you're a member of a project or not, so depending

07:17.480 --> 07:18.960
on this, you have access or not.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.640
So we need to have some one-on-one matching between the users.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.800
So we use OAuth for this one-on-one matching.

07:25.800 --> 07:30.400
So users are always authenticated and don't need to re-authenticate every time they log

07:30.400 --> 07:31.400
in.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.200
OK.

07:34.200 --> 07:40.200
But there's one thing on this architecture you can already spot, maybe, that it smells

07:40.200 --> 07:42.080
like trouble.

07:42.080 --> 07:47.440
That is the arrow in the middle that goes from the OpenProject front directly to NextCloud

07:47.440 --> 07:52.800
because that is a request, a cross-site request, in the browser between two domains.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.280
And here's where trouble starts.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.960
We'll come to this later.

07:57.960 --> 08:02.560
So clipping.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.800
So yeah, from this work, I just want to come up with a couple of things that lessons learned

08:06.800 --> 08:11.600
and I would just point them out for you to think and digest a little bit what it means

08:11.600 --> 08:14.240
to your project.

08:14.240 --> 08:19.920
So of course, OK, if you want to have integrations, of course, provide an API, that's obvious.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.280
NextCloud and OpenProject does that pretty well, I think.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.400
We have docs and examples.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.600
But then the tiny things start, like, OK, you have an API.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.440
You think it's cool and safe.

08:30.440 --> 08:38.400
But in the example of this direct access that I set on the architecture image, this is about

08:38.400 --> 08:41.320
direct file upload and downloads.

08:41.320 --> 08:45.640
So this is something that is kind of obvious, that you don't want to send the data through

08:45.640 --> 08:50.720
the OpenProject server, like, let's say if you want to go buy a movie, and then to NextCloud,

08:50.720 --> 08:57.720
you want to upload this directly or download this directly to the OpenProject front-end.

08:57.720 --> 09:08.320
So it turns out the API that NextCloud provides for this thing is working-ish, but not, you

09:08.320 --> 09:13.520
know, in a way that it did not work, OK?

09:13.520 --> 09:19.320
It didn't work, but it was really unfortunate because they had everything in place, but

09:19.320 --> 09:25.840
I bet they never had the scenario in their own company to use that in a cross-site domain

09:25.840 --> 09:26.840
environment.

09:26.840 --> 09:35.360
And so they didn't come across, like, twice a course problems, you know, your course security

09:35.360 --> 09:41.520
on the browser that prevents you to do stuff that you shouldn't do in the browsers, like,

09:41.520 --> 09:43.920
browser security features.

09:43.920 --> 09:48.600
And if you just have non-browser clients, these things don't show up.

09:48.600 --> 09:52.200
If you just have a NextCloud client on your desktop, these things don't show up.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.040
They are not browser context.

09:54.040 --> 09:59.880
So my lessons learned is here, also for us OpenProject, we are not saving these fields

09:59.880 --> 10:02.040
neither.

10:02.040 --> 10:06.280
Make sure that if you provide an API, also test it in a browser setting, right, and not

10:06.280 --> 10:08.200
just write it and hope it works.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.080
You have these course preflights.

10:10.080 --> 10:16.400
You need to check if the course preflight itself doesn't fail, right, there can be issues.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.680
OK.

10:17.680 --> 10:22.840
Another one, a tiny one, but I need to say this, you know, we as OpenProject, we want

10:22.840 --> 10:23.840
to link files.

10:23.840 --> 10:28.480
And these files we don't reference by path because the path is different for every user

10:28.480 --> 10:30.320
or can be different for every user.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.120
Because if you get a file shared with you and you save it in your NextCloud with a different

10:34.120 --> 10:38.080
file name, the path is completely different and it doesn't work for the other user.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.840
They say, another user, there's an OpenProject project.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.360
So we need to reference the file.

10:44.360 --> 10:52.080
But there's no API for getting files, thanks, for getting files by ID, especially not if

10:52.080 --> 10:58.120
you want to know what is the original file name that the owner of the file gave to the

10:58.120 --> 11:04.560
file or if you want to know if the file was already deleted, if it was trashed, it was

11:04.560 --> 11:07.120
in the trash bin.

11:07.120 --> 11:11.520
Information like this, we want to ask them frequently in order to update our knowledge

11:11.520 --> 11:13.800
about the file on OpenProject.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.800
It wasn't there.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.920
Probably never needed on the NextCloud side.

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
So that's cool.

11:17.920 --> 11:18.920
They don't need it.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.160
But, yeah, kind of obvious.

11:20.160 --> 11:26.480
There's main objects of NextCloud and we need them, we need the information.

11:26.480 --> 11:31.440
And, yeah, this problem became visible here.

11:31.440 --> 11:38.760
If you want to build, allow, if you want to allow integrations into your system while

11:38.760 --> 11:41.640
creating a plug-in interface is a great idea.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.760
OpenProject has a plug-in interface.

11:43.760 --> 11:47.000
You can extend OpenProject code as you like.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.600
You need to be with server admin in order to make it run.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.680
NextCloud is much ahead in that sense.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.680
They have the app store.

11:53.680 --> 11:58.960
You just can click from a catalog and as a, not as a server administrator, but as an

11:58.960 --> 12:03.440
application administrator who doesn't like to talk to server administrators.

12:03.440 --> 12:09.600
You can simply download, download, install extensions to NextCloud.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.040
It's in the core of NextCloud and that's really, really cool.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.040
It's amazing.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.040
And I'm jealous I would love to have this OpenProject.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.040
Yeah.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.040
What about the source, you know, you have four of them.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.040
It's all PHP, you know.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.040
Actually, no.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.040
The app store, I think, is Ruby.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.040
Is it?

12:25.040 --> 12:26.040
Yeah.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.040
Okay.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.040
Tomorrow it's done.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.040
No.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.040
It could also be Python.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.040
I just know something.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.040
Okay.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.040
Okay.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.040
Thank you.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.040
I don't know how much you care about whether it's either of these.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.040
Okay.

12:38.040 --> 12:45.920
So you have this plug-in interface built in your application and that the typical things

12:45.920 --> 12:53.600
that every person that is implementing this interface comes across.

12:53.600 --> 12:59.880
For example, if you want to have cross-site fetching, cross-site calls, you need to allow

12:59.880 --> 13:08.200
in that application, extend the content security policy for cross-site requests.

13:08.200 --> 13:12.760
There's something, for example, that we discovered that OpenProject did not allow or make easy

13:12.760 --> 13:14.320
in the first place.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.600
So we had to extend that.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.080
It's a typical one.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.560
It only, you know, in the theory everything is working and then you run it in your browser

13:20.560 --> 13:26.600
and in the very last moment of implementing all the features, you see it's not working

13:26.600 --> 13:30.040
because of content security policy.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
Okay.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
This is a nice one.

13:32.040 --> 13:36.480
So when you're like an application administrator in OpenProject and you're also an application

13:36.480 --> 13:40.840
administrator in NextCloud and you want to set up the connection, the integration, the

13:40.840 --> 13:45.120
first thing that you do is you put in the URL of the other system, right?

13:45.120 --> 13:50.800
And you want to know if you put, or you should get some feedback if the, actually, if the

13:50.800 --> 13:51.800
URL is valid.

13:51.800 --> 13:56.280
Let's say you're next, you want to know that OpenProject is actually responding.

13:56.280 --> 14:00.360
OpenProject is responding in the necessary version.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.880
We don't have that.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.320
We don't expose that information.

14:04.320 --> 14:09.200
You want to know if the setup is complete.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.400
There's more about the other way.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.920
Like, let's say from OpenProject you want to connect to NextCloud.

14:14.920 --> 14:19.320
Of course, we also want to know if our extension is installed.

14:19.320 --> 14:25.320
So it would be great if you have an API endpoint that gives you information and saying, nah,

14:25.320 --> 14:28.840
it's not installed, so the validation of the URL is failing.

14:28.840 --> 14:33.800
There's something that is very, very useful for the administrators to get a relevant

14:33.800 --> 14:36.640
feedback for why things is not working.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.760
Because if you just put in a URL, you don't have any idea why it's not working.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.000
You need to get feedback.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.360
And this is something I think every core developer should think of as providing as a super nice

14:46.360 --> 14:50.160
candy for developers.

14:50.160 --> 14:54.640
Another one that is, that's a topic.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.520
So we're working a lot with OAuth.

14:56.520 --> 15:02.920
And setting up OAuth, I don't know if you know what, it has basically a lot of features

15:02.920 --> 15:07.720
like a secret, an ID, it has the redirect URL, and so on and so on.

15:07.720 --> 15:12.880
And if you are a host or a tester, you would like to script that stuff.

15:12.880 --> 15:17.160
So you would like to have an API to set this stuff up.

15:17.160 --> 15:21.440
And it's great if you provide an API for setting up OAuth.

15:21.440 --> 15:26.800
Also, if you have an API, you can do stuff like having one button and some setting and

15:26.800 --> 15:30.480
say, disconnect the integration all over the place.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.480
Delete it.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.480
I want to start again.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.480
I screwed up.

15:33.480 --> 15:36.480
I don't know what is going on.

15:36.480 --> 15:41.720
I screwed up.

15:41.720 --> 15:47.920
So for this, you need an API so that you can do this.

15:47.920 --> 15:53.360
And if you had actually deleted an OAuth connection, then please also make sure that the tokens

15:53.360 --> 15:54.860
are deleted.

15:54.860 --> 16:00.680
So that was something that we discovered with NextCloud, that the tokens were still around

16:00.680 --> 16:02.720
for quite some time.

16:02.720 --> 16:11.480
And the good thing is it came up and we could provide tickets and this thing could get solved.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.840
That's also another one, nice one.

16:14.840 --> 16:21.080
Just imagine you do the OAuth connection, so there's one user in NextCloud and connects

16:21.080 --> 16:26.720
as the user in an open project and that user happens to be admin in an open project.

16:26.720 --> 16:31.240
Suddenly the access as an admin comes to NextCloud.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.240
So there's a lot of powers.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.240
You can create projects.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.240
You can delete users.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.640
And maybe for the integration, that is not needed and vice versa.

16:38.640 --> 16:43.760
The open project might not need complete administrator rights on NextCloud.

16:43.760 --> 16:54.280
So it's like opening the surface for attacks or the opening for problems to vulnerabilities

16:54.280 --> 16:55.280
by a lot.

16:55.280 --> 17:02.560
And I think open project and NextCloud, we could do better in having scoped OAuth access

17:02.560 --> 17:09.120
control so that you don't allow creating or deleting projects or that you don't allow

17:09.120 --> 17:11.240
deleting users and so on.

17:11.240 --> 17:16.760
So limiting just for the user scope actions.

17:16.760 --> 17:20.720
We can do better, we'll come.

17:20.720 --> 17:25.400
Also what is nice, what I really enjoyed about working with NextCloud is that they provide

17:25.400 --> 17:26.400
a design system.

17:26.400 --> 17:32.600
They have frontend components that allowed us to have more consistent UI that look and

17:32.600 --> 17:38.480
feel like the NextCloud and also increase the development speed for us.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.600
At OpenProject, we also are working on a design system and UI components.

17:41.600 --> 17:46.720
So if you want to have a talk, listen to a talk about this, Parimal, where are you tomorrow?

17:46.720 --> 17:47.720
Same time?

17:47.720 --> 17:48.720
Yeah.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.720
Okay.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.720
Have fun.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.720
Yeah.

17:51.720 --> 18:02.680
Then also what is really handy for developers that develop integrations for your system

18:02.680 --> 18:11.520
is if you have containerized development environments already at hand, so it's easier

18:11.520 --> 18:16.960
to check out your code with the latest supported versions.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.360
For example, NextCloud has some multiple versions you need to support, you need to check, you

18:20.360 --> 18:22.280
want to find out if it's still working.

18:22.280 --> 18:26.480
And of course, the current main branch to see what is actually changing in the main

18:26.480 --> 18:31.920
branch is my code still live or it's already dying.

18:31.920 --> 18:36.480
So it's really nice to have, for example, Docker compose files that help you setting

18:36.480 --> 18:43.760
up and lower the barrier to get started in developing an integration for your application.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.760
Yeah.

18:45.760 --> 18:53.320
Also as a bonus on this, if you can provide examples how to set up your CI quickly so

18:53.320 --> 18:58.520
that you don't need to fiddle around with that, if you just have good standard practices,

18:58.520 --> 19:05.200
how to have CI running with that core image and with the plug-in, it would be also very,

19:05.200 --> 19:08.280
very handy for developers to have.

19:08.280 --> 19:17.920
I think we could sneak into other integrations and we could see how they did it in NextCloud.

19:17.920 --> 19:24.640
So it wasn't such a big trouble, but if you have a good example, that is really, really

19:24.640 --> 19:25.640
helpful.

19:25.640 --> 19:33.920
So with all these small spots of lessons learned that we have had in the last year, I just

19:33.920 --> 19:41.160
want to send you home, let it sink in, and just remember, integrated, we're stronger.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.160
Thank you.

19:42.160 --> 19:56.400
Thank you, we have six minutes for questions.

19:56.400 --> 20:22.160
So the question is why we need to deal with multiple NextCloud versions.

20:22.160 --> 20:30.800
I think NextCloud has multiple versions in production, like supported, so it's like I

20:30.800 --> 20:39.960
think 23, 24, 25, maybe 22 still, I'm not sure, and they have different code, but we

20:39.960 --> 20:47.040
just provide one, currently, we just provide one piece of code that is the NextCloud app,

20:47.040 --> 20:50.800
our NextCloud app, and we don't want to provide three different ones.

20:50.800 --> 20:56.760
So we want to make sure that in that app, all versions are supported.

20:56.760 --> 20:57.760
It's different for OpenProject.

20:57.760 --> 21:01.880
OpenProject always has just one running, one up-to-date version, so you'd always need

21:01.880 --> 21:07.600
to update to the latest version unless you want to get into trouble.

21:07.600 --> 21:13.840
So this is why you need multiple versions.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.840
More questions?

21:14.840 --> 21:15.840
Okay.

21:15.840 --> 21:16.840
Thank you.

21:16.840 --> 21:17.840
Ah, Ben.

21:17.840 --> 21:29.280
I want to add on to this that I think declarative configuration is always better than scripting,

21:29.280 --> 21:36.760
so if you can, if it's possible, the application, for example, provides OAuth configuration statically

21:36.760 --> 21:41.360
instead of via the script, I think that's always better because it allows you to basically

21:41.360 --> 21:48.360
do status-deploy all your applications, including the whole OAuth context.

21:48.360 --> 21:56.800
Yeah, so the comment was just, if you can provide it as a, let's say, a YAML file or

21:56.800 --> 22:00.960
something like this, a declaration, it's better than to have an API.

22:00.960 --> 22:06.280
I'm not so sure about OAuth in that moment because then you would need to have a center

22:06.280 --> 22:09.720
when you set up both systems at the same time, you wouldn't need to have a center that decides

22:09.720 --> 22:17.000
on the OAuth client ID and client secret and make it configurable from a center.

22:17.000 --> 22:25.760
Yeah, if these IDs and secrets there get actually generated by the applications itself because

22:25.760 --> 22:29.240
they get updated and maybe your center is not getting updated, maybe you create just

22:29.240 --> 22:31.000
a vulnerability here, right?

22:31.000 --> 22:36.280
So we were discussing this forth and back, but we believe that, you know, next time an

22:36.280 --> 22:41.720
OAuth project that continuously update and maybe some central distribution software might

22:41.720 --> 22:46.000
not get touched in three years and then it's outdated in the algorithm, so it's not secure

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
anymore or whatever.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:57.000
So, Trey, yeah, I'm not sure maybe you talked about it or I probably was not listening.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
I think you mentioned files as an example for the actual what is integrated between

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
both systems.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.920
Was the scope broader than that or was it primarily set and was that any discussion

23:06.920 --> 23:11.520
because there were multiple things that could be integrated in the sense, right?

23:11.520 --> 23:17.440
Yeah, I mean, this integration basically focuses on files and folders, right?

23:17.440 --> 23:23.000
Because you want to, it's about integrating digital assets into work packages, right?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.960
So you have these links.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.960
So that's the example I chose.

23:27.960 --> 23:33.400
It would be interesting to have some standards also for API standards.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.400
Why not?

23:34.400 --> 23:36.960
Let's say every system has users.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.240
Why does a user need to be represented different in every system?

23:40.240 --> 23:44.520
Why can't we have a standard on that or the avatar or, you know, it's like there's stuff

23:44.520 --> 23:45.520
of permissions.

23:45.520 --> 23:50.240
Why can't we have permission standard somehow for all open source vendors?

23:50.240 --> 23:51.240
I don't know.

23:51.240 --> 23:56.880
Let's think about it, but I didn't see a reason why it needs to be so different.

23:56.880 --> 24:00.160
Users have been around for so long.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.160
Yeah.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.160
More questions?

24:02.160 --> 24:03.160
How do you mind?

24:03.160 --> 24:04.160
No one asked the technical question.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.160
There was a lovely portion of pizza.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.160
Did you make that yourself?

24:06.160 --> 24:07.160
Yes, that's my pizza.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.160
Oh, lovely pizza.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.160
Pizza Napolitana.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.160
Milan style.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.160
Okay.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.160
Thank you very much.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.160
Thank you.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.160
Thank you.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.160
Thank you.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.160
Thank you.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.160
Thank you.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.160
Thank you.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.160
Thank you.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.160
Thank you.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.160
Thank you.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.160
Thank you.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.160
Thank you.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.160
Thank you.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.160
Thank you.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
Thank you.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.160
Thank you.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.160
Thanks.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.160
Thank you.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.160
Thank you.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.160
Thank you.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.160
Bye.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.160
Bye bye.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.160
Bye bye.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.160
Bye bye.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.160
Bye bye.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.160
Bye by with two.

24:37.160 --> 24:38.160
Bye bye.
