In this talk, Tobias Augspurge discusses the potential of open source software to enhance sustainability in technology. He shares his project called Prototypes, which aims to increase the sustainability of environment-focused open source projects. Tobias highlights the importance of understanding and managing natural resources to achieve environmental sustainability. He discusses various applications of open source software in environmental intelligence, such as analyzing satellite data for air quality and measuring biodiversity. Tobias presents the results of his study, including the number of projects and contributors in the open source ecosystem. He points out the lack of popularity in environmental sustainability compared to other software domains. Tobias suggests that openness itself is an indicator of sustainability and emphasizes the need for open source software in areas like sustainable investment and carbon offset assessment. He proposes the integration of earth observation data into sustainability assessment processes to improve transparency and traceability. Tobias concludes by suggesting the development of an operating system for environmental sustainability and the importance of collaboration and community building in this field.
