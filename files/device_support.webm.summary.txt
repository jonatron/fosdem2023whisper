The talk focused on the importance of upstream support for device longevity, with an emphasis on continuous integration testing through KernelCI. The speaker discussed their work on upstreaming the kernel support for certain Chromebooks, and how tests enabled through KernelCI could have detected issues earlier in the upstreaming process. They also discussed ways in which KernelCI could be expanded, such as with more subsystem-specific tests and more labs, to further improve device support and catch regressions.
