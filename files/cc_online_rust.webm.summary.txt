The talk introduces the TDSHIM firmware, a Rust-based shim firmware for Confidential Containers, and compares it to the TDVF virtual firmware for confidential VMs or rich service TD environments. The TDSHIM provides trust boot and secure boot features and runs on TDX or other hardware-based confidential computing solutions. The talk also covers TDSHIM's internal workings, including its TDXM specification and tools, and explains how it meets the special requirements of hardware solutions like TDX. Finally, the speaker presents the TDSHIM project's testing and quality assurance measures.
