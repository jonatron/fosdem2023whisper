The speaker, Wookie, talks about the year 2038 problem, which is the rollover of the 32-bit signed integer Unix time in January 2038. They explain that while most people use 64-bit computers that are not affected by this problem, there are still many 32-bit systems, such as cars, TVs, and embedded controllers, that will need to be addressed. The speaker discusses the work that has been done so far to fix the issue, including kernel fixes and changes to libraries like Perl and G-LIP-C. They also mention the challenge of transitioning from the old 32-bit time to the new 64-bit time in a binary distribution like Debian. The speaker presents some numbers on the number of packages affected and highlights potential issues that may arise with certain software and file formats. They invite feedback and discussion from the audience to help find the best approach to solving the year 2038 problem.
