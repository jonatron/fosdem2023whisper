00:00.000 --> 00:13.120
Hello, I'm Konstantinos Papadimitriou, I'm the web developer and analyst from GeForce

00:13.120 --> 00:15.920
Open Technologies Alliance.

00:15.920 --> 00:26.240
I will show you how we combine easy appointments with GC for online appointment management.

00:26.240 --> 00:43.360
In Covid, a lot of private and public services switched to online appointments, most of them used closed source or services for the online part.

00:43.360 --> 01:02.080
At GeForce, we adapted the easy appointments, which is an online software platform for appointment management and CC, an online open source meeting with audio and video,

01:02.080 --> 01:13.600
and combined them into a seamless integration for booking an appointment that will take place online rather than physically.

01:13.600 --> 01:24.560
About our organization, we established in 2008, we are a non-profit organization and also we have

01:24.560 --> 01:33.200
officers, holders, universities, research centers and public beneficial organizations.

01:33.200 --> 01:45.920
Our objectives are development and promotion of open standards, open software, open content, open data, open government, open educational resources,

01:45.920 --> 01:55.360
active common license of open material and design technologies, and also open hardware and design.

01:55.360 --> 02:02.240
We contribute to openness in education, in public sector and also in private sector.

02:02.240 --> 02:12.880
And we have thematic working groups on open software and open standards, open technologies and education, open governance and open data,

02:12.880 --> 02:25.680
open design, open hardware, wireless networks, information, system security and personal data protection, and also innovation and entrepreneurship.

02:25.680 --> 02:33.840
Well, the easy appointments part, it's a web application for appointment management.

02:33.840 --> 02:41.920
It has a very easy installation on a web server and also configuration is simple.

02:41.920 --> 02:49.600
Users can use it directly without having to install any applications.

02:49.600 --> 03:03.280
The operation is using a web browser and it works on a computer, on tablet or mobile phones since the design is responsive.

03:03.280 --> 03:10.560
It's a really simple and fast operation, optimized without unnecessary options.

03:10.560 --> 03:16.720
Also, easy to use environment for managing the appointments from the service side.

03:16.720 --> 03:25.280
It supports over 25 languages and also since it's open source anyone can contribute more languages.

03:25.280 --> 03:33.680
It's written by Greek developer Alex Cellegidis, which actively continues the development.

03:33.680 --> 03:45.440
It's open software, open source, and also it has already hundreds of installations around the world.

03:45.440 --> 03:53.600
It's written in PHP, it requires PHP 7.4 or above.

03:53.600 --> 04:03.040
It uses MySQL or MariaDB for the database part, runs on NZINX or Apache web server

04:03.040 --> 04:09.840
and uses PDO extensions for JSON, MbString, OpenSSL and PDO.

04:09.840 --> 04:16.400
It's a developer friendly with clean source code.

04:16.400 --> 04:25.440
And now the JITZY part. JITZY is a set of open source projects that allow easy teleconferencing.

04:25.440 --> 04:32.080
It's written in Java and JavaScript. It's compatible with web by RTC.

04:32.080 --> 04:42.400
JITZY video bridge transmits video and audio to all participants separately rather than combining them first.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.160
And of course it's open software.

04:46.160 --> 04:57.120
The platform now, on the first page, if the text seems Greek to you, actually it is Greek.

04:57.120 --> 05:05.920
In the first menu, the user can select the service he wants.

05:05.920 --> 05:13.120
After that, he selects a specific agent or any available from the service.

05:13.120 --> 05:22.720
And finally, some information appears about the selected service, the duration of the appointment.

05:22.720 --> 05:30.800
On the bottom, you can select also the interface language.

05:30.800 --> 05:37.360
We added the part that you can also arrange an online appointment.

05:37.360 --> 05:47.200
That's why maybe it's the same service, but rather than physically, you want to do it online.

05:47.200 --> 05:56.640
On the second step, you choose the available dates and times of the service you choose.

05:56.640 --> 06:06.240
Or if you select a specific agent, you see his availability or any other agent available.

06:06.240 --> 06:10.400
You will see the calendar here.

06:10.400 --> 06:19.200
In the third step, the user inserts its information, first name, last name and email.

06:19.200 --> 06:24.560
Which in this email, he will receive the details of the appointment.

06:24.560 --> 06:31.360
And also the option to change or to cancel the appointment.

06:31.360 --> 06:45.200
The fourth step, you view the user views all the details gathered for the appointment.

06:45.200 --> 06:56.560
And finally, when he submits the appointment, two emails are, he sees confirmation messages on the browser.

06:56.560 --> 07:10.720
Also, the system generates two emails, one for the user with details and also from the selected agent to the selected service.

07:10.720 --> 07:20.560
The email he receives, again, the confirmation, the details and also in case it's an online appointment,

07:20.560 --> 07:31.760
the location on the location field, it will appear the unique video link to the GC service.

07:31.760 --> 07:45.120
Also, the user will receive an as an attachment and an ICS file, which he can import it to the calendar.

07:45.120 --> 07:58.480
From the administration side, the agent sees all his meetings with information in an easy management environment.

07:58.480 --> 08:14.080
Also, you have roles in the system, so you can have directors of the service, which they will see all the appointments.

08:14.080 --> 08:19.280
Some technical details about our prototype.

08:19.280 --> 08:30.880
We did minimal changes to the appointments source code, so it will be also easy to use it.

08:30.880 --> 08:39.440
If the administrator doesn't set a physical location of a service because it's a service,

08:39.440 --> 08:46.640
so you say the appointment is on this address or this building, this office, if this is empty,

08:46.640 --> 08:56.800
then the changes we did, they generate a unique GC link using the appointments house.

08:56.800 --> 09:05.440
Each appointment has a unique house in the database, so we use this also as a link for the conference.

09:05.440 --> 09:12.400
We used the native location field to store the GC link.

09:12.400 --> 09:19.360
We added the location field in the email the user receives.

09:19.360 --> 09:24.560
And administrators on settings.

09:24.560 --> 09:33.360
We also wanted to show some text with information on the home page, which wasn't an option in easy appointments,

09:33.360 --> 09:38.960
so we also added this, and we wanted to change also the appearance.

09:38.960 --> 09:51.920
So we inserted a CSS file, which from there you can change colors and some design of the pages.

09:51.920 --> 10:03.200
The source code is available on the GitHub you see here.

10:03.200 --> 10:09.200
And that was our project. Thank you for coming.

10:09.200 --> 10:19.200
Does anyone have any questions?

10:19.200 --> 10:23.200
Once further information?

10:23.200 --> 10:25.200
Yes.

10:25.200 --> 10:33.200
I understand that this is a fork from the official easy appointment. Yes.

10:33.200 --> 10:49.200
So how do you manage with the new versions? Do you provide something like an automatic combination to add some touches to the main project?

10:49.200 --> 10:57.200
This is a prototype. We spoke with a developer of easy appointments. He has a system for plugins,

10:57.200 --> 11:03.200
so it could be written as a plugin to easy appointments.

11:03.200 --> 11:15.200
At the moment, no, you change the actual code. That's why also we wanted to make minimal changes.

11:15.200 --> 11:23.200
Thank you, Konstantinos. That was fantastic.

11:23.200 --> 11:47.200
Thank you.
