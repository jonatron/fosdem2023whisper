The talk introduced the Ermine project, which is a young project initiated by InnoCube and joined by five other French companies. Ermine aims to implement an open source policy by breaking down open source license texts into obligations and enriching software bill of materials (S-BOMs) with legal and technical context. The project is still ongoing and not yet in production, but it plans to work with SPDX and CyclingDX in the future. The talk also mentioned that Ermine focuses on legal obligations related to intellectual property (IP) and may include export control, but currently does not handle other legal obligations such as privacy and security. Additionally, it discussed the potential challenges of handling incompatible open source licenses and the intention to collaborate with other projects such as SPDX and Osado. The Q&A section included discussions on license compatibility, assisting users in meeting legal obligations, and partnerships with other projects. Overall, Ermine aims to provide a tool for understanding and managing legal obligations related to open source software development.
