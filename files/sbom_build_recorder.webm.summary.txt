This talk discusses a system called Build Recorder, which aims to capture detailed information about the building process of software. The goal is to record the sources and processes used to create a binary file, providing metadata and extra information about its contents. The presentation explains the functionality of Build Recorder, its implementation using system calls, and the current challenges faced in terms of complexity and performance. The future work includes optimizing performance, handling more programming systems, and porting the system to non-Linux platforms. The talk concludes with a Q&A session.
