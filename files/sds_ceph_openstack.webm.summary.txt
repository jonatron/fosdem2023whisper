In this talk, Francesco discussed the integration of Obestac and Kubernetes, especially focusing on the use of the new CefADM orchestration tool instead of Cefantibol. He also discussed an example of how Rook was employed to deploy a Cef cluster within Kubernetes, and how this combination can provide scalability and resiliency advantages to operators.
