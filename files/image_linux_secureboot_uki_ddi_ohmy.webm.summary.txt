The talk was about image-based Linux and secure measured boot Devon, which aims to improve security by extending the chain of trust at boot. The speaker discussed the various flavors of image-based Linux as well as the shared goals, infrastructure, and specifications, such as UKI (unified kernel image), DDI (discoverable disk image), and CZEXT (a specific type of DDI that can extend a root filesystem). The talk also emphasized the importance of security and the need to protect EATRDs, root file systems, and user space. The speaker also invited people to join and contribute to the UAPI group, which focuses on this area of Linux. There were some questions about comparing UKIs to fit images from UBoot, signing for system UBoot and EXT Linux, and self-enrollment for first boots when compiling the Linux kernel oneself.
