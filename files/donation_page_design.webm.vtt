WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.080
We started, and we went through a number of stages, like a lot of projects do.

00:12.080 --> 00:18.960
We started with a small donation we were trying to build up and get into a system where we

00:18.960 --> 00:28.040
could be self-sustaining because we wanted to actually have the ability to move faster.

00:28.040 --> 00:33.760
We wanted to build a better project for our community.

00:33.760 --> 00:40.520
The way we wanted to do that was we wanted to bring full-time developers into the project.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.480
As of 2022, we've been successful.

00:42.480 --> 00:45.880
We have two full-time developers working on the KeyCAD project.

00:45.880 --> 00:50.920
We have eight other core developers who are all contributing and hundreds of people around

00:50.920 --> 00:57.440
the world who we are able to successfully fund to help work on the project.

00:57.440 --> 01:02.720
Designers, documentation, librarians, all of the people that it takes to make a large

01:02.720 --> 01:11.160
open-source project work is sustained by our donations, by our community.

01:11.160 --> 01:17.760
I want to tell you a little bit about how this came to be because this wasn't obvious

01:17.760 --> 01:23.400
and it wasn't immediate and it wasn't just putting up a single page.

01:23.400 --> 01:28.280
Initially, our first donation page looked like this and you can see I've kind of squished

01:28.280 --> 01:31.160
it down so I could see the whole page.

01:31.160 --> 01:36.000
If you looked at it on your web browser, you would see the top little picture and you had

01:36.000 --> 01:40.080
to go all the way down to get to your donations.

01:40.080 --> 01:51.320
Quick, I would like someone in the room to donate 120 Swiss franc to the KeyCAD project.

01:51.320 --> 01:57.760
The question was for each user who went in there who didn't happen to use Swiss franc

01:57.760 --> 02:03.240
as their base currency, how much is going to show up on my credit card bill if I decide

02:03.240 --> 02:04.840
to support the project?

02:04.840 --> 02:08.800
How do I know that this is going to actually support the project?

02:08.800 --> 02:19.080
All of these initial pain points in our first generation of a donation page were there because

02:19.080 --> 02:23.560
we picked what was available, the projects that were supporting us.

02:23.560 --> 02:29.800
We were initially working through the CERN Open Society Foundation and they provided

02:29.800 --> 02:33.480
this, but they worked in Swiss francs because they're CERN.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.960
Our users, maybe not so much.

02:36.960 --> 02:41.840
We were initially seeing very few donations from this site.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.360
I'm going to tell you how we fixed it.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.400
Six ways or six steps.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.880
The first thing that we need to do is we need to identify who our users are because this

02:52.880 --> 02:58.280
drives every single choice we make in design, who is going to be the person who we're talking

02:58.280 --> 02:59.280
to.

02:59.280 --> 03:07.320
Then never interrupt the experience that your community has, your donors have because the

03:07.320 --> 03:11.800
moment that you interrupt their experience is the moment that they have better things

03:11.800 --> 03:13.040
to do.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.040
You always want to respect their time.

03:16.040 --> 03:23.240
Then shorten that click path, make sure that you're not setting yourself up for failure

03:23.240 --> 03:28.600
by putting intermediate steps that you don't have to have.

03:28.600 --> 03:34.120
Every time that you have to click on another link, you are going to lose more and more

03:34.120 --> 03:39.920
of your community before they get to that final point where they can actually come in

03:39.920 --> 03:43.560
to the larger community.

03:43.560 --> 03:52.200
It's in-house. There are a lot of places that will actually set up donations.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.880
I'm going to tell you, you need to do that yourself.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.040
Then test every single step.

03:59.040 --> 04:08.640
Finally, build your community because this is the basic raison d'Ãªtre that we have as

04:08.640 --> 04:14.280
open source developers is we are a community. We're stronger as a community and this should

04:14.280 --> 04:23.160
be focused as the primary reason for each element in our donation.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.640
First, who is your customer?

04:26.640 --> 04:31.800
Who is the user base that you are trying to support?

04:31.800 --> 04:34.120
For KeyCAD, we were a bunch of engineers.

04:34.120 --> 04:39.520
We were a bunch of designers, circuit designers.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.160
Those were the professionals who were building those circuits.

04:43.160 --> 04:48.120
We're our audience.

04:48.120 --> 04:53.680
We needed to set up the system to reflect that.

04:53.680 --> 05:03.800
Your designers or your customers are also in this space who you're focusing on.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.280
It's not just what you do for a living.

05:06.280 --> 05:10.080
It's where you are in the world.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.560
What language do you speak natively?

05:12.560 --> 05:14.440
What are you most comfortable in?

05:14.440 --> 05:20.640
Once you can make your audience comfortable, your community more comfortable, then that

05:20.640 --> 05:28.160
is a time in which your community becomes stronger, becomes more tightly bound together.

05:28.160 --> 05:35.280
For us, we need to identify where we are. This is actual data.

05:35.280 --> 05:41.840
For KeyCAD, where do we see people coming into the project?

05:41.840 --> 05:47.880
We gather anonymized data that is sorted by country.

05:47.880 --> 05:55.440
The actual map here, our top five regions, the United States, Germany, France, Japan,

05:55.440 --> 06:02.080
and the UK. Notice Switzerland not in the top five.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.960
We were doing this wrong in the beginning.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.840
We were setting up a barrier in the beginning.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.720
We should be donating in euro.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.560
We should be donating in US dollar.

06:12.560 --> 06:21.360
We should be donating in yen and pound, but Swiss franc is maybe not the currency we should

06:21.360 --> 06:22.720
have chosen.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.120
We need to address this.

06:24.120 --> 06:28.200
The first step that we do is we try to address this.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.240
We joined in 2019.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.800
The Linux Foundation started a crowdfunding project.

06:34.800 --> 06:40.840
This was a way of bringing donations into open source projects.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.560
We joined this at the outset.

06:44.560 --> 06:50.000
Our primary reason, even though the Linux Foundation site is slow, even though they

06:50.000 --> 06:55.920
still have multiple clicks and they require way too much data to get you to allow you

06:55.920 --> 07:03.640
to donate, even with all of that, just changing from Swiss franc to US dollar donations met

07:03.640 --> 07:06.240
more of our community's needs.

07:06.240 --> 07:12.280
Our donations increased from about 10 per month to about 30 per month, which is good.

07:12.280 --> 07:18.400
It's a low increase because then we start to bring more people into our community.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.920
We need to do more, so we want to say, all right, what are the pain points still?

07:22.920 --> 07:23.920
Well, we're still slow.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.440
We're still requiring multiple clicks.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.040
I'm going to say, don't interrupt.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.280
Don't interrupt your donor's experience.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.360
I love GitHub sponsors.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.800
It's a wonderful program.

07:34.800 --> 07:40.400
If you're doing that, that's great, but you will never grow your community by putting

07:40.400 --> 07:43.960
the GitHub sponsors up there because the only people who are going to go up to the

07:43.960 --> 07:48.320
top of that page and find that button and click on that button are people who are already

07:48.320 --> 07:56.600
looking for it because no one goes to this page unless they want to download your software,

07:56.600 --> 08:02.400
unless they want to download their software, and the download is down here, and the sponsor

08:02.400 --> 08:07.680
is all the way up there, and so you have to go out of your way to find this.

08:07.680 --> 08:15.520
Going up this, for us, we identify, this is the KeyCAD website.

08:15.520 --> 08:19.400
We identify, why do you go to the KeyCAD website?

08:19.400 --> 08:25.880
You go to the KeyCAD website to get KeyCAD, to download KeyCAD, and so if we're respecting

08:25.880 --> 08:32.680
our community's time, we don't make them go out of their way to the donate button in

08:32.680 --> 08:34.920
the top right-hand corner.

08:34.920 --> 08:41.600
We start with making sure that they get to do what they came here to do first, which

08:41.600 --> 08:43.640
is download the software.

08:43.640 --> 08:51.520
Once you click on the download, instead of just showing a static page, we start the download,

08:51.520 --> 08:57.120
and while they're waiting, we give them the opportunity to donate because this means,

08:57.120 --> 09:04.760
this says, you are already accomplishing what you wanted to do, and we're going to

09:04.760 --> 09:07.840
give you this awesome software.

09:07.840 --> 09:14.760
Your software is awesome too, so that then becomes an opportunity while you're waiting.

09:14.760 --> 09:24.160
Maybe you also want to donate, and so this right here gave us an enormous increase because

09:24.160 --> 09:31.360
people were now willing to say, that's a good idea because I want this software to be better,

09:31.360 --> 09:35.360
I want to support this thing that I use, and our donations increase to 80 per month at

09:35.360 --> 09:37.360
this point.

09:37.360 --> 09:44.360
Now, part and parcel to this is shortening your click path because if you're respecting

09:44.360 --> 09:51.800
your community's time, you don't make them jump through hoops.

09:51.800 --> 09:59.200
Our initial page had nine to 12 clicks over four pages, and it went through postmates,

09:59.200 --> 10:02.560
and it was a mess.

10:02.560 --> 10:09.440
Our current page, every time we shortened it, we saw more people coming in, and so we're

10:09.440 --> 10:12.560
right now at one to two clicks over two pages.

10:12.560 --> 10:20.200
We'd like to get it even smaller, but that's where we're at right now because we have built

10:20.200 --> 10:28.480
this sub-site that we hold on our own.

10:28.480 --> 10:36.400
You can't shorten the click path if you don't own your own project's donation page because

10:36.400 --> 10:46.240
then you're at the mercy of whatever intermediary is going to be in between your community and

10:46.240 --> 10:47.480
you.

10:47.480 --> 10:52.840
We built this ourselves, and we put it behind a CDN, Content Delivery Network, because we

10:52.840 --> 10:54.520
want this fast.

10:54.520 --> 10:59.880
We want this to be directly at the user to the extent that we can.

10:59.880 --> 11:07.600
Right now, when you see this, all you need to do is, if you like the suggested donation,

11:07.600 --> 11:08.600
you click.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.440
It's one click.

11:10.440 --> 11:14.400
If you don't like the suggested donation, you can change it to whatever you want and

11:14.400 --> 11:19.880
then click through, so maybe two if you want to change it.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.480
We go through Stripe.

11:21.480 --> 11:28.400
We go through Stripe for the reason that we can pick how people are allowed to donate,

11:28.400 --> 11:36.360
so within China, for instance, where a large number of our users are, we can link into

11:36.360 --> 11:39.680
Alipay through Stripe.

11:39.680 --> 11:46.400
This allows our Chinese user base to integrate into our community better than they would

11:46.400 --> 11:53.760
be able to if we required credit cards, which are not common in China.

11:53.760 --> 12:01.840
Similarly, JiroPay in Europe, we link that in, SEPA payments.

12:01.840 --> 12:08.400
All of these things are accessible through Stripe, which is one of the reasons why we

12:08.400 --> 12:11.200
chose it, but there are other options as well.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.680
Then, we also added PayPal.

12:15.680 --> 12:20.640
People have different feelings about PayPal, and that's fine, but what I'm going to tell

12:20.640 --> 12:31.920
you is that if your community uses PayPal, then you should use PayPal because that is

12:31.920 --> 12:37.760
meeting them where they're at right now, so bringing your donations in-house.

12:37.760 --> 12:45.120
Internal are where you are controlling the information, and external, you need to get

12:45.120 --> 12:49.000
the information from someone else, and I'm going to tell you that internal is where you

12:49.000 --> 12:53.440
want to be because you get to make your own donation page, you get to make it as fast

12:53.440 --> 12:59.360
as you possibly can, and you get to control the individual steps.

12:59.360 --> 13:08.800
Every time that you make your users make your community wait to donate, every time you increase

13:08.800 --> 13:15.640
that load time by 100 milliseconds, you've lost 20% of people.

13:15.640 --> 13:19.960
They will go back, they'll click the back button, they'll go out and go somewhere else

13:19.960 --> 13:24.320
because you're not sure if it's loading or not.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.760
You get information when you bring it in.

13:26.760 --> 13:35.400
Bring this into your own organization because it allows you to connect with your community,

13:35.400 --> 13:42.000
and you get to every single donation should have a thank you from your project.

13:42.000 --> 13:49.680
You should never leave people out hanging saying, oh, I just sent this money into the

13:49.680 --> 13:52.240
ether, I hope it does something good.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.640
Send them a thank you.

13:53.640 --> 13:57.920
Send them a thank you because it lets them know that the community has received it, that

13:57.920 --> 14:06.760
they appreciate it, and you include in there a link into your forum, into your bug tracker,

14:06.760 --> 14:11.560
into the other ways that the community connects.

14:11.560 --> 14:20.920
This allows you to build these communities that bind all of us together more closely.

14:20.920 --> 14:30.680
Finally, test, real quick, A-B testing, piece of cake, never change everything outright.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.440
Never make a new donation page and get rid of your old one.

14:33.440 --> 14:40.200
You make donate 41, you want to change something, you make donate 42, and the only thing that

14:40.200 --> 14:44.680
you need to change is some simple little JavaScript.

14:44.680 --> 14:50.680
If math.random is less than 0.5, go to this one, otherwise go to that one.

14:50.680 --> 14:56.480
Two different pages, and each of them should have an embedded code in there, an embedded

14:56.480 --> 15:00.480
number that you get to send to Stripe.

15:00.480 --> 15:06.080
Because you're controlling your own donation pipeline now, so you get to send that to Stripe,

15:06.080 --> 15:13.480
you get to send that to PayPal so that when you do this, when you make a change, you get

15:13.480 --> 15:22.200
to look for your metrics, and you get to measure what the changes affect is, and whether you

15:22.200 --> 15:29.080
are trying to get people to join your mailing list because you want to announce releases

15:29.080 --> 15:36.680
or you want to get them to support the project or new users coming in, whatever it is, you

15:36.680 --> 15:43.440
are trying to change, you won't know if you've achieved it unless you're measuring it.

15:43.440 --> 15:51.880
So measure it in a way that respects people's privacy, measure it in a way that allows you

15:51.880 --> 15:56.680
to be the most effective you can in building your community.

15:56.680 --> 16:04.840
And finally, every donation is an opportunity to build your community because your donors

16:04.840 --> 16:12.520
are the most invested customers in your project, and you should treat them that way.

16:12.520 --> 16:20.520
You should bring them in because they saw fit to support you financially.

16:20.520 --> 16:31.080
They deserve to have that community wrap them in ways that are supportive and give them

16:31.080 --> 16:35.880
the opportunity to be part of the larger project.

16:35.880 --> 16:41.040
Every donor gets a thank you email, and then give them ways to deepen that connection,

16:41.040 --> 16:49.880
offer them things that are straightforward, so t-shirts for donation levels or badges

16:49.880 --> 16:56.440
on your user forum, all of these are ways to build that connection between your community

16:56.440 --> 16:58.200
and your project.

16:58.200 --> 17:03.200
And then directed donations give you more information about what your users are interested

17:03.200 --> 17:04.200
in.

17:04.200 --> 17:12.160
Finally, support your upstream because all of us stand on each other's shoulders.

17:12.160 --> 17:18.640
So when you are, whether you are a houseplant open source project just doing this for yourself

17:18.640 --> 17:24.940
or you're a big, large project, if you're receiving donations, pass that up because

17:24.940 --> 17:31.680
the things that allow you to build your project and allow all of us to do better are the things

17:31.680 --> 17:34.800
that we should be supporting ourselves.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.600
So last couple of tips.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.480
Be transparent.

17:40.480 --> 17:48.280
Show people how much processing charges are in the project and allow them to donate a

17:48.280 --> 17:50.320
specific amount to your project.

17:50.320 --> 17:55.880
You can add a small check box to round up to the donation amount.

17:55.880 --> 18:01.000
And always, always, always if you're doing your donation page, watch for fraud because

18:01.000 --> 18:11.160
there are a lot of bad actors who will automatically try to use your donation page to verify stolen

18:11.160 --> 18:12.560
credit card numbers.

18:12.560 --> 18:17.600
So when you do this, you watch out for this because it's not just an ethical responsibility,

18:17.600 --> 18:22.200
it's a financial responsibility to actually make sure that people are not being charged

18:22.200 --> 18:25.160
for things that they don't know.

18:25.160 --> 18:32.760
And so in this case, you can see this was all within one minute, this is actual attack

18:32.760 --> 18:37.960
on the KeyCAD donation website, it's like 30 donations per minute.

18:37.960 --> 18:42.240
They were just cycling through a bunch of credit cards.

18:42.240 --> 18:47.320
And we found the one that they work that they succeeded and we reported it as fraud and they

18:47.320 --> 18:49.280
stop after you do that for a little while.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.400
So thank you very much.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.400
I really appreciate it.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.400
If there are any questions, I'm happy to take them.

18:54.400 --> 19:09.320
Not actually a question, but I think I don't now remember which opens up project it was,

19:09.320 --> 19:14.240
but it might have been KeyCAD actually even, but I remember it was very nice to have like

19:14.240 --> 19:20.120
a donation page, which then listed a bunch of new features kind of that came up recently

19:20.120 --> 19:24.760
and just said that these were made possible thanks to your help.

19:24.760 --> 19:25.760
Yes.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.560
I think that was an excellent way to think about it because it's true.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.560
Yeah.

19:29.560 --> 19:37.440
So the statement was that you can show what the donations have done with and one of the

19:37.440 --> 19:43.880
things that KeyCAD does is after you donate, it shows you a thank you page after the donation

19:43.880 --> 19:48.080
and that it has a little graphic of all the things that we've done in the past year and

19:48.080 --> 19:51.240
we update that about once a year or so.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.240
So yeah.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.240
Yeah.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.240
There we go.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.240
Yes.

19:55.240 --> 20:04.040
How and why did you understand that these implementation were in such a way?

20:04.040 --> 20:09.880
So the question was how and why do we know that we need to make changes?

20:09.880 --> 20:12.960
We weren't where we needed to be.

20:12.960 --> 20:21.560
So we wanted to support full-time developers and we did not have the funding level to be

20:21.560 --> 20:22.720
able to do that.

20:22.720 --> 20:32.360
So we wanted to increase that to be able to develop the project faster and better and

20:32.360 --> 20:37.880
we knew because we'd periodically dog food it ourselves.

20:37.880 --> 20:44.840
We'd try and the developers will donate not just our time but we'll practice going through

20:44.840 --> 20:47.720
the donation page and it was painful.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.880
So we'd click and we'd be like, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.

20:50.880 --> 20:59.000
And then we'd get there and I had to pull up the, like, how much is 120 Swiss franc

20:59.000 --> 21:01.440
in euro?

21:01.440 --> 21:05.400
Now I know but intuitively I didn't know that.

21:05.400 --> 21:13.440
So dog fooding what you build is an important step and it costs you a five dollar donation

21:13.440 --> 21:17.960
which is, you know, you run it through there and you're supporting a good project when

21:17.960 --> 21:18.960
you do this.

21:18.960 --> 21:19.960
Yes.

21:19.960 --> 21:27.920
How do you handle one-time donation versus recurring donation?

21:27.920 --> 21:31.480
So the question is how do you handle one-time donation versus recurring donation?

21:31.480 --> 21:38.320
So we have right here a highlighted one-time and monthly.

21:38.320 --> 21:45.000
So we have this option and you can set up the back end to do that.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.840
Right now we only support that through PayPal because we don't want to be responsible for

21:50.840 --> 21:54.280
keeping track of user accounts.

21:54.280 --> 21:58.760
And PayPal allows you to set up subscriptions without the user account.

21:58.760 --> 22:04.240
So right now we do that through PayPal but the thing to watch out for is to make sure

22:04.240 --> 22:10.920
in your design that you're very, very clear about what the user is, do they have a subscription

22:10.920 --> 22:12.040
or do they have a one-time.

22:12.040 --> 22:16.720
So when you click on this, instead of saying donate, this says donate via PayPal or donate

22:16.720 --> 22:23.400
via credit card, e-wallet, instead of saying donate, we change that to subscribe.

22:23.400 --> 22:30.400
So we do a couple of things to make it really, really obvious that if you move this slider

22:30.400 --> 22:36.400
over here and click on this button, you're signing up for a monthly subscription.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.400
We still have people making the mistake though.

22:38.400 --> 22:43.080
So we're still working out, we're still doing AB testing to see can we get that better.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
Yes.

22:44.080 --> 23:02.760
The suggestion is to have a separate button for the subscribe, yes.

23:02.760 --> 23:06.640
I'm going to AB test that and we'll see what comes out.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.640
Yes.

23:07.640 --> 23:29.200
You absolutely can and I skipped by a couple of the options here for, here we go.

23:29.200 --> 23:37.640
So open collective, Patreon, coffee, Linux foundation, if that's where your community is,

23:37.640 --> 23:38.640
do that.

23:38.640 --> 23:39.640
Absolutely.

23:39.640 --> 23:40.880
That's fantastic.

23:40.880 --> 23:47.400
If your community is on coffee, you should have coffee on there.

23:47.400 --> 23:57.160
But there's a balance to be struck and open collective is nice, but it's one, two, three

23:57.160 --> 24:03.520
clicks deep and we've never seen a way to shorten that and we can't cash it.

24:03.520 --> 24:10.160
So it does add a couple of steps, but I do know a lot of projects that use it successfully

24:10.160 --> 24:11.640
and that like it a lot.

24:11.640 --> 24:18.480
So definitely, you know, test it out, but try to replace one of the buttons, AB testing

24:18.480 --> 24:23.800
with open collective and see if that's where your community is and the only way you know

24:23.800 --> 24:30.200
that is by checking.

24:30.200 --> 24:57.760
Thank you.
