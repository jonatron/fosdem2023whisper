Ann from the Turing Way project spoke about the project's aim to change research culture through open collaboration. The Turing Way is an open source guide on data science and open research that is documentation first. The project started with a focus on reproducibility in science and has since grown to five different guides related to different parts of scientific research. The community is focused on supporting open infrastructure and governance as well as mentoring researchers at every stage and making cross-disciplinary conversations more possible. The project also emphasizes the importance of acknowledging all the different types of work that happen within a community. The community is open and encourages participation from anyone interested, and events such as collaboration cafes and book dashes are hosted both online and in-person. The project has seen growing interest and recognition in policy, education, and public-facing spaces. Future work includes addressing issues of sustainability and scaling the project, as well as translating the work of the project into something that industry professionals can use.
