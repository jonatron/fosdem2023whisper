Gabor Sarnas, speaking on behalf of the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC), gave a presentation at FOSDEM 2023 about graph benchmarks for database systems. LDBC designs benchmarks, conducts research on graph schema, and develops new graph query languages, all of which are available under the Apache V2 license. The benchmarks designed by LDBC simulate a social network and include queries and updates for database systems to compete with. They also have benchmark specifications, data generators, and reference implementations for vendors to go through an auditing process to claim an official benchmark result. LDBC offers free membership for individuals and a yearly fee for companies. Besides social networks, LDBC benchmarks are also used for supply chain optimization, power grids, e-commerce programs, and financial fraud detection.
