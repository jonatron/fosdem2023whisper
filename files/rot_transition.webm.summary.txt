The talk was about a transit planning tool called Transition, developed by a research group called Cher Mobility at Polytechnic Montreal. The tool is aimed at transit professionals and allows them to draw new transit lines for their city, analyze routing options, and simulate and optimize transit networks. It also includes features such as schedule editing and viewer, accessibility mapping, and population and trip-based analysis. The tool is open source and uses data from OpenStreetMap for routing and population simulation. The speaker also mentioned the challenges of bringing research projects into real-world use, such as code openness and partnering with transit agencies. The speaker concluded by discussing the potential of using the tool at a larger scale, like country levels, and considering ways to adapt the city to the transit network.
