{"text": " So the idea behind this talk is to get you looking at your surroundings a little differently. That said, this may be some of the most boring mapping you'll ever do. And it's equal parts sort of diplomacy, translation, but also activism. So who are my OpenStreetMap? Who knows OpenStreetMap? Awesome! Freezing to the converted. All right. Contributors as well? Awesome. Okay. So I won't say too much about this except that the idea for those of you who don't know it is that it's a free, open, editable map of the entire world and a geographical database. That was founded in 2004 by a guy named Steve Coase, who's British. So one of the most powerful uses for this is making maps where people don't have them. And it's incredibly powerful when there's a disaster some place around the world. So who are my humanitarian OpenStreetMappers? Just a few. Okay. Awesome. Any emergency responders, emergency volunteers? Anybody like that? No. Okay. So I started with this because I participated in a map-a-thon for the Nepal earthquake. And it just was incredible to me that I could be sitting at home helping people out in an earthquake all the way around the world. And I'm an emergency volunteer at my hometown of San Francisco, so I started thinking that I could do a lot more with OpenStreetMaps near me, basically. And I started resiliency with the idea to use only open source tools about five years ago. And our big E, emergency classic, are earthquakes. And so this is what San Francisco looked like 30 years ago when the last big one. And it's predicted that we'll have another one, 99.7% chance that we'll have another one like this, in 30 years. However, half a decade that I've been doing this, we haven't had to eat like a good shake. Nothing's happening. No earthquakes, right? And that's what we're prepared for, like those are the maps we're making. But other stuff has been happening. So we've had a lot of other emergencies that we're not prepared for. And this is the Blade Runner sky that we've had in 2018 and 2020. We've had record temperatures, high temperatures, three out of five years. And just the way our houses are built, we're not prepared for this. We don't have sophisticated HVAC systems, like it's really pretty bad. And then this last one is the bomb cyclone flooding. And you really don't want to be out on your paddle board in San Francisco because the sewer water, all of that stuff is all mixed. So we weren't prepared for that. And it just happened at the end of January. So here we are in Fosdam. And I want to talk about Florence, Italy, which is a place that I've lived in and know well. Florence has long had to contend with the Arno running through it, right? It's flooded Florence something like 56 times since the 1100s. And they are prepared for this emergency. So you could basically do a tour of Florence. I don't know if anybody's doing this, but as an emergency person, I totally would. Just seeing the water scars. So that's San Nicol\u00f2. You could go all over the city. There are just how high the water is. So they're pretty prepared for this emergency. It's a wealthy city. There's a lot of smart people. The problem is, in a lot of places in Europe, there's money, and you do things that you don't necessarily need. So I really don't think there should always be an app for that. This is one that the government did. And I couldn't remember what it was called when I was researching this talk. Is it informed citizens or something else? And it's only available in Italian and French, which doesn't reflect the needs of Florence's varying population, right? So what we're looking at here, the blue areas are flooding areas. And the orange parts are landslides. So you're pretty much like the entire Florence is covered. The interesting bits are these extra bad flooding danger zones. But all of this information is trapped in this app, right? So for all of you, since everybody's basically an OpenStream app contributor, the great thing about Europe is that you also have a lot of street image available. So you open up the ID editor. This is that same point, one of these points, on the flooding zone. And this is actually an underpass. So this is in the ID editor with Mapillary. And you could check these points if you don't know what they are from the other map. And this is a flooded underpass. So this would be like a really good thing to have on your OSM map, right? So the other thing that you might find in a city like yours in Europe is that there's a lot of open data, OK? But a lot of this open data doesn't quite make it to OSM. So here we have another classic emergency in Florence, which they also have earthquakes. So in San Francisco, our volunteer emergency thing goes back. Our project goes back 30 years after the last big one. But in Florence, they have the misericordia, which goes back to medieval times. So these people are organized. They have the people. And in this case, this is an emergency shelter. And it goes down to the level of two organizations that are already assigned to this emergency shelter. It tells you the number of showers, how many bed things you can get, whether they've had a ham radio and tested it. Any ham people? Yes, I do it. OK, so we don't have anywhere near this kind of public information. But again, guess what? This is on the open data site and not in OSM. So this is what I mean about your sort of like translation job, because you've got to figure out the tags and you've got to put it into OSM. So there's a very lively OpenStreetMapItalia channel on Telegram. And a lot of the conversation is like, what do we call this thing? What should it be called? And since my first language is English, but I'm American and it was founded by a British guy, a lot of times I'm like, I have no idea, because that's not what we would call it. That said, most of the time you can mediate and find what you're looking for. It's already there. But the cool thing is that if it's not there, you can pitch the community a tag. And we've had to do this for a couple of emergency features in San Francisco, and we got both of them through. So it's not as rigid. If there are architectural features or other things that you want to put on your map that are specific to your country, you can definitely do that. So let's talk about emergency 2.0. So Florence has had a lot of heat waves that they never had before. And again, we're talking about it like a wealthy, famous place. They're not unprepared. They're just maybe not prepared in the way that is the most effective. So they have a very elaborate alert system. And again, we're looking at the open data. These are cooling places that you can go to in Florence. These are typically now in the states. They call them cooling centers. And the idea is it's a public place that has air conditioning that they can't kick you out of. So it's usually a public library. So the hottest month of the year is August. Do we have any Italians in the room? What happens in Italy in August? You don't stay in Italy in August. So everybody goes to the beach. So everybody's at the beach. Nobody's working. So the problem with this is there isn't a single one of these that's open for the whole month of August. We need a plan B. This is a big problem, especially because you don't really know how many people are going to have to play musical chairs, finding a library that they can sit in. So that's another one of the things. So this, unfortunately, for my Italians, these are all the places listed in Florence right now with air conditioning. And even if you know that Italians don't love air conditioning, you know that this can't be right. So for comparison, this is what the bike ways look like in Florence. And if anybody knows Florence, it's not a particularly bike-friendly city. So just the difference between these two things is pretty obvious. Now if you just take a quick look back, again, this is not your exciting mapping folks, but the libraries are not marked on this map, right? So that's a pretty easy thing to do. And the interesting thing about the air conditioning tag is that it's just, yes, the building has air conditioning. It doesn't say it's going to be on. It doesn't say you can go hang out in there. It doesn't say anything. So that's the basic idea behind that. Now Italy has a lot of, my Italian, churches, right? And churches are also cool places that, you know, they tend to be dark and whatever. But let's say they're not ideal for the cooling center thing because how could you tag that in a map, right? But also because maybe you have to have custodians or like, you know, there's something there. But Florence, for example, also has probably a dozen cloisters. And these courtyards are just by definition, they're built to be shady and cool and protected. So here we're looking at the large cloister in Santa Maria Novella. It was opened to the public in 2012 and it is, in fact, big. The other thing is, obviously, once you go map all of these things, the diplomacy comes in because I would never ask someone to go to the mayor or the emergency services and say, we're going to open up all the cloisters and let people hang out of them because, you know, like the other smaller cloisters here have these very famous Paolo cello frescoes and that's never going to fly. You're never going to have a bunch of people hanging out playing cards in the shade in that one. But there are plenty of these. And the other thing is that if you start looking around your town, you're going to be like, everything's mapped. But I will tell you what, this courtyard is mapped down to the single tree, but it's not tagged as a courtyard. So again, I think if you went and got all of these things on the map, then you can start pitching people, right? Then you can start saying, what if we open up these courtyards, you know, the tourists aren't using them, nobody's using them, whatever. The other thing that I would do, definitely, that is also extremely exciting would be to start tagging businesses that you know have air conditioning. So these, as I'm sure you guess, are hotels, right, and some restaurants. What other kind of buildings might have air conditioning that are semi-public? Any guesses? Pardon? Museums. OK. That's an interesting idea. That's what I'm looking for. So the museums in Florence, there are a ton of them, and they do have air conditioning. It's going to be a tough sell, but you could market, you know. But shopping malls, department stores, all of these places. And again, the tag just says it's just air conditioning. It's not, there's no other strings attached about the air conditioning. But definitely, if you had time, you could go around and pitch and say, look, all of these businesses, all of these hotels are air conditioned, and who's using the business center in August? No one, right? So your group could potentially organize to bring a group of people to these places and do that. So again, it's part advocacy, part diplomacy. This is our very, very basic runover toolkit that all of you, since you're all contributors, know. The one thing I would like to point out about this is we've done a lot of work on paper, and the two projects that we use are both EU, because the whole thing is that a lot of this information ends up trapped somewhere that people don't need it. So probably what you need when it's really hot is not a list of all the cooling centers. You need to know where the closest one to you is and what the hours are, right? The other thing about apps, the flooding earthquake, you want to think about connectivity, you want to think about electricity. We've done a lot with paper, and the Americans totally don't get the idea that you need paper. So I think that's part of the reason why both of these projects are Europeans. So it's interesting to start to get thinking about that since you're all already OSM folks. Anyway, what you can do with paper, the kind of things that you could help people get to places with this, because the point isn't really the database, it's getting information to the people when they need it, for the reason they need it. I think that's it. Questions? Yeah? We're just OSM organized that's where we meet and challenge what very hard to get involved in the business. Oh, right. So that's a really good question. OSM, let's see, which is the best place to go? All of my other OSMPs. What country are you based in? Where would you send them? Yeah, mailing list, IRC. Yeah, so the wiki, definitely. Yeah. Yeah, the important thing is to get plugged into the people near you so you could start going like, why is this tagged like this? Why? Anybody else? Yeah. Yeah? Thank you for raising your attention to the topic. Did you reach out to the developers of the Street Complete app to include those topics? Oh, that's really great. So I have not. I have not, but I definitely should. So Street Complete, if you haven't already used it, is a really great way to just tag a lot of stuff, like really banal stuff. Again, like you're super exciting changing the world mapping, but fire hydrants, benches. It has a lot of emergency things. It doesn't have these features, but you're right. We should definitely do that. Thank you. All right.
