Stefan Guyou, a QA analyst at the Document Foundation, gave a talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 about a project he worked on to complement existing quality assurance (QA) tools for LibreOffice. Guyou used R, a data analysis and statistics software, and the Shiny framework to create a web app with interactive visualizations and tables that link to QA activities. The app allows users to view graphs on severity and priorities of reported bugs, how bugs have been resolved, the first version that was affected, and how unconfirmed bugs have evolved over the years. It also provides a condensed table of bugs on Bugzilla with filters and links to specific versions of LibreOffice. Guyou provided links to existing QA tools and resources and plans to release the app once it is thoroughly tested.
