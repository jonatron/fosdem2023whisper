The speaker discussed the technical aspects of Ubuntu Core, a distro based on Ubuntu builds that targets IoT and uses SNAPs, which are squash fs images with metadata that describe the image's purpose. The system is split into four atomic snaps, including applications, base snaps, a demo snap to handle the installation and an Ubuntu Core kernel snap. The speaker also discussed Trust Measurement Values (TMVs) and how snaps are mounted, configured and updated. The Q&A section involved questions on future plans for Ubuntu Core and the benefits of using SNAPs.
