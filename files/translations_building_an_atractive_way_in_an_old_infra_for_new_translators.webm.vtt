WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.600
Okay. Hi, folks. Thanks for this talk. I wanted also to thanks for them and the organizers

00:13.600 --> 00:21.040
here for this dev room because I'm very happy that the translation to make part of the topics

00:21.040 --> 00:28.880
in such an important event. So it's a very good news, I think. Well, I wanted to propose this

00:28.880 --> 00:37.440
talk because, well, personally, I have started Free Software in 2004 and I have done some

00:37.440 --> 00:45.840
contributions to the Debian project for a long time, but I only started translation in this project.

00:46.640 --> 00:58.000
I have started that since 2018. Well, I told myself, how could we help new contributors,

00:58.000 --> 01:06.480
new users, new potential commerce, to help the translations team with the capabilities that

01:06.480 --> 01:13.360
Debian can provide for them and also with what Debian can't provide. And it's also what we're

01:13.360 --> 01:19.920
going to see and we're going to see why it's not so easy, actually. And so I told myself also,

01:19.920 --> 01:26.560
well, I'm sure some people think that, oh, but why Debian doesn't use modern tools such as wood

01:26.560 --> 01:35.200
lights such as modern for editors or things like that. And so I had the thought about that.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.200
And to myself, well, why not share that with people to understand why Debian works like that

01:43.200 --> 01:51.840
and how a user, a new user could contribute with this way of working and without no problem and

01:51.840 --> 02:00.160
without problems with satisfaction. So the example I take is, of course, this is a French

02:00.160 --> 02:06.800
translation team because it's the team I know the best, of course. It's a very small team.

02:07.760 --> 02:14.720
And it's a very, very small team. As you see, there are few people. There have been people

02:14.720 --> 02:22.240
for a long time, but it's never a team with 10 or 20 persons. No, it's a very, very small team. And

02:22.240 --> 02:30.000
also it's not a team which have a lot of technical skills. I mean, there are some Debian developers

02:30.000 --> 02:38.560
but which are technical, they are one or two. And most other Debian developers of this team are

02:38.560 --> 02:45.120
not uploaders. That is, they don't or they are not considered or they are not considered themselves

02:45.120 --> 02:51.040
able to do uploads of new packages or things like that. So it's not a technical team. It's

02:52.400 --> 03:01.120
really a translation team and not a technical team. And amazing results are produced by this

03:01.120 --> 03:08.800
team. I mean that it's a very small team but very amazing results exist. For example, we have

03:09.360 --> 03:16.240
all the things we translate and we know that we are the third language best translated in the

03:16.240 --> 03:23.760
project. And when we see the amount of work which is needed to get that, I think the team may be

03:23.760 --> 03:31.120
very, very happy. And I can say it because I don't make part of all the team and I don't make part of

03:31.120 --> 03:38.000
these projects. So congratulations to other members of the staff. So the websites, the installer,

03:38.720 --> 03:46.000
all the things which are translated from up to nearly 100%, the Debian package descriptions

03:46.000 --> 03:54.800
which are not translated, of course, very much. But the most important are translated and it's

03:54.800 --> 04:01.840
very important for us also to enable French users to get the package description, at least for those

04:01.840 --> 04:11.920
they have more chance to use. So I think it's very amazing results when we know the real size of

04:11.920 --> 04:23.760
the team. Then we work for a project which has been a very long history, as you know. The first

04:23.760 --> 04:29.520
message, I was very happy to discover that preparing this talk. The first message of the

04:29.520 --> 04:38.480
Debian translation team for French is in 1998. It's very old. The world has changed very much

04:38.480 --> 04:47.120
since this year, of course. And in particular, the technical world. So of course, the process,

04:47.120 --> 04:56.480
the workflow is made based today. And we have web pages, web pages which enable to have a tracking

04:56.480 --> 05:02.320
of the situations and to have some statistics and to have some information. Some bots who

05:02.320 --> 05:09.200
automate some things and also some statistics. And some made-based to have a workflow between the

05:09.200 --> 05:20.240
members of the team to ensure that the translation has a good quality. The tools, as I said, are

05:20.240 --> 05:27.840
made-based. That is, on the Debian mailing list, the Debian mailing list for the team, the French

05:27.840 --> 05:37.840
in the French team, there is a bot who is able to receive the topics, the subject of the messages

05:37.840 --> 05:45.760
sent by the member of the list to pass them and to produce statistics from this and to produce

05:45.760 --> 05:52.880
some status of the packages or the pages we are translating. So it's very important, of course,

05:52.880 --> 05:59.680
because it enables all the members of the team to know if, for example, someone is working on

05:59.680 --> 06:06.640
something or the status of something if it's up-to-date or if it's not up-to-date or other

06:06.640 --> 06:16.080
information like that. So the thing, of course, is, well, what can we do with the made-based

06:16.080 --> 06:22.240
process given the number of things we have to do? Well, we track the changes. So it's very

06:22.240 --> 06:32.080
important. We can know the status of the translations. And even if we've stopped working for a long time,

06:32.080 --> 06:37.840
we are able, easily, to join the team again and to know what's the situation and what about

06:37.840 --> 06:47.600
the situation. There are also coordination pages. So with the tracking pages, which enable to do

06:47.600 --> 06:55.600
that. So we have the announces for the websites. We have the package translated via profiles.

06:55.600 --> 07:03.600
Packages are translated because they are classical programs. So they have this, they use GetText

07:03.600 --> 07:10.400
as many programs today. Also descriptions, also depth course screens. Depth course, of course,

07:10.400 --> 07:14.960
the screens that the user gets when he's installing a package to set some configuration at the

07:14.960 --> 07:23.520
installation time. And the website, of course, which is a very high work. So I think the problem

07:23.520 --> 07:31.840
of the Dibian project and the reason for which it's probably very difficult to use automated tools

07:32.880 --> 07:42.240
is that there is a lot of formats which are used as inputs and also outputs.

07:42.240 --> 07:48.880
I mean, inputs, we have at least a packages description database, which has some formats. I'm

07:48.880 --> 07:55.520
not sure I know what it is about, but it's not a format such as po-files or HTML files. It's another

07:55.520 --> 08:03.360
kind of format. It's a database. HTML, of course, and the po-files. And for the outputs, we need to

08:03.360 --> 08:09.440
produce, of course, some translations, some classical, typical translations we find in any other kind

08:09.440 --> 08:19.840
of programs of free software, but also the websites, so HTML pages. And various other formats. So

08:20.720 --> 08:29.840
it's not so easy to ship that in a kind of automated tool because it's really a really

08:29.840 --> 08:37.200
quite big task of administration to set that initially. And I remember that in the team,

08:37.200 --> 08:45.600
we have not a lot of technical skills and we are not very numerous. So we can understand that we

08:45.600 --> 08:51.600
prefer going out with males, even if it's probably not perfect, but at least it enables people to

08:51.600 --> 08:57.600
work. While changing to another kind of tools, even if it would have benefits about the interface

08:57.600 --> 09:03.440
and the user experience, it would be really a challenge, a very important challenge.

09:03.440 --> 09:10.880
So changing is very difficult. Is it a good idea also? It's an idea that the team wonders sometimes.

09:10.880 --> 09:19.600
Is it a good idea? We wonder that in particular because that's right, there are not a lot of

09:19.600 --> 09:28.160
new contributors if we have a look annually. However, when people come and contribute to the

09:28.160 --> 09:34.160
translation project in Debian, they stay with us. They don't leave us. So probably it means that

09:34.160 --> 09:42.640
once we manage to adopt the tools, to adopt the process, we like it and people are comfortable

09:42.640 --> 09:54.160
with it. So even if it's not modern, once you take the care to learn it, at the end, I think we can

09:54.160 --> 10:04.160
be comfortable with that. In particular because, well, we can get things offline. In particular

10:04.160 --> 10:10.160
because we can take the poll and do some stupid things without being sure you are not breaking

10:10.160 --> 10:15.360
all of the process or you are not breaking all the translation of others. So I think it gives

10:15.360 --> 10:24.800
some benefits that people are happy to have. And that's the reason for which moving is difficult.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.680
Because people are happy and we are not absolutely sure that changing that would be a good idea.

10:31.840 --> 10:38.080
And when we try changing, for example, we try to migrate the server for the package description

10:38.080 --> 10:44.880
to another server in Debian, it takes a year and it exhausted some people. So I'm not sure it's

10:44.880 --> 10:51.680
the best idea we can have, even if this migration was really important. But imagine if we should

10:51.680 --> 11:01.440
have a migration with more impact and more things to address. So instead of changing things,

11:02.880 --> 11:09.440
I suggest to propose to the users, to the new contributors, a kind of approach

11:09.440 --> 11:18.640
which enables everyone to, well, let's discover the project. Let's discover the interactions

11:18.640 --> 11:25.040
you can have with the team from the easiest to the most complex. And from this basis,

11:27.280 --> 11:37.760
do your way, follow your way. And the first step, for example, is for, and also, yes,

11:37.760 --> 11:42.800
on every step on the way, the idea is also to have two kind of status. The two kind of

11:42.800 --> 11:48.240
status, we are going to talk about that again in a few minutes, but it's more or less, okay,

11:48.800 --> 11:54.320
either I am a reviewer and I start to understand all the conventions of the team, how the team

11:54.320 --> 12:01.680
works, et cetera, or I become a translator myself. And of course, I start to contribute

12:01.680 --> 12:09.920
with other translators. So it's a way to contribute for the rhythm of everybody.

12:12.160 --> 12:17.120
I suggest that the first thing you can do if you want to contribute, because again,

12:17.120 --> 12:23.200
there are not some tools which are attractive, but also start with the easy thing. And translating

12:23.200 --> 12:30.240
the wiki pages of Debian, for example, would be an easy thing because much people love to use a wiki,

12:30.240 --> 12:37.840
it's not so difficult to use. And using a wiki today is, well, okay, you take the page,

12:37.840 --> 12:42.320
you cut and paste the contents, you create a new page on the French wiki, and well,

12:42.320 --> 12:48.480
and it's done. So it's not so complicated to do. And it's the first step which,

12:50.240 --> 12:57.360
well, creates a kind of initiation training for the translation. We saw so much consequences

12:57.360 --> 13:03.920
for the project because it's not an official resource, but it's a community resource. It's not

13:03.920 --> 13:10.160
a resource maintained by Debian members, so it's not a big problem if you do some mistakes or

13:10.160 --> 13:17.760
things like that. The next step is probably the package descriptions. It's interesting because

13:17.760 --> 13:23.120
there are a lot of responsibilities because, well, package descriptions are what users will see on

13:23.120 --> 13:29.120
their screen when they will see it for a package. However, the interface is simple. It's a web

13:29.120 --> 13:35.120
interface which is, well, there are some conventions, there are some rules to have, but there are also

13:35.120 --> 13:40.720
a first contact with the translation team. And it's something which is important because we have

13:40.720 --> 13:48.240
people who review what you're doing. So you can do what you do, what Debian used to do. And for

13:48.240 --> 13:52.880
example, if you try to translate some things like that, but Debian is used to translate

13:52.880 --> 13:59.520
differently, you will know that. If you're not compliant with some kind of syntax or kind of

13:59.520 --> 14:06.640
a way to introduce things, it will be said by the member of the team. So it's a first responsibility,

14:06.640 --> 14:11.600
a first contact with the team, but it's a simple interface without needing to understand something.

14:12.240 --> 14:17.440
So I think it's very interesting for that because it's a good point of beginning and

14:17.440 --> 14:24.720
especially what I like in the package description tools is that it's very short. At least you

14:24.720 --> 14:30.480
take some packages, such as latex, or of course latex, when you start translating the description

14:30.480 --> 14:37.600
of latex packages, it's less fun. At least sometimes 2,000 lines for a description.

14:39.360 --> 14:42.880
It's somewhat difficult. But if you translate some more

14:42.880 --> 14:49.280
typical packages, it may be very short. And you can do one package a day, for example. So you can

14:49.280 --> 14:56.400
do really at your rhythm, to learn at your rhythm, and not, well, with a minimum follow-up also.

14:57.200 --> 15:03.920
So I think it's the first step, which is very interesting. The next step could be the

15:03.920 --> 15:10.080
depth course screens on your way of a newcomer. So depth course screens is another thing because

15:10.080 --> 15:16.000
now you'll have to post your translations proposals on the mailing list and to go in the process.

15:16.800 --> 15:22.000
So to understand the virtual address that we made in the topic and the subject of the message,

15:22.000 --> 15:27.600
to be sure that the robot is able to understand what you're doing and to report that in the

15:27.600 --> 15:33.200
following, in the tracking stats, in the tracking tables. So it's a bit more difficult, but well,

15:33.200 --> 15:38.240
you start having an experience of the Debian ecosystem. So we can consider that maybe you're

15:38.240 --> 15:44.400
ready to understand that. Maybe you will meet someone physically. We will explain to you how

15:44.400 --> 15:52.560
things work. And, well, depth course, okay, you are going to now intend to translate requests for

15:52.560 --> 16:00.000
review, last chance for a contributor for review. So you are going to really come in the process,

16:00.000 --> 16:06.480
to come in the Debian process, and to start contributing to really important things also.

16:06.480 --> 16:12.640
And it's the first responsibility in the process of Debian with the mail, working, etc., etc.

16:14.720 --> 16:21.200
And once you are completely comfortable with that, so the process is also here with coordination

16:21.200 --> 16:28.240
of the packages, with the messages which mention their status, and once the mail is received,

16:28.240 --> 16:33.360
of course, you can translate your things, you translate your profiles with your own editor.

16:33.360 --> 16:39.360
With your own editor, why not on WebLate? Because I saw that WebLate can become a

16:39.360 --> 16:45.600
dictionary of translations while using its own editor. You test the results, you also can do

16:45.600 --> 16:52.560
that. You report when you finished and when the team is okay with your translation. You report

16:52.560 --> 16:58.960
the bug to upstream, to the package maintainer, sorry, so package maintainer, and it puts the

16:58.960 --> 17:06.240
profile in the package. And the benefits of that is you use your preferred text editor, as I said,

17:06.240 --> 17:13.200
or also your PoEditor, PoEdit or localize as some editors on KDE which work very much for that,

17:13.920 --> 17:19.200
to identify in particular the fuzzy strings or the translating strings.

17:20.880 --> 17:27.520
Yes, because I forgot to precise some important things also, is that if we should use some WebLate

17:27.520 --> 17:32.000
interface on something like that, there is another problem for some contributors like me,

17:32.000 --> 17:38.960
is their accessibility problems. So it would prevent persons to contribute due to accessibility

17:38.960 --> 17:45.200
problems. With this method, and like you can use some users, personally I use Emacs with GetText,

17:46.240 --> 17:50.640
it's easy because it's in text and there are not problems related to accessibility.

17:50.640 --> 17:58.960
Well, once you are comfortable with that, maybe you'll want to contribute to the

17:58.960 --> 18:04.160
effort of the Debian community to contribute to main pages. Map pages is a big project,

18:04.720 --> 18:13.680
2,000 pages about, and a lot of updates, so it's a big project. But the good thing is the method

18:13.680 --> 18:19.680
is the same. So you clone the Git, you translate the profiles, you are on the mailing list with the

18:19.680 --> 18:26.800
topics, the virtual topics, to follow the process, and when it's finished, you commit,

18:26.800 --> 18:33.120
or you make someone in the team to commit. So you know the process, you know how it works,

18:33.120 --> 18:39.440
you know the conventions in Debian. So now you are able to contribute to any project based on

18:39.440 --> 18:45.840
poll files, even if it's not some, well, some packages themselves, but you can do main pages,

18:45.840 --> 18:50.160
you can do package description, you can do package, Debian packages themselves,

18:50.160 --> 18:54.000
so it becomes for you easy to contribute because you understand the process,

18:54.000 --> 19:04.240
and also the human beings in the community. Well, the benefits of the main pages is that

19:04.240 --> 19:12.080
well, just translate and discuss. You don't have any maintenance to do because German team does that

19:12.080 --> 19:19.360
and does that very good. So it's a very, a new area, which is accessible for everybody,

19:19.360 --> 19:27.760
and which is very cool to use. The next step, and it's useful for the community, of course,

19:27.760 --> 19:34.400
because as you know, main pages, Debian translates that, but we don't translate only for Debian.

19:34.400 --> 19:39.760
We translate for all the communities because main pages are used in all the distributions.

19:39.760 --> 19:45.920
So also this translation is a way for you to contribute for all the community.

19:48.400 --> 19:54.800
Then you have documentation, the Debian specific documentation. So related to the Debian software,

19:55.600 --> 20:00.800
we have the release notes, of course, we have the Debian developers reference, etc., etc.,

20:00.800 --> 20:06.720
but also now it's only poll files. So it's not so difficult to understand how it works and the

20:06.720 --> 20:12.480
process to have a review and to have a quality assurance by the community of the translators.

20:14.000 --> 20:21.200
And packages, same thing, in interaction with the community, we can also now translate all the

20:21.200 --> 20:28.000
things. According to your time, you will choose one of these projects or just translate for one,

20:28.000 --> 20:32.240
two, three, or all those projects, according to the time and the energy you have.

20:32.240 --> 20:41.840
The analysis also, of course, it starts being a bit different, just like the website, because you

20:41.840 --> 20:49.120
will start to play with HTML. So it starts to be different. It's a new area. And I think

20:49.760 --> 20:55.360
starting with package descriptions avoids any difficulty from a technical point of view.

20:55.360 --> 21:03.200
Then poll files, it starts making you in front of the difficulty of the process, but, well,

21:03.200 --> 21:12.560
okay, the process is done. And to finish, you come to HTML pages where it may seem for some

21:12.560 --> 21:18.560
people somewhat difficult, because, well, you have to address tags and many things that you

21:18.560 --> 21:24.400
have on an HTML page. So it may be somewhat difficult. And, however, it's important because

21:24.400 --> 21:30.560
on the website, we have the security analysis, we have the publicity, we have all the platform for

21:30.560 --> 21:38.080
the Debian project leader. So it may become important. And for any of these steps, you can,

21:38.080 --> 21:43.600
of course, take the time, for example, to take three years to package descriptions and then wait

21:43.600 --> 21:49.760
still three years for main pages, et cetera, according to your rhythm and your energy. And

21:49.760 --> 21:57.040
especially, you can do what you want, review or translating. Generally, when arriving,

21:57.600 --> 22:02.720
we suggest to review, to understand the conventions, to understand the things and to not

22:02.720 --> 22:07.360
to take some time in your life. Then if you want to contribute to translating directly,

22:07.360 --> 22:16.400
it's a good idea. What I mean here is that we can do really at the, well, with the ways,

22:16.400 --> 22:21.600
with minimum ways and minimum installations and a minimum understanding things and especially on

22:21.600 --> 22:29.200
the progressive ways. Also, you can track in translations. So you subscribe to the mailing

22:29.200 --> 22:34.480
list and you have a look at translations and you follow what happens in matter of review

22:34.480 --> 22:40.720
and in matter of translating new if you consider that it's simple or short enough to make you

22:40.720 --> 22:47.360
spend the time to do it. So review and translating as the two steps, the two steps you can do at

22:47.360 --> 22:56.400
any time in the process and in your way on Debian. So to conclude, I would say that it's not an

22:56.400 --> 23:01.520
automated process because we don't have the capability to do that. And I think the project

23:01.520 --> 23:08.000
is too complex today to do that efficiently. And it would imply some engineering to do things

23:08.000 --> 23:17.920
properly. But we have today some way, I think, and it's what I try to suggest on the Wiki pages

23:17.920 --> 23:23.360
about translation and how to contribute and to start contributing and not being discouraging,

23:23.360 --> 23:30.560
discouraged, I could have been during some years. There is a way from the most obvious,

23:30.560 --> 23:38.000
technically speaking, to less obvious with a contact with the community which is progressive.

23:38.720 --> 23:45.920
And you discover how things work, the conventions, of course. The team discovers also if you are

23:45.920 --> 23:51.680
ready to respect how the team works because we had some contributors which where we've

23:51.680 --> 23:56.640
used it was complicated because they decided to do things like he wanted. Yes, but there is a team,

23:56.640 --> 24:04.080
a history, so you can't do things as you want. Even if you're right, take the time and respect

24:04.080 --> 24:12.960
what other people do. And also, it's important to say that on the mailing list, also, if you start

24:13.840 --> 24:19.520
contributing via the mailing list, you have the chance to get your native language because

24:20.400 --> 24:25.920
in the French mailing list, but also in Italian, in Spanish, or any language, you have for the

24:25.920 --> 24:31.920
translation teams, of course, people speaking your native language. So, for example, now,

24:31.920 --> 24:38.080
how to translate this English term in the language, it may be useful. And, for example,

24:38.080 --> 24:44.400
in the package description, we also have a glossary to help people to know, okay, this English word

24:44.400 --> 24:50.240
which has a strange translation, should I translate, or if I shouldn't translate, what should I do

24:50.240 --> 24:56.000
with that? And if I should translate, what kind of word is used usually? And once you do that,

24:56.000 --> 25:02.480
you can learn. And also, without any complicated tools or with no difficulties,

25:02.480 --> 25:07.440
you can start translating. And so, you can become a deviant translator. Thanks.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.440
Oops.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.960
If you have some feedback or some questions.

25:24.560 --> 25:31.440
For me, I can answer a feedback, a global feedback, a kind of policy feedback because

25:31.440 --> 25:38.320
I have seen that maybe there is a fragmentation in different distributions in Linux, and some

25:38.320 --> 25:50.080
have an advantage, and also not for this website. And so, because I never found a distribution

25:50.080 --> 25:57.840
that convinced me perfectly. For instance, for me, you have problems with vision, but for me,

25:57.840 --> 26:04.240
I have little problems with vision agronomy. And so, I should appreciate the scrolling bar

26:04.240 --> 26:12.000
with a great enlarge, not a line to be picked up to adjust and sort of like that.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.360
I have some problems like that. It makes Linux, they have a good scrolling bar,

26:17.360 --> 26:26.320
but also problems. So, it's a kind, I'd like to wish more cooperation

26:26.320 --> 26:32.320
with Linux, there was a problem of system day also, something like that. But I think it's

26:32.320 --> 26:44.000
important for Linux community in general to have a better cooperation with different projects.

26:46.320 --> 26:51.920
I think that the importance is free software, even if what you say is right, I'm okay with that.

26:51.920 --> 26:57.760
But according to my understanding of things and about translation, it's right also,

26:58.400 --> 27:06.880
is that the user finds a way for himself. I mean, that's, okay, Debian has his way of work,

27:07.680 --> 27:12.400
human too has his way of work, and any project has his way of work according to the history,

27:12.400 --> 27:19.840
according to what it needs to be done, et cetera. Well, the thing is how to enable a user to find

27:19.840 --> 27:26.160
among all the existing ways a way for him. And I think it's right for any new users,

27:26.160 --> 27:32.080
that's actually what you're saying, but also it's right for new contributors, because contributing

27:32.080 --> 27:38.800
may work according to some rules, some community interactions, some tools, of course. So, it's

27:38.800 --> 27:45.360
not a kind of what is better, what is not better, it's only a kind of is it sweet for you, actually.

27:45.360 --> 27:51.440
And in the community, the benefit is that you have this diversity, which enables you to decide

27:51.440 --> 27:56.800
what is good for you and what is good for your way of doing things. So, it's a good thing.

27:56.800 --> 28:01.200
But yes, there are a lot of ways, and to find the way good for you is not easy.

28:01.200 --> 28:16.080
I think the Delian community has something very good on which we should all learn to do is you

28:16.080 --> 28:21.840
have a very good translation workflow, and I think this is something valuable, and this is the reason

28:21.840 --> 28:32.560
why you are able to continue doing some e-mail translation still, even if the world is using

28:33.760 --> 28:41.600
much different workflow, and I think that your bigger value is this. And my question would be,

28:43.200 --> 28:47.520
what are the limitations that you see in the existing translation platform,

28:47.520 --> 28:57.520
in terms of accessibility for you who are blind, but also in terms of way to collaborate as a team,

28:58.320 --> 29:06.480
because I did a push for web late in many places, it helps a lot, but it doesn't create any miracle.

29:07.520 --> 29:13.920
The community needs to find a way to define the workflow, the way to collaborate together,

29:13.920 --> 29:18.480
and this is something that the rest of the open source community can learn from the Delian community.

29:19.120 --> 29:24.320
Your tools are a little bit play-stricken, but you are in a way of working, are very clear,

29:24.320 --> 29:30.080
and easy to understand, and I would be interesting to have your feedback on the translation

29:30.080 --> 29:37.200
platform in terms of accessibility, and what are lacking to have a proper collaboration as a team

29:37.200 --> 29:45.440
in what you have today. Thanks, because you sum up what I want to show here. What you say

29:45.440 --> 29:51.600
is exactly what I think and I want to show, but I know, and I'm aware from some feedbacks I can

29:51.600 --> 29:59.920
have, and because I know there is a low stream of new, a low flow of new contributors, that maybe,

29:59.920 --> 30:04.320
and I say maybe because I'm not sure myself about that, because for me it, indeed, what

30:04.320 --> 30:10.400
the tools we are using now are perfect because they are accessible, because they work, and because

30:10.400 --> 30:16.320
they enable to have a record and to have a team collaboration, so for me these tools are really

30:16.320 --> 30:23.360
perfect, but in the new generation of new contributors, I know that indeed there are some

30:23.360 --> 30:32.960
more friendly interfaces, some more design, some ways to do a UI and UX, which is more

30:32.960 --> 30:39.440
beautiful and more friendly, more attractive, more, also, or you have a less learning curve, so

30:39.440 --> 30:44.240
you can come in the project, do something, up to leave, no problem, you don't have to learn during

30:44.240 --> 30:50.080
some months, some things, et cetera, et cetera, so also the problem today is the new contributors

30:50.080 --> 30:56.720
in the society is that people want, doesn't want less, want to get involved on the long term,

30:56.720 --> 31:01.040
they want to come to try something, give it a try, up and to leave, because well, we have our

31:01.040 --> 31:04.800
lives, we have our obligations, et cetera, and that's right in Debian, it's something more

31:04.800 --> 31:09.520
difficult, because in libraries, for example, you can go, okay, you have an error or a mistake on

31:09.520 --> 31:14.720
the string, you open the web later, up, you fix the string, up, and you leave away, and perfect,

31:14.720 --> 31:19.200
well, in Debian, it's not possible, well, it's possible for the package description, because

31:19.200 --> 31:23.920
it's a web interface, there is not a learning curve, it's very simple, but for people who don't

31:23.920 --> 31:30.000
want to do the effort to learn, we don't want to do the effort of understanding deeply things,

31:30.000 --> 31:36.080
well, it may be destructive. Is it a bad news? I don't know, I'm not sure, but the fact is that

31:36.080 --> 31:40.640
the team is small, and the fact is that we have not few contributors, so I wonder if it's an

31:40.640 --> 31:47.680
limitation, but for contributors who try their best to do that, I think these tools are, indeed,

31:47.680 --> 31:48.720
are really, really perfect.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.560
Yeah, just one more question for the neutral pinch.

31:54.560 --> 32:02.080
So you've sort of approached us to create new translations, can you give some examples

32:02.080 --> 32:06.880
how you, what you've tried and recipes to update existing translations, like the original text

32:06.880 --> 32:12.480
changes, the English text changes, how to know about this, you notified the same translator as before,

32:13.760 --> 32:15.840
did everybody jump in and change that?

32:15.840 --> 32:31.680
Well, actually, for example, to take the deep core for the main pages, for example,

32:31.680 --> 32:38.240
when there is an update, the translator has a warning, he knows that he has something which is

32:38.240 --> 32:44.000
because the translator is considered as the last one who can do the changes or who should do the

32:44.000 --> 32:51.840
changes. Once he has this warning, either via mail or because he has a look on the statistics page,

32:52.480 --> 32:58.720
he says, okay, so I will do that. So he sends a mail with an address saying that, okay,

32:58.720 --> 33:05.280
this page, this description, this profile, I will translate it. So there is a mail and the

33:05.280 --> 33:11.200
community has the information, is notified that the person is going to translate. After it,

33:11.200 --> 33:19.360
it will translate the profile or the file in it and then said, okay, now I finished, thanks to review

33:19.360 --> 33:26.000
the translation. So there are some review, it's a process which can be on five days or 10 days

33:26.000 --> 33:33.040
according to the number of mistakes which needs to be fixed, et cetera. And at the end, he says,

33:33.040 --> 33:38.480
okay, last chance for change. So, okay, it's the last chance for you to review and to tell me if

33:38.480 --> 33:43.920
there is a problem. And once that's done, when the mail arrives on the community team, if there is

33:43.920 --> 33:51.600
not any reply, well, okay, the translator can either report a bug to say to the maintainer of

33:51.600 --> 33:57.600
the package, okay, there is a new translation, it's updates. Please put it in your package or

33:57.600 --> 34:05.040
you can do it itself, himself or herself, if the person has the permissions to access to the

34:05.040 --> 34:10.720
git and the repository and to do the translation. So it's a manual, but of course there are some

34:10.720 --> 34:16.480
scripts to do that. You don't have to do that manually, it's not a mandatory. But the process

34:16.480 --> 34:35.440
is really, you have a follow-up of the situation via mail. Okay, thank you. Thanks.
