In this talk, Mehdi Bessa presents Bastion Lab, a secure data privacy-friendly framework written in Rust. The framework aims to solve the problem of arbitrary code execution and unauthorized access to sensitive data when sharing critical data. Bastion Lab allows limited operations and only sanitized and authorized output. The API is in Python, but the server is in Rust, chosen for its memory safety, handling of multi-threading, and low call-based size. The framework makes use of Tonic and Tokyo for GRPC protocol, Polar for dataset join aggregation, and rings for verification of public keys. Overall, Bastion Lab offers a secure and efficient solution for sharing critical data.
