The speaker discussed the COIN dependency injection framework and its new developer experience. They explained how COIN helps structure applications and provided examples of how to use COIN's DSL to declare components and inject dependencies. They also introduced annotations as an alternative to the DSL, which can be used with COIN's Kotlin compiler plugin to generate the necessary code for dependency injection. The speaker mentioned some upcoming improvements, such as better support for Kotlin Multiplatform and the introduction of the Verify API. They thanked the COIN community and encouraged further engagement through Twitter, Slack, and the COIN website. The talk concluded with a mention of the speaker's company, COZILLA, which offers support for COIN and Kotlin technologies.
