The talk focused on the Web Application Manager (WAM), which is the LG WAM OS runtime for embedded products built on top of Chromium. WAM focuses on supporting web applications and treating them as first-class citizens on par with native applications. It controls the application lifecycle, optimizes launch time and resource distribution, and offers security and developer tools. WAM is used in LG Smart TVs and has been open-sourced as WebOS Open Source Edition. The talk also discussed the evolution of WAM, including the move away from using Qt Web Engine to a new component called WebOS WebView. The future plans for WAM include using Clang for building, improving upgrade cycles, and staying as the main part of LG's TV offering.
