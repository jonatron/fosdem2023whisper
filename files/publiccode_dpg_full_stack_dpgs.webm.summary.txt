The talk given at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about full-stack digital public goods. The speakers discussed what digital public goods are, the role of the Digital Public Goods Alliance, and how the UNICEF Venture Fund serves as a pipeline for digital public goods. They also introduced the concept of full-stack digital public goods and the challenges faced by the current digital public goods standard. They proposed adding an indicator for sustainability and emphasized the importance of investing in early stage companies and building inclusive and diverse communities. They provided examples of companies at different stages and discussed how Red Hat's Open Source Program Office and UNICEF's mentorship support helped these companies. The talk aimed to inspire curiosity about the measurement of sustainability in digital public goods and promote the idea of full-stack DPGs.
