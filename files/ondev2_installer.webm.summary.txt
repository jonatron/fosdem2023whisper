Oliver Smith talked about the ONDEV2 installer, which is a cross-distribution project used by both PostMarketOS and Mobian for Linux phone installation. ONDEV2 aims to provide a simple and advanced mode for different user preferences during installation. Smith based ONDEV2 on the Unlocker application by Johannes Marbach, which he found useful for keyboard adaptation and small size. ONDEV2 also focuses on making testing and extending easier. ONDEV2 is a work in progress, and Smith discussed plans for supporting other devices, using Wi-Fi to download OS images, and constructing OS images on the fly with package managers.
