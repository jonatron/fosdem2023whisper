[00:00.000 --> 00:13.680]  I'm Hans-Einorichot and I'm the developer community architect for the Document Foundation
[00:13.680 --> 00:14.680]  TDF.
[00:14.680 --> 00:22.800]  Today, I would like to talk about smart art support for LibreOffice.
[00:22.800 --> 00:29.200]  So here's the list of contents that I will talk about here in the stock.
[00:29.520 --> 00:37.560]  Then support status in different aspects from the important display to saving and editing,
[00:37.560 --> 00:43.480]  then audio compatibility and application support.
[00:43.480 --> 00:48.480]  And then I will discuss some of the remaining bugs.
[00:48.480 --> 01:00.880]  So smart art was a feature that was introduced in MSF East 2007 and it is still supported
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.000]  in the newer versions of Microsoft Office.
[01:05.000 --> 01:13.440]  It's a nice way to create complex diagrams with a little effort you type in some text
[01:13.440 --> 01:16.960]  and it is converted into a diagram.
[01:16.960 --> 01:22.360]  You can change the diagram, you can customize it, you can use the same content to have
[01:22.360 --> 01:30.680]  different layers and that is very interesting and because of that the smart art is something
[01:30.680 --> 01:34.440]  that is very popular.
[01:34.440 --> 01:43.640]  So LibreOffice had basic support inherited from the beginning but since then smart art
[01:43.640 --> 01:52.520]  import has received many improvements from many people including Miklos Vajna and Regina
[01:52.520 --> 01:58.360]  Henshel which were the top contributors in this area.
[01:58.360 --> 02:08.360]  You can also see FOSSTEM 2019 presentation from Miklos to get a better understanding.
[02:08.360 --> 02:15.520]  So today I will discuss the details of the status of this support.
[02:15.520 --> 02:21.120]  In the important display I should say the important display is very good.
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.720]  It works nearly perfect.
[02:24.720 --> 02:32.760]  I have tested myself the compatibility with Microsoft Office online with many possible
[02:32.760 --> 02:39.400]  layouts and I have tested around 200 different layouts and configurations that you can use
[02:39.400 --> 02:44.480]  there and the result was very good.
[02:44.480 --> 02:51.000]  I should say in most cases the result is almost the same.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.760]  But when it comes to the saving and editing there are some problems.
[02:56.760 --> 03:07.240]  So saving back to the OXML either it's a Ward or Excel or PowerPoint file is okay even
[03:07.240 --> 03:09.360]  no modification is done.
[03:09.360 --> 03:19.760]  So you can also convert the smart art into a set of shapes but this is a one-day road
[03:19.760 --> 03:21.920]  and you can't go back.
[03:21.920 --> 03:33.960]  So if you open the file inside the Office you will see that sometimes if you enable
[03:33.960 --> 03:44.280]  experimental features in the settings you will see that there is a border with text
[03:44.280 --> 03:48.440]  which shows edit element on the top.
[03:48.440 --> 04:00.560]  This lets you edit the smart art but this editing is very limited and I should say it
[04:00.560 --> 04:08.200]  should be considered very experimental or experimental only and it's not stable at all and also
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.640]  saving back is not possible right now.
[04:10.640 --> 04:15.120]  So it's actually not usable for production.
[04:15.120 --> 04:21.640]  But there is an ongoing effort by Armandagrand to improve this.
[04:21.640 --> 04:30.160]  The effort is installed right now but I hope that they will see the results in the future.
[04:30.160 --> 04:38.200]  So when it comes to audio compatibility the compatibility is non-existent yet.
[04:38.200 --> 04:47.840]  So it's not possible to save a smart to ODF although you can do the saving and you can
[04:47.840 --> 04:54.880]  save the file into ODP or things like that.
[04:54.880 --> 05:01.640]  The saving will do a conversion to shapes so there is no going back to smart art but
[05:01.640 --> 05:08.320]  you can move and edit the shapes and that's not something desirable.
[05:08.320 --> 05:17.920]  So the development path is that we should define similar constructs in ODF and hopefully
[05:17.920 --> 05:24.400]  standardize it and then create routing for loading, saving and conversion from OXML to
[05:24.400 --> 05:29.480]  ODF and back and forth.
[05:29.480 --> 05:40.320]  In the application support, writer is supported, in-person is supported but you can't open
[05:40.320 --> 05:43.760]  the smart art that is created inside Calc.
[05:43.760 --> 05:48.080]  So this is something that is still lacking.
[05:48.080 --> 05:57.560]  And talking about the remaining bugs, we have around 25 bugs in the meta bug dedicated to
[05:57.560 --> 05:59.400]  smart art.
[05:59.400 --> 06:06.200]  These are mostly minor problems with text rendering, positioning, spacing, font color,
[06:06.200 --> 06:08.200]  rotation, things like that.
[06:08.200 --> 06:15.600]  I should say that these problems does not always happen and sometimes we see rendering
[06:15.600 --> 06:24.480]  defects but this is not something that always happens and only sometimes we see these problems
[06:24.480 --> 06:35.400]  and although the rendering is not exactly pixel by pixel, the same with Microsoft Office,
[06:35.400 --> 06:38.360]  the result is usually good.
[06:38.360 --> 06:47.000]  And there's also problems with old MS Office support prior to MS Office 2016 and also the
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.840]  lack of being able to show 3D layouts.
[06:50.840 --> 07:01.080]  So in the text rendering, as you see here, sometimes the output is not similar.
[07:01.080 --> 07:07.280]  For example, spacing, either paragraph spacing or character spacing or different fonts and
[07:07.280 --> 07:18.080]  different metrics, the colors sometimes different and there's also sometimes problems with rotation.
[07:18.080 --> 07:21.840]  And also we see minor problems in rendering.
[07:21.840 --> 07:31.800]  So as you can see, as the arrows show, there are little differences and I hope that the
[07:31.800 --> 07:36.280]  bugs can be fixed in the near future.
[07:36.280 --> 07:39.840]  So 3D layouts are also not supported.
[07:39.840 --> 07:44.200]  Also the output is still meaningful.
[07:44.200 --> 07:48.720]  And I should say that sometimes LibRaf is even thus better.
[07:48.720 --> 07:56.640]  For example, if you look at what arrows show, the spacing and the internationalized text,
[07:56.640 --> 08:04.280]  which is bidirectional for Arabic and Persian, is better, even better in LibRaf is compared
[08:04.280 --> 08:06.400]  to MS Office.
[08:06.400 --> 08:08.280]  So is there any questions?
[08:08.280 --> 08:10.840]  I would be happy to answer.
[08:10.840 --> 08:11.240]  Thank you.
