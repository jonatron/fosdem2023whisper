The speaker talks about their work in the measurement and diagnostics department of SBB, where they focus on maintaining the safety of the train system and gathering data for predictive maintenance. They discuss the complexities of track geometry measurement and introduce their open data format called RCMDX, which is based on the HDF5 standard. They also present their open-source viewing software called RCM Viewer, which allows for the display and analysis of the gathered data. The speaker highlights the benefits of using their open data format and viewing software, including the possibility of creating a standard across different countries. They mention that the viewing software is currently available as freeware and will be released as open source in the future. The speaker also mentions the use of proprietary libraries and their efforts to find a way to use open source while keeping those libraries. They conclude by inviting the audience to visit SBB's project website and download the viewing software and sample data.
