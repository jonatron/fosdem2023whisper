In this talk, the speaker discusses the potential threat that cloud computing poses to free and open source software. They argue that while free software has democratized access to code, actually operationalizing and running the software has become a new proprietary differentiator, even on top of free software. They explain that this undermines the usefulness and sustainability of free software as the knowledge and expertise required to run complex software in the cloud becomes increasingly proprietary. The speaker calls for expanding the concept of free and open source software to include the operationalization of the code and creating a collaborative, decentralized infrastructure model that allows for the running of services without dependency on large centralized providers. The speaker also suggests that a cultural change is needed, where users appreciate the benefits of decentralization and are willing to put in the extra effort to create and use alternative platforms. Overall, the talk highlights the need to reclaim sovereignty and control over technology in a cloud-dominated world.
