The speaker discusses their experience with contributing to the Debian project's translation team and explores ways in which new contributors can help with translations. They highlight the achievements of the small French translation team within Debian, despite its limited technical skills. The speaker acknowledges that the adoption of automated translation tools would be challenging due to the various formats used in Debian's inputs and outputs. Instead, they propose a progressive approach for new contributors, starting with easy tasks like translating wiki pages and gradually moving on to more complex translations. The speaker emphasizes the importance of learning the conventions and understanding the team's workflow. They also suggest that using familiar text editors can help contributors feel more comfortable. The speaker concludes by acknowledging that while there may be more modern and user-friendly tools available, the existing process works well for the team and encourages new contributors to find their own way within the project.
