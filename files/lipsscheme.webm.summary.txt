The talk discusses Lisp and Scheme, its history and basic concepts. The speaker also introduces Lips, an implementation of Scheme written in JavaScript, highlighting its features such as introspection and extensibility. The talk includes a live demo showcasing the flexibility and power of Lips but also acknowledges its limitations. The speaker suggests that some issues can be fixed by embedding JavaScript code in Lips, but there is still room for improvement, such as adding first call continuations and tail call optimizations.
