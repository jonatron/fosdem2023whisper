In this FOSDEM talk, Johannes Bergberg, a JVM developer at SAP, discusses his work with the Firefox profiler beyond the web, allowing the profiler to view Java profiling data. Bergberg was initially seeking open source tools for debugging but found the visualizations to be insufficient. He created the Java JFR profiler plugin, integrating the Firefox profiler in his work. Bergberg details the JFR file format and how to use his open source tool to profile Java applications with Firefox, including arbitrary JFR files. Bergberg states that he would appreciate user feedback, as this is a prototype, and hopes to implement new features, such as the ability to configure a server.
