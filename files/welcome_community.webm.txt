[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  We are now slowly counting down to 9 a.m. Please take this opportunity to rustle any
[00:11.480 --> 00:16.600]  plastic that may be around your muffin before we get started.
[00:16.600 --> 00:20.440]  You can also rustle your plastic around the muffin during the sessions I have been told
[00:20.440 --> 00:22.440]  and it will all be okay.
[00:22.440 --> 00:25.240]  All right.
[00:25.240 --> 00:29.680]  A wonderful good morning and happy time zone for those who may be tuning in from elsewhere
[00:29.680 --> 00:34.960]  in the world on the live stream and welcome to the community Dev Room for Fosdham 2023.
[00:34.960 --> 00:36.280]  My name is Leslie Hawthorne.
[00:36.280 --> 00:41.840]  I am very proud to be one of the co-organizers of the community Dev Room along with Laura
[00:41.840 --> 00:47.200]  Chikowsky right there and Shirley Bales who is at the back.
[00:47.200 --> 00:51.040]  We would also like to express our sincere thanks to our additional members of our program
[00:51.040 --> 00:55.520]  committee this year, Samson Goody and Claire Dillon who helped us to review the submissions
[00:55.520 --> 00:57.240]  to the Dev Room.
[00:57.240 --> 01:00.520]  Just a few housekeeping remarks before we get started for our day.
[01:00.520 --> 01:04.200]  We will have refreshments available throughout the day as long as they last.
[01:04.200 --> 01:08.120]  For the baked goods, the vegan baked goods are marked with a dark colored ribbon and
[01:08.120 --> 01:12.640]  the vegetarian baked goods are marked with a light colored ribbon.
[01:12.640 --> 01:18.120]  And the community Dev Room is thankful to the Free Software Foundation Europe and the
[01:18.120 --> 01:22.160]  folks running the legal and policy Dev Room for providing us with air filtration for our
[01:22.160 --> 01:23.160]  Dev Room today.
[01:23.160 --> 01:27.000]  They were kind enough to leave their machines behind for us to use.
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.840]  If you are not feeling well, obviously please mask.
[01:30.840 --> 01:35.520]  We have several masks available if you need one and they are the kind that allow you to
[01:35.520 --> 01:39.160]  have a little bit more ease with respiration throughout the day if that is a challenge
[01:39.160 --> 01:41.000]  for you.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.760]  Our community Dev Room is run under the FOSDEM code of conduct.
[01:44.760 --> 01:48.120]  If there are any concerns that you have during your time in the Dev Room today, please feel
[01:48.120 --> 01:53.680]  free to see me in person or to reach out to conduct at FOSDEM.org.
[01:53.680 --> 01:58.720]  There is also a phone number on the FOSDEM website for reaching out for code of conduct
[01:58.720 --> 01:59.720]  questions.
[01:59.720 --> 02:03.480]  Sadly, I don't have it available right this moment in time, but you will find it on the
[02:03.480 --> 02:08.200]  FOSDEM.org site.
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.000]  I think that's about it other than to say I'm really excited that we can all finally be
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.480]  back together in person for this event and I'm really glad you're all here.
[02:16.480 --> 02:20.320]  So thank you and thank you to those folks joining us from the live stream.
[02:20.320 --> 02:22.800]  We're going to have a number of talks today.
[02:22.800 --> 02:27.880]  I won't be introducing speakers in between each session, but we will have brief housekeeping
[02:27.880 --> 02:32.400]  remarks throughout the day as the room fills up.
[02:32.400 --> 02:35.640]  And we have three minutes before Matt is supposed to get started.
[02:35.640 --> 02:41.000]  So for folks who may be tuning into the live stream, we will now need to be entertaining
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.560]  for the next three minutes.
[02:42.560 --> 02:45.720]  Matt, are you entertaining?
[02:45.720 --> 02:48.440]  I can be very entertaining if you need to be.
[02:48.440 --> 02:49.440]  Excellent.
[02:49.440 --> 02:50.440]  Well, let's try it.
[02:50.440 --> 02:55.560]  I don't have any ferns for us to sit between two ferns, but what is our topic du jour,
[02:55.560 --> 02:56.560]  sir?
[02:56.560 --> 03:00.640]  Today I'm going to be talking about external evangelists and how to build external evangelists.
[03:00.640 --> 03:01.640]  Okay.
[03:01.640 --> 03:04.640]  Well, we all like it when people want to talk about how cool our things are.
[03:04.640 --> 03:09.280]  So I think Matt's advice will be deeply fulfilling to us and useful in our quest.
[03:09.280 --> 03:12.320]  I'm so glad that the streams are live.
[03:12.320 --> 03:15.720]  Do we get the little wink-a-wink-a cat in here?
[03:15.720 --> 03:22.480]  No, you can't be, it's only the slides up, but so if you want to, I'd like to...
[03:22.480 --> 03:23.480]  Hi, everybody.
[03:23.480 --> 03:24.480]  Well, that's excellent.
[03:24.480 --> 03:30.520]  If you're going to do anything embarrassing, do it over here where you're off-camera and
[03:30.520 --> 03:37.520]  there will be no photojournalistic evidence of the situation.
[03:37.520 --> 03:40.600]  We could play ask the audience awkward questions.
[03:40.600 --> 03:41.600]  We could do that.
[03:41.600 --> 03:44.240]  We could do karaoke just to annoy my friend Brian.
[03:44.240 --> 03:45.240]  Yeah.
[03:45.240 --> 03:46.840]  How many people went out drinking last night?
[03:46.840 --> 03:47.840]  No.
[03:47.840 --> 03:48.840]  No.
[03:48.840 --> 03:52.320]  That's right because that's the correct answer because everyone who did isn't here yet.
[03:52.320 --> 03:53.320]  Yes.
[03:53.320 --> 03:57.080]  I was going to say we here in the community of Devereux Valley were responsible morning
[03:57.080 --> 03:59.080]  start where you're not feeling ill.
[03:59.080 --> 04:00.080]  Yes.
[04:00.080 --> 04:03.880]  When we go to sit with our fellow humans in community.
[04:03.880 --> 04:07.320]  You know, it was funny though because last night I was seeing so many people, I want
[04:07.320 --> 04:08.320]  to see you do this talk.
[04:08.320 --> 04:09.320]  It sounds good, sounds good.
[04:09.320 --> 04:11.840]  And I'm like, oh yeah, it's at night and they're like, I'm not going to go.
[04:11.840 --> 04:12.840]  That's cool.
[04:12.840 --> 04:13.840]  I know.
[04:14.440 --> 04:15.440]  It is.
[04:15.440 --> 04:21.320]  I, you know, we do attempt to bribe folks to arrive early with snacks.
[04:21.320 --> 04:22.960]  But I didn't know that.
[04:22.960 --> 04:23.960]  I didn't know that.
[04:23.960 --> 04:26.720]  So maybe we need to do more advertising on the snacks.
[04:26.720 --> 04:27.720]  Well, I see.
[04:27.720 --> 04:28.720]  Commercial?
[04:28.720 --> 04:31.720]  Can we do a commercial?
[04:31.720 --> 04:35.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, please eat snacks.
[04:35.040 --> 04:39.760]  Everyone is welcome here and that's why there are delicious vegan vegetarian treats.
[04:39.760 --> 04:42.760]  Oh my goodness, that's fantastic.
[04:42.760 --> 04:51.040]  Thank you to our spokesmodel, Scotty, who organizes the Frostcon conference.
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.880]  It's basically Fosden, but it happens in Germany right outside the town of Bonn where I live.
[04:55.880 --> 04:56.880]  Please come visit us.
[04:56.880 --> 04:59.440]  It's very nice there.
[04:59.440 --> 05:04.720]  It's the small town in Germany that starts with a B, so it's very chill there.
[05:04.720 --> 05:09.560]  We don't have the cool disco tech like Berlin, but we do have a very beautiful park, so you
[05:09.560 --> 05:11.960]  should come and join us.
[05:11.960 --> 05:13.800]  We promise you long walks along the Rhine.
