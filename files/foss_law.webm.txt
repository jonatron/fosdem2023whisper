[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  All right, everybody, I'd like to introduce you to Sarah Dain Whitfield.
[00:09.000 --> 00:11.320]  Hi, everyone.
[00:11.320 --> 00:13.880]  As you know now, my name is Sarah Dain Whitfield.
[00:13.880 --> 00:17.360]  I'm an open source advisor at Google.
[00:17.360 --> 00:22.320]  This is my very first FOSDEM, very first in person speaking engagement, so please bear
[00:22.320 --> 00:23.320]  with me through the nerves.
[00:23.320 --> 00:24.320]  I'm the jetlight.
[00:24.320 --> 00:25.320]  Thank you.
[00:25.320 --> 00:30.760]  Thank you.
[00:30.760 --> 00:33.960]  Everyone I've met so far has been so nice, so gracious, so understanding.
[00:33.960 --> 00:36.920]  I really, really appreciate it.
[00:36.920 --> 00:43.240]  And I'll also say that while I'm going to nerd out quite a bit on this topic that I
[00:43.240 --> 00:49.600]  find super interesting, if you came here for answers about what exactly is the unauthorized
[00:49.600 --> 00:54.280]  practice of law, I regret to inform you that you will not be leaving with answers.
[00:54.280 --> 00:58.880]  You will be leaving with lots and lots of questions, and I hope that that will spur
[00:58.880 --> 01:05.040]  some discussion, and we can think through some of the very fuzzy lines that determine
[01:05.040 --> 01:08.640]  what is or isn't the practice of law.
[01:08.640 --> 01:10.560]  Let's see.
[01:10.560 --> 01:12.560]  Hopefully this works.
[01:12.560 --> 01:18.840]  All right, so in light of the subject matter that I'm covering today, I wanted to just
[01:18.840 --> 01:21.800]  clarify that this is not legal advice.
[01:21.800 --> 01:24.400]  I am not your employer.
[01:24.400 --> 01:28.360]  This is for general informational purposes only.
[01:28.360 --> 01:31.600]  Likewise, I have a few housekeeping notes.
[01:31.600 --> 01:39.000]  So typical American, I know, mostly going to be focusing, well, exclusively going to be
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.760]  focusing on U.S. law today, mostly because that's where most of the action is with regard
[01:45.760 --> 01:47.400]  to software at this time.
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.320]  It's also what I'm most familiar with when it comes to unauthorized practice of law.
[01:52.320 --> 01:58.240]  I absolutely acknowledge that basically every other jurisdiction around the world regulates
[01:58.240 --> 02:05.160]  the practice of law, and based on the research that I did before this talk, it appears that
[02:05.160 --> 02:11.040]  most other countries really distinguish and emphasize regulating the practice in a courtroom
[02:11.040 --> 02:16.800]  setting where you're actually representing a client in front of a judge way more than
[02:16.800 --> 02:23.680]  out of law practice, and it's less distinguished in the U.S.
[02:23.680 --> 02:30.720]  Finally, I wanted to let you all know in the interest of time, and everything that I want
[02:30.720 --> 02:37.760]  to cover, I'm going to be giving you high-level summaries of various rules and three cases
[02:37.760 --> 02:43.800]  that I'll cover, and as I mentioned before, I'm going to leave you with some open-ended
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.200]  questions to consider.
[02:48.200 --> 02:54.760]  To get started, by show of hands, is anyone familiar with a company called Do Not Pay?
[02:54.760 --> 02:58.400]  Okay, just a few of you.
[02:58.400 --> 03:04.520]  So Do Not Pay is a U.S.-based company that was launched in 2015, initially providing
[03:04.520 --> 03:12.040]  a chatbot service that would help users fight traffic tickets.
[03:12.040 --> 03:17.360]  They expanded their services to deal with other consumer disputes, like if your flight
[03:17.360 --> 03:23.920]  was canceled and you were eligible for a refund, the chatbot would help you through that process.
[03:23.920 --> 03:28.160]  If you wanted to cancel your free trial before you got charged, it would help you through
[03:28.160 --> 03:30.160]  that process.
[03:30.160 --> 03:35.040]  In 2018, they relaunched their app to integrate AI.
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.800]  I believe that they say that they're relying on IBM Watson, and they dubbed it the world's
[03:41.800 --> 03:49.520]  first robot lawyer, and they included various legal actions and legal document generation
[03:49.520 --> 03:51.960]  as part of their services.
[03:51.960 --> 04:00.000]  So if any of you are maybe in the future interested in getting involved more in the legal tech
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.440]  Twitter space, you'll see things pop up like this all the time.
[04:04.440 --> 04:09.560]  So in the past month, that's happened after I had submitted this talk, so this worked
[04:09.560 --> 04:17.760]  out well for me, Do Not Pay announced in early January that their AI was going to actually
[04:17.760 --> 04:27.280]  represent someone live in court, in traffic court, to dispute a $200 traffic ticket.
[04:27.280 --> 04:34.360]  A few days later, they offered a million dollars to anyone who is willing to leverage
[04:34.360 --> 04:40.760]  their AI exclusively in arguing case in front of the Supreme Court.
[04:40.760 --> 04:45.760]  About a week later, it announced some additional legal products that it was releasing, where
[04:45.760 --> 04:55.800]  it would summarize terms of service and lease agreement terms highlighting the terms that
[04:55.800 --> 05:01.080]  were not standard, so that the consumer had a better understanding and more insight into
[05:01.080 --> 05:08.160]  what they were agreeing to, and whether it was standard or not market, if they were being
[05:08.160 --> 05:11.080]  taken advantage of.
[05:11.080 --> 05:21.520]  And they then confirmed that their case in the traffic court was actually supposed to
[05:21.520 --> 05:23.960]  take place on February 22.
[05:23.960 --> 05:26.000]  Everything was good to go.
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.400]  Three days after that announcement, they regretted to inform all of their followers that they
[05:31.400 --> 05:36.560]  were indefinitely postponing going live in any courtroom, and they were also going to
[05:36.560 --> 05:42.480]  roll back any of the legal services that their website offered.
[05:42.480 --> 05:44.520]  So what happened exactly?
[05:44.520 --> 05:46.880]  Lawyers, lawyers happened.
[05:46.880 --> 05:53.040]  Lawyers in the regulatory bodies in the US, the state bar associations said, ah, no, I
[05:53.720 --> 05:56.320]  think that's our job.
[05:56.320 --> 06:04.880]  This looks and smells a lot like the unauthorized practice of law, and along those lines, penalties
[06:04.880 --> 06:12.080]  across the board can include civil penalties, fines, it could also include jail time being
[06:12.080 --> 06:16.760]  incarcerated for the unauthorized practice of law.
[06:16.760 --> 06:23.640]  So Do Not Pay was not interested in pursuing that and waiting to see what might happen.
[06:23.640 --> 06:30.480]  And the founder said he was surprised he had underestimated how seriously lawyers in the
[06:30.480 --> 06:35.200]  US would take a $200 speeding ticket.
[06:35.200 --> 06:40.800]  So again, I said that you're likely going to leave with more questions and answers today.
[06:40.880 --> 06:47.240]  I would love to give you a clear definition for what the practice of law actually is, but
[06:47.240 --> 06:50.640]  unfortunately there's not one unifying definition.
[06:50.640 --> 06:55.840]  Each state regulates the practice of law, so each state has their own definition for
[06:55.840 --> 07:02.160]  what the practice of law is, and they very much like keeping it vague instead of enumerating
[07:02.160 --> 07:09.160]  every possible action or type of speech that may constitute the practice of law, which
[07:09.240 --> 07:14.520]  means that you kind of have to wait and see what happens in court or take a very conservative
[07:14.520 --> 07:18.720]  approach and just leave it to the lawyers.
[07:18.720 --> 07:23.800]  So along those lines, I've already mentioned that there are lots of different penalties
[07:23.800 --> 07:29.680]  that anyone may face, but I also want to emphasize that this doesn't just apply to lawyers, this
[07:29.680 --> 07:32.560]  covers non-lawyers as well.
[07:32.560 --> 07:39.560]  So if anyone is familiar with the US TV show Suits, which is what made Meghan Markle quite
[07:40.800 --> 07:47.080]  famous at least in the States, the main character is the quintessential case of the unauthorized
[07:47.080 --> 07:51.680]  practice of law. Someone that did not have a law license, didn't go to law school, and
[07:51.680 --> 07:56.560]  he pretended to be a lawyer. Surprise, surprise, he was brilliant, he does a great job, but
[07:56.560 --> 08:00.320]  there's always this looming specter that someone's going to find out and he's going to be in
[08:00.320 --> 08:03.640]  a lot of trouble for the unauthorized practice of law.
[08:03.640 --> 08:10.640]  So that's the typical case, but it also applies to lawyers. So just wanted to clarify that.
[08:11.160 --> 08:18.160]  Now, I tried to distill the common elements. I read tons of cases, tons of articles and
[08:20.960 --> 08:27.960]  law journal notes and articles about this topic, and I was able to divide the most common
[08:28.960 --> 08:36.200]  elements of unauthorized practice of law, or UPL, into these two main buckets. And they're
[08:36.200 --> 08:41.440]  going to look nearly identical, but I'll talk through some of the distinctions in a moment.
[08:41.440 --> 08:48.440]  So the first bucket deals with legal advice that's given by a person or entity that does
[08:48.960 --> 08:55.960]  not have a law license in the relevant jurisdiction. Sounds like a bunch of nonsense and legalies.
[08:56.120 --> 09:03.120]  The second bucket is legal services for compensation given by a person or entity that does not have
[09:04.360 --> 09:10.120]  a law license in the relevant jurisdiction. So the clearest delineation that anyone could
[09:10.120 --> 09:16.480]  draw just by looking at the two of these is the first two bullet points. In particular,
[09:16.480 --> 09:23.480]  the legal services tends to specify that it's for compensation, whereas legal advice does
[09:23.480 --> 09:30.480]  not. So does that mean that if I provide legal services for free that I'm not liable for
[09:33.200 --> 09:39.240]  unauthorized practice of law? Unfortunately not, because some states will then deem or
[09:39.240 --> 09:45.600]  may deem your provision of legal services as also providing legal advice. And they don't
[09:45.600 --> 09:50.680]  distinguish in most cases giving legal advice. You can give that away for free and still
[09:50.680 --> 09:57.240]  be held liable. So isn't great. There are also a bunch of other nuanced distinctions
[09:57.240 --> 10:04.240]  that hopefully you'll start to see come through as I discuss the cases. In how courts look
[10:04.240 --> 10:11.240]  at and distinguish, are we okay? Between what is legal advice and what legal services are.
[10:11.760 --> 10:18.760]  So since I can't give you a definition for the practice of law, and we couldn't really
[10:24.040 --> 10:31.040]  back into it from looking at what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law, let's talk
[10:31.040 --> 10:38.040]  about the public policy rationale for why this exists at all. This quote is from a 1952
[10:38.600 --> 10:45.600]  Missouri Supreme Court case, and despite its age I think it sums up the gist of the public
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.640]  policy rationale pretty well. At the end of the day it comes down to consumer protection.
[10:50.640 --> 10:56.480]  This theoretically is not supposed to be about protecting lawyers and their livelihoods,
[10:56.480 --> 11:02.440]  creating a monopoly over who can give legal advice and provide legal services. What is
[11:02.440 --> 11:08.680]  really supposed to do is protect the public and make sure that if they're getting advice,
[11:08.680 --> 11:14.880]  if they're relying on someone else, that it's actually reliable, that it's competent advice,
[11:14.880 --> 11:21.880]  and that maybe there's some repercussions if that doesn't hold water. So in light of
[11:24.920 --> 11:31.760]  that great public policy theory, what does that actually look like in practice? The options
[11:31.880 --> 11:38.640]  for legal representation in the US come down to, well you can do it yourself, all alone,
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.240]  do your own research, fill out your own forms, draft your own documents, file your own things,
[11:44.240 --> 11:49.880]  that's what we call pro se representation, or you can hire a lawyer which tends to be
[11:49.880 --> 11:54.520]  expensive and if you don't already have a connection through family or friends to a
[11:54.520 --> 12:01.120]  lawyer, it can be really hard to track down the right person. And additionally your claim
[12:01.160 --> 12:08.160]  may not be worth their time since they charge by the hour. And finally, in very limited
[12:08.520 --> 12:15.360]  circumstances, mostly confined to criminal cases, a court may actually appoint a lawyer
[12:15.360 --> 12:21.760]  to you, but that's not really a viable option for the vast majority of especially civil
[12:21.760 --> 12:28.760]  cases that deal with consumer protection. So how's that public policy rationale looking
[12:29.760 --> 12:36.760]  in practice? Clearly there's a bit of a disconnect. Additionally, the US is currently suffering
[12:38.080 --> 12:45.080]  from what many call a crisis in terms of access to justice, access to efficient, affordable,
[12:48.360 --> 12:55.360]  reasonable expectation of justice and the ability to interact with the justice system.
[12:56.360 --> 13:03.360]  And based on this quote and all of the other relevant demographics and statistics about
[13:03.400 --> 13:10.400]  this issue, it largely impacts low and middle income individuals who can't afford legal
[13:12.320 --> 13:19.320]  services. So to get back to the unauthorized practice of law, again, I wanted to try and
[13:19.960 --> 13:26.960]  find a way to describe the various ways that a court may consider, since we don't have
[13:29.480 --> 13:36.480]  clear definitions, what may bump over into the category, what may cross that fuzzy line
[13:36.680 --> 13:43.680]  into the unauthorized practice. And so these are various high level categories of what
[13:44.280 --> 13:50.880]  may tip the scales. But again, to clarify, there's no clear set framework that anyone
[13:50.880 --> 13:57.880]  is following. There's no set determination that, oh, well, if they disclaimed that they're
[13:58.200 --> 14:04.640]  not a lawyer and it's not legal advice like I did earlier, then it's clearly outside the
[14:04.640 --> 14:10.760]  realm and can't be held liable. There's no clear line drawn. If I am giving you legal
[14:10.800 --> 14:17.800]  advice for free, again, as I said, it very well may not be exempt from liability. So
[14:20.240 --> 14:24.800]  you'll see some of those factors come up again in these cases. In the interest of time, again,
[14:24.800 --> 14:29.840]  I want to kick start the first case. So this is Janssen versus LegalZoom. Quite some time
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.840]  ago, 2011, this was a case that took place in Missouri. And LegalZoom, for anyone who's
[14:37.840 --> 14:44.840]  not familiar, is a website that offers legal services throughout the United States. When
[14:49.120 --> 14:56.120]  they initially started, it was just their basic legal forms that someone could buy, print
[14:57.520 --> 15:03.520]  out, and fill in themselves and do whatever they wanted with. That's what the court considered
[15:03.520 --> 15:10.520]  to be the goods that LegalZoom offered. They expanded into building out a program, essentially
[15:10.520 --> 15:17.520]  as decision trees where they provided questionnaires to their customers and then would generate
[15:18.040 --> 15:24.040]  legal documents based on the user input. That's what the court, in this case, deemed the services
[15:24.040 --> 15:31.040]  that were provided for sale. Sorry, lost my place. So LegalZoom did mention that legal
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.560]  services make a lot of statements that they were not a law firm. They were not providing
[15:38.560 --> 15:45.560]  legal advice. This was meant to be self-help services. And no actual harm was cited in
[15:48.200 --> 15:55.200]  the case as being done to the public or to the actual customers of LegalZoom. Despite
[15:56.200 --> 16:02.800]  all of this, the court still found that the services constituted unauthorized practice
[16:02.880 --> 16:09.880]  of law. So in particular, I wanted to call this to your attention, the court specifically
[16:10.720 --> 16:17.720]  honed in on the fact that a human had programmed the software to generate the legal documents.
[16:21.440 --> 16:28.440]  And since the human that programmed it was not a Missouri licensed attorney, but they
[16:29.440 --> 16:35.000]  had to have relied on Missouri law in order to generate documents that would affect a
[16:35.000 --> 16:41.280]  Missouri resident, that they clearly must have been making legal determinations. Just
[16:41.280 --> 16:47.720]  like a Missouri licensed attorney would do a client intake and ask a series of questions
[16:47.720 --> 16:52.000]  of the client and then use that to inform what documents they would choose and what
[16:52.040 --> 16:58.560]  content made it into those documents. So the first open-ended question that I want you
[16:58.560 --> 17:05.560]  all to consider is this was decided just over 10 years ago now. How might the court have
[17:07.160 --> 17:14.160]  viewed this human programmer input if this were an AI model instead? And based on where
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.280]  technology has come and where the lay person understanding of what technology is capable
[17:23.280 --> 17:30.280]  of doing, how might that affect how courts look at this? So let's fast forward 10 years
[17:30.280 --> 17:37.280]  to 2021. This is a Miami based startup called TIPT. They were sued by the Florida Bar Association
[17:38.280 --> 17:45.280]  for allegedly violating the unauthorized practice of law regulations. TIPT had developed
[17:45.640 --> 17:52.640]  an app that would connect anyone who had gotten a traffic ticket with a licensed Florida attorney
[17:54.480 --> 18:01.480]  to resolve the case and they did it for an upfront flat fee based on a percentage of
[18:01.480 --> 18:07.640]  the total violation fee on the face value of that ticket. It built an algorithm, this
[18:07.640 --> 18:14.240]  is the main business model, they built an algorithm that used court data on the likelihood
[18:14.240 --> 18:21.240]  of a ticket being dismissed in court or being charged fees or accruing points in excess
[18:22.160 --> 18:27.600]  of the face value of the ticket to come up with what was actually going to be profitable,
[18:27.600 --> 18:33.240]  kind of like an insurance company will calculate the risk that you as a young healthy person
[18:33.240 --> 18:38.680]  are going to suffer some catastrophic loss and they're going to have to pay big. It's
[18:38.680 --> 18:43.520]  probably a low likelihood so they charge you at least in the United States, forgive the
[18:43.520 --> 18:49.760]  example. In the US we get charged a lot of money to pay for our health insurance and
[18:49.760 --> 18:55.760]  usually don't see a return on that unless something really bad happens and that's a
[18:55.760 --> 19:02.760]  story for another time. So to get back to the ticked case, they made it very, very clear
[19:03.680 --> 19:10.680]  in all of their website communications in their terms of service, everywhere on their
[19:12.440 --> 19:19.200]  site that they were not providing legal services, they were going to connect you with a licensed
[19:19.200 --> 19:25.760]  attorney who would take over and handle the case for you and their sole responsibility
[19:25.760 --> 19:32.120]  would be determining whether or not your case was a good fit, referring to a licensed attorney
[19:32.120 --> 19:36.080]  and then negotiating that flat fee on your behalf with the attorney and they would take
[19:36.080 --> 19:41.920]  care of all the payments. Once the connection was made between the customer and the attorney,
[19:41.920 --> 19:46.280]  ticked removed itself from that relationship other than providing the financing to pay
[19:46.320 --> 19:52.080]  the attorney and any related costs. Likewise, the lawyers were not employees. I'm running
[19:52.080 --> 19:59.080]  out of time. So to skip ahead, no harm was done. There were two groups that filed amicus
[20:00.400 --> 20:07.400]  briefs, one in support of the Florida Bar, one in support of ticked and surprise, surprise
[20:07.400 --> 20:11.680]  they were at odds. One was a group of private practice attorneys in competition with ticked.
[20:11.680 --> 20:18.680]  The other was a group of consumer rights activists and legal aid services. So back to that public
[20:19.720 --> 20:26.400]  policy rationale. In a 4-3 decision in the Florida Supreme Court, they found that ticked
[20:26.400 --> 20:32.320]  was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and cited a number of potential harms
[20:32.320 --> 20:39.320]  that may befall their customers, but no actual harm. But this was enough justification. The
[20:39.880 --> 20:46.880]  majority had even said that they lauded the idea that technology was lowering the barrier
[20:47.680 --> 20:54.680]  of entry to getting legal services to having public benefit and public convenience, but
[20:56.800 --> 21:03.320]  that still was not enough to knock out the unauthorized practice of law claims. The minority
[21:03.320 --> 21:07.480]  dissent, I'm not going to have time to cover it in full, but it's great if you have a chance
[21:07.520 --> 21:12.600]  to read it. I have citations in my slides. Essentially they say, hey, this is a hedge.
[21:12.600 --> 21:18.520]  This is purely financial. It has nothing to do with law. And all you're getting is certainty
[21:18.520 --> 21:23.080]  of this is the flat fee that I pay and that's all that I'm going to pay. And it has nothing
[21:23.080 --> 21:28.480]  to do with legal lawyers handle all of the legal stuff. So this should not have been
[21:28.480 --> 21:34.200]  considered unauthorized practice of law. In Ray Peterson, involved, I'm going to skip
[21:34.240 --> 21:41.240]  through this, forgive me, the non-profit called Upsolve. Upsolve provides free legal services
[21:43.480 --> 21:50.480]  to low income individuals to file for personal bankruptcy in the U.S. Again, no harm done,
[21:51.480 --> 21:58.480]  no fees charged. Upsolve was still found to be engaged in the unauthorized practice
[21:59.480 --> 22:05.520]  of law, despite plenty of disclaimers relying on government issued forms and instruction
[22:05.520 --> 22:09.840]  sheets and publicly available information, making sure that they were only serving clients
[22:09.840 --> 22:16.840]  that had very basic cases that didn't require additional legal advice or input, had a lot
[22:17.720 --> 22:24.720]  of controls in place, but unfortunately it was not enough. Fortunately, in the unlike
[22:25.200 --> 22:32.200]  ticked, Upsolve was able to work with the bankruptcy court to make changes. They're
[22:32.920 --> 22:37.920]  currently working with the bankruptcy court to make changes to their program so that they
[22:37.920 --> 22:43.080]  can continue their services, whereas ticked actually had to shut down. They are no longer
[22:43.080 --> 22:50.080]  active and able to conduct business in the state of Florida. So this is a handy chart.
[22:50.360 --> 22:55.440]  Again, forgive me for the time. We won't be able to get to everything, but I did want
[22:55.440 --> 23:00.480]  to note here in the three cases that I talked about, Upsolve is the only one that did not
[23:00.480 --> 23:06.480]  charge for their services, and yet they were still found to be in violation of unauthorized
[23:06.480 --> 23:12.840]  practice of law. In the legal Zoom case, I didn't cover this, but they were providing
[23:12.840 --> 23:19.840]  some direct filings on behalf of their customers, which in the case law is considered inquisitive.
[23:20.080 --> 23:26.040]  The court, which usually is a higher threshold, everywhere else was out of court. There was
[23:26.040 --> 23:33.040]  no interaction with judges. There was no in-person representation. Finally, I wanted to distinguish
[23:33.680 --> 23:39.360]  the decisions. All three were unauthorized practice of law. Legal Zoom is still operating
[23:39.360 --> 23:44.760]  in Missouri. They settled the class action lawsuit, and they worked out a deal with the
[23:44.760 --> 23:51.360]  state in order to change some of their services and disclaimers and get around any future
[23:51.360 --> 23:57.320]  claims of unauthorized practice of law. Same in Upsolve, at least for now, but TICT did
[23:57.320 --> 24:04.320]  have to discontinue their services. One thing that I left out is that Upsolve, I found out
[24:06.200 --> 24:12.480]  this morning, which is why it's at the very end, Upsolve has released publicly some of
[24:12.520 --> 24:19.360]  their software on their GitHub org. I don't know. It wasn't cited in the case. It is free
[24:19.360 --> 24:24.440]  and available under open source licenses. I don't know if this was the software that
[24:24.440 --> 24:31.440]  was involved or at issue in the case. It wasn't specified, but interesting to note that open
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.120]  source software is involved. The reason that I'm bringing this up at the very end, I know
[24:37.120 --> 24:42.720]  I'm at time, is these are some additional open questions. In light of the various facts
[24:42.720 --> 24:48.160]  and elements that a court will consider in terms of what is the unauthorized practice
[24:48.160 --> 24:55.160]  of law, where at FOSDEM, I wanted to address what effects this may have on FOSD projects.
[24:56.160 --> 25:03.160]  Everyone knows I'm not a lawyer, but I'm going to give you my opinion about something. Licenses
[25:03.280 --> 25:10.120]  contain warranties and disclaimers, et cetera. I don't have time to cover all of this. Forgive
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.720]  me again. You've been a great audience. I really appreciate your patience with me. Please
[25:15.720 --> 25:20.720]  check out the slides that are already uploaded. This is CC by Ford.
