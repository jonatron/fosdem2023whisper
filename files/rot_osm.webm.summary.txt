In this talk, the speaker introduces the OpenRail Data (OSRD) project and its four main features, and goes into the need for high quality open data to support the project. He then compares four European level open data sources and assesses their quality, as well as their compatibility with OpenStreetMap data. The conclusion of the study is that OpenStreetMap is the best source for OSRD needs, as well as many other projects, and should be improved upon so it can be more comprehensive.
