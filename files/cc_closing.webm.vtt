00:00.000 --> 00:14.120
Thank you all for being here. We're not going to keep it long. Maybe just a couple of words

00:14.120 --> 00:18.520
to wrap up. This was the fourth edition and we are very happy that it was again physically,

00:18.520 --> 00:26.580
it's a hugely different experience. I think we are doing very well as an open source community

00:26.580 --> 00:31.120
on Toast Execution. I think we are doing well and that's, I think, something to celebrate

00:31.120 --> 00:36.880
together. There's only two things you can do with Toast Computing. One is to restrict the user,

00:36.880 --> 00:41.360
things like digital restrictions management, DRM. And the other, I think, and that's the future,

00:41.360 --> 00:47.240
is how can we secure user data. And to do that, I think, the only way forward is open source

00:47.240 --> 00:53.560
and free software. So let's keep the pace up together as a community and hopefully we get

00:53.560 --> 00:58.200
there again here in Brussels next year. And I think Fritz also wants to say something.

00:58.200 --> 01:04.080
Yeah, I just want to wrap up and saying thank you to everyone to join. Thank you for the

01:04.080 --> 01:10.400
nice questions. I think it was nice in the last years. Please send us feedback, send us words

01:10.400 --> 01:15.760
about what you think about also the online part of it because we're not sure if we want to keep

01:15.760 --> 01:20.560
this hybrid version of it for the next year. So please send us any sorts of whether you think

01:20.560 --> 01:24.760
the online part was actually worthwhile. I think this part will always be live streamed by FOSDEM,

01:24.760 --> 01:28.920
but we're not sure whether we actually keep it in hybrid. So please send us any sorts you have,

01:28.920 --> 01:34.320
and please also reach out to us if you want changes made for next years. We really want to

01:34.320 --> 01:39.800
make this more of a community event and maybe also get a full day next year. So thank you a lot

01:39.800 --> 01:52.760
to everyone and have a great evening. Thank you for being here.
