In this talk, Christophe de Dinosha discusses his project DB48X, which aims to resurrect the Reverse Polish Lisp (RPL) calculator on a modern open-source platform. He gives a demo of DB48X running on a simulator and on real hardware. He also provides a brief history of RPL and pocket calculators, talks about free software on modern calculators, and explains the minimalist aspects of calculators today. He outlines the features of DB48X, including its compact C++ object model with garbage collection. Christophe also discusses the limitations of existing calculators and future plans for DB48X. The talk concludes with a Q&A session.
