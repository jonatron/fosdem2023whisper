In this talk, the speaker discusses the challenges faced by CI systems, particularly the use of YAML, debugging difficulties, and inconsistencies between local and CI environments. They introduce Dagger as a solution, a portable and programmable CI system that allows you to write pipelines in various languages. Dagger leverages containers, allowing you to build pipelines using code and providing caching capabilities. The talk includes a demonstration of how to use Dagger's SDK in Go to build pipelines and run tests. The speaker also mentions a higher-level library called GoLink, which simplifies the interface for developers. The talk concludes with information about Dagger's documentation and a Q&A session.
