The talk was given by Pavel Pisa from Czech Technical University at the FOSDEM conference in 2023. Pavel discussed the importance of teaching undergraduate students the basics of computer architecture and the need for efficient software that can exploit hardware capabilities. He introduced a graphical simulator called Qt RISC-V that they have developed for this purpose. The simulator is licensed under GPL-3 and runs on Qt-5 and 6. It has been used by several universities and supports features like memory caching, interrupt support, and system calls. Pavel also mentioned future plans for the simulator, such as adding support for compressed instruction sets, visualization of pipeline utilization, and stepping back in the simulation.
