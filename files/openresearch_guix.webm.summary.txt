The talk at FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about Geeks, a tool that aims to enable reproducible research in the context of open science. The speaker discussed the replication and reproducibility crisis in research and the need for an auditable computational environment. Geeks was presented as a solution that combines the functionality of package managers, environment managers, and containerization tools to provide a transparent and reproducible computational environment. The speaker highlighted the importance of version control and the ability to share computational environments to ensure replicability and collaboration. They also mentioned the use of Software Heritage, an archive for preserving software source code, to ensure the availability of source code even if a repository is closed. Overall, the talk emphasized the importance of transparency and reproducibility in scientific research and how Geeks can help achieve these goals.
