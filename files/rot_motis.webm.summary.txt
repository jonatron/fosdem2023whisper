The speaker introduces MOTIS, a modular mobility platform that offers door-to-door routing for different means of transportation, including walking, trains, buses, flights, ride-sharing, and more. MOTIS uses multi-criteria optimization to offer optimal solutions for different criteria such as travel time, number of transfers, and sustainability. The platform became open-source in 2020 and has gained the interest of other companies for use in production. MOTIS is developed mainly by researchers at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany and has a focus on algorithms and back-end functionality. The speaker also discussed the platform's roadmap, including making accessible door-to-door routing possible and integration with different routing algorithms.
