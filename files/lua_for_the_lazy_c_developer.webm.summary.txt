In this talk, Frank van Bever discussed how lazy C developers can benefit from using the Lua programming language. He highlighted the advantages of using Lua such as the language being dynamically typed, garbage collected and a C library, making it easier to perform tedious tasks, prototype quickly and extend applications with plugins. He also provided example code of how to use Lua in C applications, enabling it to become a part of a programmerâ€™s modules and allowing code to be shared between C and Lua applications.
