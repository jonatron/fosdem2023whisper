In this talk, Thanos talks about Tornado VM, an open source plug-in to existing OpenJDK distributions, which enables hardware acceleration in an easy and lightweight way. Tornado VM provides a Java API and JIT compiler that can automatically translate Java bytecodes to run on CPUs, multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. It also features dynamic reconfiguration and kernel API for more advanced users. Finally, the project is experimenting with elegant, a software stack that unifies development for big data and IoT deployment.
