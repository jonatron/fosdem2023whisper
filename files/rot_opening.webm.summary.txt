The talk is about the Open Rail Foundation, a space for railway companies and organizations to collaborate via open source and work on open source projects. The speakers are from different railway companies, and they want to spread open source in the railway and transport sectors. They believe that sustainable transport is one of the underlying motivations for many of them, and they want to build bridges with other people and connect their bubbles. They also have a great lineup of speakers and presentations for the event.
