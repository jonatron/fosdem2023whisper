The FOSBOT project is an open-source, customizable, and affordable robot designed for educators and students. The hardware is 3D printable and the robot is powered by a Raspberry Pi, but variations with Arduino or MicroBit are possible. The software offers three modes of operation, including block-based coding and Python programming. The project includes a simulated environment allowing for experimentation without the need for a physical robot. The FOSBOT has potential for use in higher education, including machine learning and computer vision projects. The FOSBOT project also includes a group of educators developing educational activities and content for teachers in Greece, and they are currently running seminars for almost 1,000 teachers around Greece.
