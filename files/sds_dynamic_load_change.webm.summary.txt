The talk discussed how to dynamically change the load distribution in a software-defined storage system, specifically in the Ceph system. The speaker explained the need for optimal cluster performance and how the current read balancer in Ceph can help achieve this. They also discussed future plans to improve load balancing on heterogeneous systems and using different types of devices. The speaker also talked about the possibility of dynamically changing the load distribution based on monitoring and performance metrics. The talk concluded with acknowledgements and a Q&A session with the audience.
