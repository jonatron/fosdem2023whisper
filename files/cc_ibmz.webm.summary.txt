The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 focused on confidential virtual machines (VMs) for S390X architecture. The speakers discussed the secure execution of VMs, the Ultravisor as the entrusted entity in the system, and the protected guest and hypervisor memory. They also covered topics such as swapping, attestation, and confidential dumping. The speakers mentioned that while confidential containers based on secure execution are being developed, they are not fully ready yet. The Q&A session addressed questions about key management, updating firmware, and exception handling.
