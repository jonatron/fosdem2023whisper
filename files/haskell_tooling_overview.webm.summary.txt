In this talk, Julien DeRos overviewed the current state of Haskell development. He covered topics such as the GHC compiler, the cabal and stack tools, Visual Studio Code with the Haskell plugin, the PGP package, Google Haskell, HDoc, QuickCheck, and testing tools. He concluded by noting that setting up a fledged Haskell environment for developing projects is easy, as long as you use VS Code with the Haskell.Haskell plugin.
