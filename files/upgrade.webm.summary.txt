The talk is about upgrading to Java 17 and the benefits of doing so. The speaker starts by asking the audience what version of Java they are currently using, noting that many are still on Java 8 even though it is 10 years old. The speaker emphasizes the importance of upgrading to newer versions in order to benefit from the latest features, security updates, and performance improvements. They provide examples and tips for upgrading, such as using tools like Dependabot or Renovate to automate the process of updating dependencies. The speaker also discusses some of the changes and removals in different versions of Java, such as the removal of Java EE and Corba modules in Java 11. They mention potential issues with upgrading, such as the need to update code that uses internal Java logic, but provide solutions for resolving these issues, such as updating dependencies or using compiler arguments. The speaker concludes by encouraging attendees to take incremental steps when upgrading and reap the benefits of using newer versions of Java.
