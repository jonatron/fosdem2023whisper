The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 discussed how to build a real-time analytics dashboard using Apache Pulsar and Apache Pino, along with a Python dashboard library called Streamlit. The talk highlighted the need for real-time analytics to provide insights for making quick decisions and reacting to events as they occur. The speakers also explained the architecture of Pulsar and Pino, including how data is ingested and queried. They then demonstrated a demo of consuming streaming data from Wikipedia using Pulsar and processing it with Pino. The speakers concluded by emphasizing the scalability and speed of these tools and provided resources for further learning.
