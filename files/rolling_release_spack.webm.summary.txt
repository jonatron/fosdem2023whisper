The speaker, Todd Gamlin, from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, discussed the complexity of the HPC ecosystem and the need for a package manager that can support software distribution in such an environment. He introduced SPAC, a package manager that enables software distribution for HPC by using parameterized Python recipes to build packages on different architectures. The speaker highlighted the flexibility of SPAC, allowing users to install packages in different ways, with different compilers, flags, and dependencies. He also mentioned the challenges of managing a source-based distribution and the efforts made to reduce downstream work. The speaker explained the CI architecture used by SPAC, which includes distributed build environments, infrastructure in AWS, Kubernetes clusters, and high availability GitLab instances. He emphasized the importance of trust in the binaries generated by SPAC and described the process of approving and signing the binaries to ensure their trustworthiness. The speaker also discussed some challenges in the SPAC ecosystem, such as scalability issues, consistency, and the need for improved testing practices. Overall, the talk focused on the features and goals of SPAC as a package manager for HPC and its ongoing efforts to support software distribution in a sustainable and efficient manner.
