This talk proposed a new concept called "staging" to address the common practice of associating each artifact of a build system with a file on the file system. Staging would give build systems more freedom in terms of where each artifact should be created, allowing for in-place patching and more simplified descriptions. The concept is already implemented in "Just Build", an open source build system developed by five developers. It uses a JSON syntax as its build description, as well as content addressable storage to identify the source code needed for the staging.
