The speaker discusses the challenges of deploying network functions, specifically wire guard head-ends, in a Kubernetes environment. While Kubernetes provides scalability and uniformity of deployment for applications, the network needs of CNFs are different, where encapsulation is not enough. The speaker presents a solution where Calico is used as a CNI, with Calico VPP providing data plane processing. The speaker details how multiple networks can be created for CNFs, with the ability to differentiate between encrypted and clear text traffic. The presentation also covers the use of memory interfaces to bypass the network stack and pass packets directly from VPP to the application for improved performance. The solution includes integration with multiple components to provide support for multiple data planes and VXLAN encapsulation. The speaker highlights the collaboration effort of Cisco, Intel, and others and details the work is open source on GitHub.
