The talk was given by Kiran, who works at ARM in the Fortran compiler team. The talk focused on providing an update on the progress of the Flying compiler, a new Fortran frontend developed from scratch. The compiler uses a traditional compiler flow and is based on LLVM. It generates LLVM IR using a high-level intermediate representation called Fortran IR or FIR. The talk discussed the history and development efforts of the Flying compiler, as well as its current status and performance compared to other compilers. It also highlighted some major development efforts, such as the introduction of a new dialect called High-Level FIR (HLFIR), handling of polymorphic types, alias analysis, and code generation for assume shape array arguments. The talk also mentioned ongoing work on OpenMP support and improvements to the compiler's driver. The audience was encouraged to contribute to the project, and the talk concluded with a question and answer session.
