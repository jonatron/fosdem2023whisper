In this talk given at the FOSDEM conference in 2023, the speakers discuss scalable graph algorithms in Rust. They work for a company called Neo4j and they provide graph and machine learning algorithms for their customers. They started a project to implement parallel graph algorithms in Rust and compared their performance to the Java implementations. They built a graph builder API for constructing directed and undirected graphs and also created a Python API called GraphMate using Python bindings over the Rust implementations. They demonstrated how to load and run algorithms on a graph using GraphMate and showed that the Rust implementations were faster and less memory-intensive than the Java implementations. They also mentioned their plans for future expansion of their project.
