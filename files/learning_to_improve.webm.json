{"text": " Now, I'd like to welcome our next speaker, Bradley Kuhn. I was going to bring up my COVID test to show you I tested negative this morning, so I'm going to take my mask off for speaking, but now I don't want to get close, you know, until I mask off to go get the test to show you, but I'll show it at the end. So I apologize for any typos on the slides. I practice just-in-time talk preparation, which is why I was in the back when people kept coming to ask me questions. I was weirdly sending them away saying I was still working the last three slides five minutes ago. So I apologize for typos, which I always have them. So I decided to announce at this FOSDOM that I'm officially old, and I think it's an appropriate order. I'll tell you, his mouth has so many buttons I can't figure it out. I'm going to have to use the space bar. It's like, this is like a super power mouse I've never seen such a thing. It's very impressive, but I think it requires a tutorial I haven't had. So this is my 12th FOSDOM, and the reason it's only my 12th FOSDOM is because once upon a time, I was under a travel policy where you could only speak, you could only be funded to travel if you were speaking, and I could never get a talk accepted in the main track. And I'm very embarrassed to say this, but in the early 2000s, I didn't realize dev rooms had talks. I thought they were like hack sessions. So I never tried to submit a talk to a dev room until Tom proposed that we run our own dev room, which is, of course, this one. That's why that was my first FOSDOM instead of way back when. But I was counting this morning, and I've been to, I stopped counting at 100 when I found it was definitely 100 different events or conferences related to free and open-source software that I've been to. And I've also given a lot of talks at places like universities that weren't conferences, and I stopped counting this morning when I got to at least 150 public talks that I've given about FOSDOM. And I've considered myself a FOSD activist probably since the mid-1990s, and I started being paid for it around 1997 or so. So I have about 25 years of being a FOSD activist, and this year, I'm turning 3-2 in hex. And so depending on which counting system you use, I'm both over 30 and over 50 in the two different systems, so I'm part of the old generation now. And I want to be really clear, we were talking about this this morning at breakfast, it's extremely important, I think, for the older generation to begin to see the power. I am not terribly comfortable with gerotocracy. I don't mean to be agist about it, but I will promise you that I'm going to begin a process of, for the extent to which I have any privilege and power in FOSDOM, I'm going to work over the next 20 years to completely see that power by the end of those 20 years. But it leaves me, when I start thinking like this, trying to figure out all the things and all the decisions and various other choices we made that were wrong over the last 25 years or so. And it's very harrowing and frustrating to think about, but I figured I should put it into a talk. I've always like actually first heard that this quote is often misattributed to various other 60s activists, and I first heard it in all places, the movie The Planet of the Apes, where the young Ape says to the Charlton Heston character that he doesn't trust all the old leaders of the Ape community, and he says, yeah, I don't trust anyone over 30, which was of course this watchword of 1960s activism. And I think, so I went looking for the real source of the quote, which this is. And what he's trying to say basically is that people who are empowered, no matter what kind of politics they had, there was a lot of manipulation going on from this older generation to kind of push both leftist activists and conservative people in the directions just to follow in the footsteps of the older generation and the older way of thinking. This is of course how the movement, at least in the United States in the 1960s gets dubbed the new left, that they're trying to create this new thing. And of course now they're the old left, because Jack Weinberg's in his 80s and all these other activists from that era are older, and now here I am becoming that old generation. So, but I still think about what is so funny about peace, love, and understanding, or even communism, like why was I, I think a lot about, we were terrified in the early free software movement of being called communists. Everybody was saying that GPL was a communist license, and we worked really hard to say that it wasn't, and that it was really a capitalist license, and it was all about capitalism and great, and all this sort of stuff, but frankly I never really dabbled in communism. I dabbled in anarchy as a teenager. I was a punk rock kid, and I remember getting the exploited first album, I got it in the, it was recorded in 1981, I got it in the late 80s, and the album was titled Punks Not Dead, and I kind of think that once you're at the point, you have to say, our movement's not dead, maybe in trouble. You have to write a song that says, no, we're totally not dead yet, we're totally still a movement. Now I found this image, and the best part about this image is that, so I'm sure this is a copyright infringement, because I found it on literally Adobe.com's clip art website, and that was just such a symbol of co-option that to get an anarchist logo that says, Punks Not Dead, the first one I found was in Adobe's clip art, so I kind of proudly infringing Adobe's copyright here, because that's what an anarchist would do, right? So being a kid in the 1980s in the United States, this was when I became anti-RAAA and anti-MPAA, like this, we were already about that, because there was all this effort to stop people from sharing music, and the punk movement was really up in all of them about this, this idea that music and culture should be for everyone, and not pushed down on us by corporate America. I was a huge fan of the Dead Kennedys, and I actually, I don't have it anymore, by the way, because my mother read Tipper Gore's book and came into my room when I was at school, and took all my punk records and threw them away, and replaced them with Phil Collins, and I didn't realize until like 30 years later, because I never actually read Tipper's book myself, her book actually literally suggested that's what you should do, go into your kids' room, take their Dead Kennedys records, and replace them with Phil Collins. I was already a professional in 2002 or so, and my mother sent me a videotape concert of Phil Collins, because it moved in her mind that I actually liked Phil Collins, Tipper Gore said that I would, but anyway, this was side two of an album that Dead Kennedys put out, spoofing that home taping thing, and I may be one of the only people who literally, because I really couldn't afford cassette tapes, I literally took their advice, and I think I put like a Bad Brains album or something on the other side of this cassette. And the thing is, somewhere also around 2002 or so, Joe Biafra, who was the lead singer of the Dead Kennedys, came and was doing speaking tours, he kind of became a spoken word artist after a while, and he came to Boston where I was living at the time, was living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States, and I went to see him, and I'd already started working doing, I was literally in the middle of huge anti-DOM work that I was doing, where the place I used to work, and so I walk up to him, I go to the meet and greet, and he's still up on crack, because he didn't start the show until it was supposed to start at 9 p.m. and he started at 11 p.m., so it's like now two in the morning when I'm standing in line for the meet and greet, and I just wanted to go to bed, I was already getting old at that point, but 2 a.m. was pretty late to stand there for a meet and greet, and I get up to Joe Biafra, you know, you always want to, when you meet somebody famous, you always want to say something about yourself that will kind of impress them, and I said, you know, I'm doing huge work right now against the MPAA and their aggressive use of copyright, and Jello looks at me, and if you've ever heard a Dick Henry song, you know the Jello whiny voice, just imagine that because I can't really imitate it, but he looks at me and says, you don't understand, I need copyright, if I don't have copyright, the ability to stop people from copying my work, I would have to tour all the time, and this image of this thing flashing in my head, and you know, I haven't listened to a thing Jello has said since then, because it was sort of like, well, you're the guy that gave me this tape in 1987, and here in 2002, you're telling me you love copyright. Yeah, never meet your heroes. So this leads me to think, was I ever really an activist? You know, would somebody meeting me have the same reaction I had to meet Jello? I always felt I was doing activism all these years, but I'm not really sure, maybe we weren't doing it correctly. I don't even know if software rights and freedom were ever really a radical cause for social change, and kind of the opposite of an anarchist these days, I'm an unwavering rule follower, and I encourage people to follow all the rules, particularly if copyright licenses, so I don't know if we were as disruptive and activist as I hoped we were going to be, I mean I hope so, but I'm not sure. I think about myself as a teenager, the one who had that cassette in 1986, I'm going to turn, cause I'm going to talk a lot anyway, I'm hitting the gain too high there, so I turned myself completely off, am I still good? What's that? Okay, how's that? Am I not echoing anymore? Okay, I think that's good. Okay, so I think about myself as a teenager, and what I would say to myself, and I saw myself right now, and this is what I would say. That's what I say to everybody in the room. I'd walk in here, be like, you're sell out, you're conformist, you look at you and you're wearing a button down shirt, are you kidding me? I look at my haircut, I think of the fact that I shaved for the first time in 30 years and be like, now you're really selling out, but that's not, teenagers are the way they are, right? They don't have a lot of nuanced ability to understand the world, so I don't think I can go back to my teenage self and figure out everything I did wrong because I was a lot stupider as a teenager and I wouldn't trust that person to make any conclusions. But what I can think about is that we tried to build a coalition of people that would support free software, and I think we did a very poor job at the coalition we assembled for a number of different reasons. I think I don't blame us too much for that mistake because I don't think it's, I think it's hard to decide when you're selling out and when you're building a coalition with some for profit company and they exist in the world and they have a lot of power, so it's pretty hard to fight them without some kind of way of interacting with them. So I don't know everywhere we cross those lines, but when I think of the beginning of free software, I think one of the seeds of the problems we had was the rather single-minded obsession with libertarian politics and Ayn Rand style thinking in the early free software movement. There was this idea that we were going to let all the smartest people rise to the top, that free software was better because the smartest people worked on it and were able to work with the smartest people. I often think there was a free software developer who's not a free software developer anymore named Ben Collins-Sussman, and when he went to work for Google, he wrote this blog post years ago and said, I don't need free software anymore, he said, because I now get to work with the best engineers in the world because they're all at Google. So my goal in being in free software from his perspective was to be able to cross-collaborate many different organizations with the best minds, but from his perspective, once he got into the company that had the best minds, he didn't need free software anymore. And that kind of philosophy, I think, was really central to early FOS and also led us to really count out a capitalism. There were two things going on. One, we were being called communists constantly. There's an article of talking about GPL enforcement in Forbes in 2002 that sort of paints me as this communist. And then there was this idea that capitalism was going to be better with free software. And we wanted to convince people. I remember giving talks, going on about you can get rich doing free software and all that sort of stuff. And my team itself would definitely call me a sellout for saying that, for sure. And we've always loved this word freedom and saying fighting for people's freedom, their rights in free software, their ability to do things. But I think we were a little too focused on the freedom of the privileged few to really capitalize on that FOS and do something with it. And I think we forgot about the hobbyists that really, I think, were the center of why free software existed in the first place. So this is a slide from exactly 10 years ago on this day. I just copied the slide forward from my talk 10 years ago. And I've thought about this quote so often over the last 10 years. I was completely obsessed with it when it happened. And this really put into perspective for me the difference between copy left and non-copy left. I don't think copy left is the goal of free software. But the interesting thing about those who wanted to use copy left as a tool and those who despised it is very stark and important. Because the interest of capitalist endeavors was to have a full range of motion and to have a full range of any type of software they could do. So this idea of, well, we want to be able to choose when we open source and choose when we don't. That's what matters most to us because it gives us maximum flexibility and therefore maximizes profit. And I think we were afraid, those of us who are more hardcore free software activists, to not simply say that non-copy lefted software is fundamentally flawed. That giving software to companies and saying we're not going to make any requirements on you that you act well in this community. You have no rules. You have, in essence, anarchy. And it's the precise reason I'm not an anarchist anymore because I've observed that anarchy tends to work great for small collaborative groups of 20 to 30 people who are all equals. But as soon as you bring power dynamics into anarchy and try to scale it, anarchy becomes capitalism, unbridled capitalism, the ability for the wealthy to have more power. It's pretty akin to the same libertarian politics that I feel over influenced the early free software world. I used to say all the time in talks that the great thing about free software is that commercial and non-commercial actors could be equal. That somehow the way free software communities operated would make sure that a large commercial entity would have to answer to the individual developer. Now that does happen and it even still happens today, but I don't actually think it's the norm. I think given the amount of resources, particularly now, that are put forward by commercial entities into open source, means that there is always a power imbalance between the individual developer, the individual contributor, and the corporate commercial contributor. And in fact, this is a great place where copy left has somewhat failed us, because copy left by itself is useful for this problem, but it is still insufficient in its ability to put non-commercial and commercial actors truly on equal footing, in part because enforcement is so hard to find. That's what I spent a lot of my time trying to do in my day job these days, is figure out how to actually make sure the copy left is complied with, but even if we had universal copy left compliance, I don't think it would automatically solve this power imbalance between commercial and non-commercial actors. One of the fondest things I've always liked to say is that I showed up in free software for the free isn't price, because I was a student and I looked at Solaris x86 and it was a $450 in 1994 dollars, or $93, for a student license, which was completely unaffordable for me in 1993, and I said, well, I'm going to install Linux because it's free isn't price. I wasn't really that worried yet about the license of the software, I just wanted a Unix system that was not $450 US dollars, but I stayed, of course, because I got all the source code to Linux and everything else that was on my Slackware distribution that I ran in those days, so I always say this, that I came for the free isn't price and stayed for the free isn't freedom, but I think we underestimated how important free isn't price was. I think there was this essential egalitarian component of people being able to download software as soon as they got an internet connection and not have to pay for it that was important. I'm not saying we should change the licenses to not allow commercial activity or anything like that, I think we should, of course, continue to write our licenses that way, but I think we need to consider the equity of people around the world who may not be able to afford access to software. One of the things I do a lot in GPL enforcement is constantly raise the issue that if your source code release for your GPL work is a multi gigabyte download, you have to give away to get it to people who might have to pay by the hour for internet access at 100 or 10 or 5 or 10 megabits, right, because there are people around the world who go to internet cafes just to get internet access and how would have to pay to download that source release, and if you're holding it back from them, then you're creating an equity that the copy left licenses were meant to solve. I'm obsessed with time travel. I felt a lot of bad things happen in my life, and the only way I can get to sleep any night is I start imagining that I can go back in time and solve everything that's gone wrong. So I've thought a tremendous amount if I could write Marty's letter to solve the worst thing that happened, what would I write? If I think about what I'd have to write with regard at least to the worst thing that's happened in free software, I think this is the letter I would write. I would never have imagined in 2000 that most of the software that individuals use, I'm not talking about companies, I'm not talking about business software, I'm talking about what an individual uses on their mobile device. They pay for their data plan, but they don't pay for any software. People don't like apps that even cost a dollar. They download the Free As In Price app that will put advertising in their face, and they live without advertising all day long. Now I knew advertising funded things. In the 80s, I watched television. I watched television before there were VCRs. By the way, for those who don't know, VCR was a thing we had before there were DVRs, but I predate the VCR, so I remember watching commercials. I remember the best thing you had to get through commercials was the mute button, so you could mute it when the commercial was on, so you didn't have to listen to it, but you had to see it because you had to see them show it back. Obviously advertising is a huge part of culture and how certain things got funded, but the idea that advertising would be the primary funding of software that the biggest, most powerful software companies in the world were actually, in fact, advertising companies, I would never have predicted that. On the other hand, when I think about the thought experiment of, could I go back in time and tell myself that, or write myself a letter that I could read, I can't think about what I would do differently. How could we have prevented that? I'm not really sure if the Free Software Movement could have prevented the advertising industry from taking over the software industry. What would we have done differently? I think the only thing I could think of is how we handled DRM. In 2002, it was the first time, a session was actually told me this, that the MPAA session used to work for EFF said, hey, the MPAA has started using this, DRM is inevitable, marketing, like this is going to happen. I don't think we did enough to fight DRM. We really thought that technologists would find DRM so despicable that they wouldn't help create it, that they wouldn't be part of a culture that created it. We thought we were going to beat DRM. In fact, I did a lot of work in the US in the early 2000s with this thing called the broadcast flag, which the MPAA and other rights holders associations wanted to make it so that you couldn't record over-the-air broadcast television. We had this huge win. We're like we won. There's no broadcast flag. We can have absolutely, I still to this day have 100% free software DVR that can record over-the-air, but I think I'm the last person who's still recording over-the-air. It's all in the internet now and all of it is DRM. The worst thing was that we just conceded to DRM. There was this big announcement that Firefox, that Mozilla made about Firefox, that they were going to do it happily because as Mitchell Baker, the CEO, put it, we want to serve our users and they want DRM so we're going to give it to them because that's what our users want. The only reason they were able to do that is because Firefox was under a weak copy left license that allows proprietary plugins. It's easy to pick on a wealthy CEO like Mitchell Baker, of course, but we also had the W3C which just gave in and said we're going to do a standard for DRM. We're just like oh, okay, we're going to let that happen. I'm not saying lots of people in this room probably protested, complained about blog posts, but I'm talking as a culture. We accepted it. There were not enough of a coalition of people saying we will not accept DRM. Are we really anti-DRM? Did we really say, hey, this is not okay. We're not going to go after people for copying things. It's certainly not non-commercially. We weren't always willing to say that apart because GPL was based on copyright. We don't want to be pro copyright infringement because then we're pro GPL violation, but on the other hand, kids copying music on the backs of tapes was not the biggest problem in the 80s. The NPA told us it was, but it wasn't. Kids watching things without DRM today, not the biggest problem, but we've convinced ourselves that it is and we're happy to accept all that DRM. I'm very fond of this thought experiment because I think it shows how every person can make a difference because if we universally made a difference, if every software developer tomorrow woke up and said, I'm never writing a line of proprietary software, every line of code I'm going to write is going to be copy lefted from now on and I won't take a job. I just refuse to take a job writing anything but free software. Everything would change overnight. Foss would succeed completely. This is unlikely to happen. We're not going to get universal strike among all software developers, unfortunately, because companies are willing to pay so much to get people to write proprietary software, but we have to think about how our individual actions are actually impacting us. The compromises we make about this kind of stuff are part of the problem. They are part of why we haven't succeeded in the past and they will prevent us from succeeding in the future if we just continue to make the compromises that are in front of us. I think we made a tremendous mistake aligning ourselves with companies. I gave a talk, or I got to do a main track talk a couple years ago at FOSDEM and somebody came up to me after and said, I think the biggest problem we had with free software was successful and I was like, what do you mean? And this point was a really good one, which was we were not prepared for the power imbalance on the other side as free software became popular and as such we were not equipped to do that. The idea that companies would just flagrantly violate copy left license such that 98% of the products on the market that have Linux in them are violating the GPL and it's really hard to do anything about it, somebody has to do with how quickly Linux became popular. If we had toiled in obscurity for a lot longer we might have been more prepared when we were finally adopted and maybe it's because we kind of made too much of a deal with unbridled capitalism that has been able to do so much co-option. I look at things now like inner source where companies are like, you know what we should do? We should develop all of the proprietary software using all the methodologies that free software uses and this is a thing that people are excited about, that this is a great idea. That's co-option, that's taking what we were doing better and using it against what we were trying to accomplish and I think we should be willing to call that out and say that's not what we were trying to do and we don't want to see proprietary software developed. The hobbyist culture was essential to the success of open source and free software. I think in the hobbyist culture of the 90s that created free software were kind of the seeds of its own destruction because to have a hobbyist culture particularly with technology where devices are expensive to get, just the hardware itself is expensive. You need a certain amount of personal financial stability, leisure time that people have which they, in industrialized nations and wealthy nations that they don't have in other nations. So it's very difficult to create this non-commercial hobbyist activity in a culture where people have to work all the time just to make a living and they can't seem to get ahead, they can't seem to be able to afford their own home. All these things that we now face as larger social problems that are expanding all over the world at this point. So I'm not sure how we solve that as free software activists but we at least have to acknowledge that without people having a certain amount of ability to take a breath and think I'd rather put my time towards something else, at least my free time if I have any, towards something good. I don't know how, I don't have a solution to that because I'm not that kind of activist, I'm a FOS activist but I am worried that the larger changes in society that are negative will have a particularly bad impact on the ability for free software to succeed in the next decade or so. So anyway, that's a couple of my thoughts about this. I'd be glad to take questions. This is, I'm not forgetting pretty radical talks. I actually asked my executive director Karen Sandler if it was okay if I said the words anti-capitalist a lot and she said it was okay but yeah, I'm sure some people will not agree with me and I'd be glad to take questions if I have any time left. Okay, great. I signed it. You're done? I said when I was seeing the assignments to have questions. Yeah, okay. At the end you said the larger changes you think are going to continue to have problems. What larger changes are you talking about? Well, I think that I look at a lot of things that folks who are much younger than me are saying. Even in the United States, which is a very wealthy nation, I hear 20-year-olds saying I can't figure out how to afford a house. I can't figure out how to not have to work all the time and that kind of culture where you're so, and you look at the health care system in the United States, those in the U.S. know what I'm talking about, everybody else around the world just thinks we're silly, but those kinds of problems where you don't have enough space to feel you can tell your employer, I'm not doing this because it's wrong. I think capitalism, particularly, has set up a system where it's very frightening for someone to lose their job. And you're predicting this is going to continue on this path and get worse? I don't know, because I don't do that kind of activism. I don't know. I hope it doesn't, but I think it's probably going to get somewhat worse before it gets better. That's my concern. Great talk. Really enjoyed it. In particular, I liked how you... Just talk louder because that mic needs more... I'll try to shout, maybe, my mask on. I like how you portrayed a lot of the issues around coalition building throughout your career. Getting people together, but making sure that you're actually together on the same page. When thinking about the future of free software in this continued coalition building, one thing I noticed is there seems to be a significant lack of what I would call a political line within the movement. Agreeing what is the purpose of us working together? What are the political goals of our interactions and coalition? Do you see anything... I'm just curious about your thoughts about building this understanding of what our political goals are. Maybe an example of this is the four freedoms from Richard Stallman. It's focused on user autonomy, and this is really what we're trying to do. Now when we hear about open source and free software, many times people are not talking about user autonomy, but rather this is an efficient way of working together. This is just a way I can work with, quote, unquote, smart people. I'll get off my soapbox. I think it's a good point that you're raising. I think what I'm trying to say, at least this particular moment, which I'm not saying this is definitely right, it's what I'm thinking about, is that I think the coalitions we built in the past were in some ways the wrong coalitions. Our desperation to get for profit companies to adopt open source software, and almost willing to do anything throughout the late 90s and the early 2000s to get them on board and excited, I think we made tons of compromises we shouldn't have made, and we weren't busy billing coalitions with other social justice movements, for example. I remember distinctly I was living in New York City when Occupy Wall Street was going on, and I was going into the office of the place I was working at the time and worrying about what companies were going to do what and how we were going to basically help them do open source, and I'm like, maybe I should be down there talking to the people who work at Occupy Wall Street about free software instead. And so I think that the coalitions we need to build are other people who are trying to do the kinds of things that the individual focus of free software was trying to do, people who are saying we need more egalitarian things. We should be working with people who are trying to unionize. I mean, I give a hard time to Amazon employees because the Amazon employees who are all at this conference are being well paid to do software stuff, but every time I talk to them I say, you know your company's union busting all over the US, people just want to unionize. Like, I think we should be building coalitions with the people who want to unionize against Amazon, not trying to convince Amazon to write more free software. Thank you. So I noticed that as part of this you very much talk about developers and hobbyists and those kind of sit between, or maybe not between, but you have corporations on one side and on the other side we have users. And you give the example of Firefox where we gave in and accepted DRM. I'd posit that without Firefox using DRM it might have a tenth of users it has now, and it's already a small player because users wanted DRM. So really what I was wondering about is your reflections on how much we should be doing more or less with users that don't care about code and maybe how we convince them to care about the movements, or if that's just a dead end and we should focus on trying to find solidarity within the development community. I'm not sure. I think both issues are important and I'm not sure what we should spend most of our attention on. I think we probably have to try from both directions and different people with different skills in the free software movement should take the path that works best for them. If you're better at convincing users to adopt free software, getting your family to install a free software system instead of their Windows and Macs machines, if that's the kind of thing you're good at that's where you should be focused on. I'm not very good at that. I'm much more comfortable talking to developers myself. One of the reasons that, and this is possibly post-doc self-justification because it's easier for me to talk to developers than non-developers, but I kind of feel like it's back to that thought experiment. If I can convince more developers to not write proprietary software there will be less proprietary software for all these users to get stuck in out there in the world. We have to understand as developers, we have a lot of power to make these decisions for users. The biggest decision you make is whether your software that you write is going to be proprietary or free software and if it's proprietary software, you're just out of the gate being bad to users. That's not saying that there's not lots of, I've used a lot of free software that's not very good. I know that sometimes free software is bad to users too, but it's not bad to users out of the gate in the way that proprietary is. That's why I tend to focus on developers, but I agree that we have to build much broader coalitions which includes meaning talking to people who are developers. Those in the room, if you're good at it, please do it. I'm just not very good at it. I've spent the last 10 years or so essentially trying to do the sorts of things you're advocating people should do. When I've been working in organizations that were developing pieces of software, I've been the one advocating for using copy left licenses, not non-copy left free licenses and not proprietary. Outside of that, in activism, I've tried to encourage groups to use free software instead of proprietary tools. In both of these contexts, I've tried to encourage groups to use free software. I've been kind of othered by these groups. I've been seen as an obstacle in those organizations and in some cases pushed out because I'm not willing to release my code under proprietary and non-copy left licenses. I've been unable to participate in social justice groups because they want me to use WhatsApp. What more can I do? I think the fortunate thing is some of that's changing because I think mainly because of mass surveillance. I think most social justice groups basically understand now that there's a lot of danger in using corporate controlled software like the Google Apps, like using Google Calendar to plan your protests and all these sorts of things. People are starting to realize that's a big mistake. One of the things you have to be willing to do as an activist, and I've learned this now that I'm old, I've learned that you have to be willing to revisit things you tried in the past even though it was painful. I hear that that was painful for you to go through that and be kind of othered in that way. I've been through similar experiences, but I think you just kind of got to get up the next morning and be like, I'm going to try again. Maybe it'll all happen the same way, but of course there's generations coming up that are new. There's so many people out there that are completely new to this and will not necessarily react the same way. I'm actually very hopeful about younger people because I think the people who are in there like 18 to 20 right now, I think they have a much different attitude and it's a much more anti-corporate attitude. It kind of fits with the way I felt when I was their age. I feel like my generation, I was rare in feeling that way, but it seems to be common in that age group right now. I think there might be hope to try it again even though it might be painful to make a go at it again. Well, first of all, Bradley, let me say I really enjoyed your talk, and yes, I am also over 30 hex. You mentioned in the time machine one of the things that maybe we made a mistake on was focusing on commercial adoption of FOS, but there's another issue at hand you didn't really address, and that is that our classic open source free software licenses don't read on some of the technologies that have emerged. In the early days, we had this quaint notion of a CPU and a desktop underneath our desk and a keyboard above it, and that was the machine on which we ran binaries. But fast forward, you knew about services and played an enormous part in the drafting of the AGPL license. Maybe you would have liked an LAGPL license, but what about the current state of affairs with composable network services where none of our licenses read on the use of that kind of software? Yeah, I think we have to invent around in that case. I do think the FRGPL helps in that case because if you write replacements that are FRGPL, there's still some hope there, but I think it goes more back to the advertising issue, which I don't have any solution for. It's really hard to compete with free as in price. It's one of the things that was true of free software that we got a lot of adoption because SlayerSex86 was $450 and Linux was free as in price, and I think that until we figure out how to crack that nut of, gee, people are willing to accept advertising, I think actually we should start advocating more about how dangerous that kind of advertising is and how insidious it is and how it's bad for activists, it's bad for everybody to be bombarded with advertising all the time because once that changes, it would switch us back to the old proprietary model. If people reject advertising and say, well, the only way I can reject advertising is I have to pay $50 a month for Google Calendar, they might well try a next cloud in that case. I have a comment actually about your thought experiment, so I can imagine that's your point of view coming from the US, but actually in the Balkans we have a different kind of problem, so we have people who want to work on an open source, but they can't get any funding for it, so we are talking about people who are working for, let's say, 12 to 15k a year, so asking them to quit their jobs, that's like criminal. I'm pretty sure that everyone in the world, there are opportunities for smart people that aren't writing software, and if it's really true that there is a state in the world where the only job a smart person can get if they're educated, like you would have to be to write software, is to write software, I'd love to hear more about that place because it sounds very strange to me that there isn't other choices in life that you could get as a qualified, good, intelligent person. Writing software can't be the only job available in the world. I'd be surprised, but I'd love to talk to you after if you want to tell me about what it's like in the Balkans where everybody has to write software for a living. I'm curious about your take on the government policies. You mentioned unions, maybe to make a progress, but FSFE has a fantastic campaign, public money, public code, or the restaurant tech fund in Germany to finance open source ecosystem with public money. Do you have any take on this? Well, I think it's correct. I mean, I agree with the campaign. I think it's a good campaign. One of the things that I'm really concerned about, I don't know if this has happened in Europe as much as it has happened in the U.S., but there is a lot of pressure in the United States because of corporations that the code that's funded by public funds must be under non-copyleft licenses because corporations want the government code that they can take and incorporate into proprietary products. To the extent to which public money is funding non-copylifting code, it's kind of a handout to big corporations that want to make more proprietary software. That's the only thing I'm worried about in that kind of campaign is making sure that the public money is going to code that will stay public, that will stay free software, and the only way, it's not perfect, but the best way we have to do that right now is copyleft licenses. Thanks for the talk. It was interesting. My question is also about this trend on digital sovereignty because I found your talk interesting, but very American in you. I mean, both in the history part, because in Europe, often software was made by people that were communist and were trying to build something alternative to capitalism, but also in your reference to companies. Because in Europe now, we do have a system of smaller, maybe smaller, medium open source companies that are not just motivated by making money and taking the government away. They are really motivated by building an alternative to the dominant big tech technologies. And maybe to solve what they see as the real failure of the open source movement, which is failing to avoid all the software bases to be used to build wall gardens and closed systems on the cloud, because everything is now on the cloud. So there are companies that are exploiting this just to make that. So I was wondering whether you think that all this coordinate approach between the European industry and the governments and new regulations, like digital markets, could be a solution that brings more freedom into the back of the country. Yeah. I mean, I think the EU is a much better place right now than the United States. That's definitely true. My big concern as somebody from the U.S. is the cultural imperialism that the U.S. has kind of pushed through technology. I think it's just absolutely disgusting that a couple of U.S. corporations, which are effectively thinking of themselves as software companies, have such dangerous global power. And I think it's beholden on people in the U.S. in particular to fight against that. And I find that people in my country are hard to convince to really fight against that. And it's trickling through the world, right? Because you have, I mean, I look at the EU doing these great regulations that are really advancing things. Like I love getting off a plane and seeing all the cookie pop-ups that I don't see at home. And there is regulation. It's forcing U.S. companies to comply with it. But they give you so much pushback and they have so much power to give you pushback that I just want to, you know, I want to have a revolution in my country to solve this problem, right? Because this kind of imperialism through corporate power is revolting. But I do think there's a lot more hope outside of the U.S. at this point. I was wondering if you could comment on the Cyber Resilience Act and the effects, I mean, it would have effects obviously in Europe but in the global market. And we were talking earlier about commercial versus non-commercial. And I know in the text it's also talking about these issues. So I'm wondering if you have any guidance in terms of potentially coalition building around making sure that the Cyber Resilience Act is effective and good for the community? Yeah, I'm just not an expert on the Cyber Resilience Act. So it's hard for me to answer. But I think probably folks at FCEF Europe will be good to talk to, maybe. But yeah, I wish I could say more and I would like to learn more. But I just don't have the expertise to line it up with that. But I hope people in the room who are more informed and smarter than I am would be able to do that. Maybe to quickly add to this. So like two hours ago there was a session which is also recorded from the Jason Room, the European Commission. And in general it's about liability. So we also have the Product Liability Directive in the AI Act. So three files addressing this question of liability in the term of non-commercial, putting something into market. I suggest you just watch this session from the morning again and then also you can shoot us an email and we can bring you in the discussion group on this particular question. Thanks for your talk. I think the one thing that I'm missing from here is a vision for how the whole system is going to work. So I work as a software developer on a copy left piece of software. And I also kind of have a side project that I'm trying to do kind of in my free time. And the amount of throughput that I can get on the work that I do for my day job is just, you know, in a way or magnitude more than I can do kind of in my free time. And if, and so, I don't know exactly what I'm saying, but I think there's good businesses and there's bad, good ways to do business, bad ways to do business, right? And the best way, the only sustainable way to lift someone out of poverty permanently is to give them a good job, right? And so, I mean, having a thing where basically all software is written by hobbyists doesn't really seem like a sustainable kind of a feature. So I'm wondering if there's like part of what we need is not just to say, well, what's happening now is bad, but like a vision for how it could be in the future that's better. Do you have any ideas for that? Or even, you know, things inspired, you know, from like, you know, cooperatives or things from middle ages like, you know, what is this called, guilds or things like that. Like, where there's large organizations that are not designed for profit but designed to achieve in a certain goal. So if I had a comprehensive solution, I obviously would have presented it, right? I've been around long enough that I see clearly where we went wrong, but as I was saying, even if I were to go back in time, I don't know if I would be able to make the right choices to make it better. I certainly see one key component which is what changed from the past was people now who write open source in their day job, which is just open source companies want. They're kind of gladly saying, well, I do open source in my day job and now I'm paid for it, so I don't have to volunteer for anything. And I think that has to change. I think people have to be willing to, if they are lucky enough to have a high paying job, they should be willing to volunteer on their spare time to do something to make a change. Okay.
