The speaker discusses Fidora Sahi, which is Fidora for Apple Silicon devices. The firmware on these devices is unlocked, allowing for alternative operating systems and virtualization. The speaker works on the automotive org, which requires work in an ARM environment, and the Mac Mini allows for quick iteration. The project has great upstream and downstream collaborators and focuses on upstreaming everything. The project maintains two kernels, one optimized for user experience and another with accelerated graphics and built with Rust and Clang LLVM. The speaker hopes for an official release soon and welcomes new contributors. There is potential for enterprise use, but official support from Apple would be necessary. There may be some issues with upstreaming the UBoot patches due to non-standard coding. The speaker is available to demonstrate the project on monitors across the campus.
