The talk is about low power wide area networking (LPWAN) and specifically about using the Laura protocol for long range wireless communication of digital data. The speaker introduces TinyGo, a Go compiler for small places, and demonstrates how to use it with microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi Pico to create simple programs such as blinking an LED. They then show how to use the TinyGo drivers package to enable wireless communication using the Laura protocol. The speaker also mentions the Things Network and ChirpStack, two examples of Go-based lower-end server backends. They conclude the talk by mentioning a high altitude balloon launch that will be happening the next day at FOSDEM.
