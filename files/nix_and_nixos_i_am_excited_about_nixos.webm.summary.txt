 They don't like Nix. They don't want to use Nix. I mean, I don't blame them, right. I mean, you have like an issue with the principles that cause friction, right. So like concepts like immutability and determinism. Right. So the goal of this talk is to tackle some of these points and make it so that more developers can adopt Nix. Right. So I'm assuming everybody knows, like what Nix is, right. Nix is a package manager and has been around since 2003, and it's very good in terms of automation, right. And it's focused on immutability and determinism. That's the two main features. And it's open source. Anyone can contribute. It has a very nice community. Right. So these are the points I want to touch today.
