Dmitri Beliapsky, a senior software engineer at Red Hat, gave a talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 about OpenCell in RAL and FIPS 140-3 certification. He explained what FIPS is, the certification process, and the benefits of being FIPS-compliant. He also discussed the changes made to OpenSSL 3.0, such as the provider model and the implementation of indicators, and the adjustments made to the FIPS provider to match the new FIPS 140-3 standard. Additionally, he talked about other patches in RAL that contributed to overall hardening, including the implementation of cryptopolicies and the removal of support for SHA1. There was a Q&A session at the end where Beliapsky answered questions about backwards compatibility and the use of new API.
