The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about Fedora CoreOS and how it can be used to host dedicated multiplayer servers for games like Minecraft and Valheim. The speakers explained what Fedora CoreOS is, its minimal nature and focus on container-based workflows. They also discussed its transactional file system, RPMOS tree, and its security and scalability features. They showed a demo of setting up a Minecraft server and discussed the butane configuration used to make changes to the operating system. They mentioned the availability of Fedora CoreOS on different architectures and talked about its minimal package set and release streams. They briefly mentioned the Valheim setup but did not demonstrate it. They concluded by mentioning the support for other operating system architectures and opened the floor for questions.
