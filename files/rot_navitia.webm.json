{"text": " We welcome Bertrand, he will explain us how he's in the Open Transport Committee since 10 years on what is his journey. Thanks a lot. So do you hear me? It's okay. So I'm not a technical guy so I want to talk a lot about technical stuff. So I was working first at a digital subsidiary called CanalTP, then Kizio Digital and then OV and it was a digital subsidiary of Keolis and Keolis is a subsidiary of Essencef Group. So I'm part of this great organization and we did an open source software called Navicia. I think maybe some people know who knows Navicia, okay, less than OpenTrip planner, hi Volker. So next presentation, Volker will talk about Navicia because he's using Navicia on KDE itinerary. Well, now I'm working more on open data but what is important for me is to connect the vision, the ambition of the CEO of Essencef, Jean-Pierre Ferrandou, because he wants to double the rail share in the mobility mix up to the 15 next year or 10 next year to decarbonize our trips and ensure a more sustainable and inclusive mobility. And for me, open source, open data commons are very important to do this job quickly, easier because if data, if digital resources are more open, they are more useful, usable and used. So 10 years ago, I didn't know how it worked, it began with a little hack when I was at OV CanalTP with Navicia. It was the first, well, proprietary software for 10 years and some developers decided to do an API because they were, they attended a lot of hackathons, challenges, events with open street maps also and they wanted to share what they did with other developers. And so they did this API but it was a hack because the directors of the firm don't know about that. And we saw that a lot of people used it because it was useful and it was less time for them to invent other things. And it begins like this and with some guys, with some developers and then we decided to open the software because there was the open API, there was the open data sets and now we decided to open the software because we are part of a public transport group and we are paid with public money also. So we thought that was normal to have public code and for general interest, for digital sovereignty empowerment, it was very important to do that. And so we opened the source code of Navicia and with the API too. And we did a little work, so what was the benefits about the open source project? We contribute to a book called Open Models about all these ideas that was good for us and for the community. And then we decided to build some, well, there was the software with the documentation but there was the API also and what we call the open data bar because we needed a lot of open data sets from different countries, from France, from Germany, from mostly in Europe and we did data cleansing on these data sets so that was easier for developers to reuse the data. And with this API, we did a lot of different tools. For example, so that's the repository on GitHub. And we did, for example, also a documentation with example and tips. We also, we did also a forum, a chat for developers because it was very important to connect with the community. So we did also the Navicia Playground, it's an API console also to save time for developers and then we did also mobile SDK for mobile application to simplify the work for developers. But one of my job that was very important, it was to organize different events. The first one was what we call the open routing workshop with 10 or 15 guys, a guy from OTP for example and we worked on the topics all together and then I initiated the Navicia meet-up to talk with re-users of Navicia and I decided to change the Navicia meet-up and call it open transport meet-up that was more general with more different people, more different topics, not only in Navicia because when you talk about ecosystem, it's better to have a generic word. So this word was used by Peter Colpaert in Belgium some years ago, there was a mailing list, open transport mailing list and I decided to use it also for the meet-up and I decided to organize different meet-ups in Paris first and then over French cities, even in Belgium, in London also, Brussels and London and that's very interesting because now in Germany they organize their own open transport meet-up also. So for me it's important to share all these ideas in most countries with different people so if you want to have the same initiative in Finland or other countries, don't hesitate to talk to me. So thanks a lot, if you have any questions, it was a very start. So in your experience, what has been a successful way of making private companies cooperate when providing open data? We know state-operated companies, they usually end up publishing information in the open but then you have companies like Lyft or Burt or any of the free-floating services. What is the strategy that you follow? For example, we worked with a GAFAM and they wanted to use data sets in Paris, Paris and we decided to use the open data sets that was the ODBL license. So we convinced them that the work we will do for them will be also in open data. So as everybody could reuse the same data quality than them. So for me that's very important because it means you can work with private companies, you can have bargaining power even if you are a small firm with only maybe less than 100 guys. But if you explain the things and if the benefits are important for them, they can change the mind about open data or not and so that's very important. It's difficult because sometimes these companies are most based in the US because in France most of the times there are only sales but not the guys who decide these kind of things. It's good for me this talk because I have a friend who has a very bad experience with SNCF and new bicycle so to go to the west coast of the sea in France. So because they had no the right information partly in the information of the public, like the French. So it has a bad connection information between national train information and they have only the information for the original train and how to go to another region with another plane, I speak plane, I teach in B and so on. So I think it's important also that the public information is also good for the people working there. They work on national coverage because it would be easier from this kind of problem you could have in France because you have different regions with different information systems and so sometimes it's complicated if you go from one region to another one. The information is not so easy sometimes. It's very short. What could you do in the situation where a government, one entity doesn't want to publish a book later because this is such a very common occurrence in Romania. In Romania? They are not in Europe? Yes. I think it's complicated because to comply with regulations they publish it once a year. It's very out there but it's still complied. There is a similar thing in Brussels. To comply and publish the type-tapers, the real time that is not published against the company has appeared to lose contact with its customers. No, they have a direct contact because they have the app and they say if we publish everything people won't use our app because it may be not the best. Our customers adore and they don't want that. Can you convince them? What I saw is that when technical guys are talking with technical guys it's better than when top managers are talking together. The best is when technical guys work together. Even if the top managers maybe sometimes don't know it. It's a struggle. Thank you.
