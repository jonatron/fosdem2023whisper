The talk given by Nelson Vides at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 focused on using the actor model as a load testing framework. The talk began with an analogy of a bridge that collapsed due to unexpected forces, highlighting the importance of considering all possible loads and interactions when load testing software. Nelson then discussed the concept of a framework and a model, explaining how a load testing framework is a set of tools that allows us to test the capacity and performance of software under different loads. He introduced a load testing library called AMOC, which is designed for testing XMPP-based services, using the actor model to simulate different user interactions. The library provides functionality for scenario initialization, throttling, and coordination of actors. Nelson emphasized that the library allows developers to write load testing scenarios in Erlang or Elixir, rather than using a domain-specific language. He also mentioned that the library has helped uncover bugs and bottlenecks in the MangoSim service that were previously unknown. Nelson concluded the talk by providing links to the library's repository and encouraged attendees to reach out with any questions.
