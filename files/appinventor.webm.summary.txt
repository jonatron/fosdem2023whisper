The speaker, Diego Barreiro, introduces himself as an open-source contributor to the MIT App Inventor project. He explains that MIT App Inventor is an online platform that allows anyone to build applications without needing to know programming languages like Java. The platform uses a block language similar to Scratch to create applications. Barreiro discusses how MIT App Inventor has gained popularity with over 18 million users and has been used to create approximately 85 million apps. He then proceeds to provide a tutorial on building an app called "Pickaboo," which uses artificial intelligence to classify images. The app is designed to play a sound when the app opens and display a happy face if the user is looking at the camera, and a sad face if the user is hiding from the camera. Barreiro explains the process of training the image classification model and demonstrates how to code the app using blocks in MIT App Inventor. He then demonstrates the app running on his phone and explains that the app can be exported to APK files or app bundles for distribution. In the Q&A section, Barreiro answers questions about mentoring a techno-education team and the relationship between the number of pictures used for training and the accuracy of the classifier. He also discusses the possibility of training the model to recognize specific people.
