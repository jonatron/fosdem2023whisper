The talk is about finite state machines and how to apply the pattern in programming. The speaker explains various types of finite state machines and provides examples using retro game and arcade games from the 90s. They also briefly introduce the Xstate framework and a tool called XstateViz for testing machines. There is a Q&A session at the end where the two questions asked are about handling unhandled events and how the animation is handled with regard to the state machine.
