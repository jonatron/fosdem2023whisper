 for the questions very welcome yeah thanks for the presentation and the summary:

In this talk, the presenter discussed the state of device drivers across the different BSDs. They noted that although many drivers were similar, there were differences between BSDs in terms of headers, variable types, and register values. The presenter proposed several ideas for unifying the different BSDs, such as separate files for variables and driver-specific code, abstraction layers for variable types, and unified system databases. Lastly, they called for more collaboration across BSDs through mailing lists, channels, and weekly meetings.
