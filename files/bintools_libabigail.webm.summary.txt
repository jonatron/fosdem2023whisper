The talk is about Application Binary Interface (ABI) analysis using the ABIgel tool. The speaker introduces what ABIgel is, how it works, and its recent updates and improvements. They explain that ABIgel can compare the ABI of two binaries, store the ABI of a binary, and even write more tools using the shared library. The speaker also discusses language-specific ABI support, performance issues when analyzing large libraries, and future plans for supporting other formats. They conclude by providing information on how to contact and contribute to the project.
