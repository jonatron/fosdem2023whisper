Sebastian Holtzab presented a side project he developed involving Eurorack, a modular synthesizer system, and FPGA development boards. He shared his experience creating an FPGA-based granular sampling device using Eurorack PMOD hardware, and how FPGAs are advantageous when dealing with DSP and low-latency operations. Sebastian discussed the audio codec he used and how it is typically not meant for DC accuracy, but his FPGA-based instrument achieved sub-five millivolt level, absolute DC accuracy using audio codec chips. Sebastian also created a plug-in for BCV rack, allowing for the simulation of FPGA code within a modular synthesis system. He has a repository for the project and possibly plans to manufacture revision three of the hardware.
