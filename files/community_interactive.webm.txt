[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  Before we get started, we actually have an empty chair, so anybody want to raise their
[00:13.480 --> 00:30.840]  hand to be a panelist? Contestant? Catch his name.
[00:43.480 --> 00:56.160]  Hi, I'm Shirley, and this is the first time we thought we'd try this out in the community
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.920]  dev room, because you know, everyone's sort of sitting around all day learning things,
[01:00.920 --> 01:05.840]  which is a great, great thing, but we thought we'd try to have some fun as well in engagement,
[01:05.840 --> 01:10.560]  so we'll see how it goes. A little bit weak in here, it is lunchtime, but maybe nobody
[01:10.560 --> 01:16.480]  likes to have fun, we'll see. So just a community minute, some of you might have heard of the
[01:16.480 --> 01:23.520]  game show Just A Minute, it's a British game show from the 60s, it's a radio comedy show
[01:23.520 --> 01:31.240]  with a panel of folks, and essentially you have a couple of topics that you'll throw
[01:31.240 --> 01:37.680]  at them, and our esteemed panelists will have to answer 60 seconds to answer or talk to
[01:37.680 --> 01:43.280]  the topic that they're going to be presented with. So if you have heard of Just A Minute,
[01:43.280 --> 01:47.560]  it was originally hosted by Nicholas Parsons, he hosted it for about 50-something years
[01:47.560 --> 01:52.800]  before he unfortunately passed away, and then Sue Perkins has recently taken over, you might
[01:52.800 --> 01:59.520]  recognize her from the great British bake-off. But again, rules of the game, each person
[01:59.520 --> 02:05.320]  goes, when it's their turn, they get one minute, they have to answer on the topic with no hesitation
[02:06.080 --> 02:16.080]  at all. So the three golden rules, no hesitation, no repetition, no deviation. So for example,
[02:16.080 --> 02:25.080]  if the topic provided is bananas, Don would have to talk about bananas for full 60 seconds,
[02:25.080 --> 02:33.080]  never repeating the word banana, never deviating and talking about pineapples, and not hesitating.
[02:34.040 --> 02:40.520]  If any of those three things are met, her fellow contestants hit the buzzer, and unfortunately
[02:40.520 --> 02:44.360]  this was the cheapest thing I could find that didn't have wires, so you can test your buzzers
[02:44.360 --> 02:55.360]  now. By the way, those are children's learning tools, 24 bucks on Amazon. So I should say,
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.560]  sorry George, I didn't have you in time, we're not quite sitting in order, but we have a spot
[03:01.560 --> 03:08.560]  in the middle, sort of ish, Don, Ray and George at the end. So let's get started. We'll start
[03:10.840 --> 03:17.840]  with Don. Once I see the topic, we'll start. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, so Don, your topic
[03:21.280 --> 03:28.280]  is things that make people crazy. Things that make people crazy. There are lots of things
[03:31.640 --> 03:38.640]  that make people crazy. Spiders, I want to mine, absolutely bonkers. And I think a lot
[03:39.960 --> 03:46.460]  of people, crowds, like we've got here at FOSDEM, I think those often make people, not
[03:46.460 --> 03:53.460]  the word I'm going to repeat. And there are lots of others too, I think maybe birds. You
[03:54.060 --> 04:01.060]  know, there was that movie, the birds, that I think also makes people kind of bonkers.
[04:03.900 --> 04:04.900]  Horror movies.
[04:04.900 --> 04:10.900]  Sorry, does it count as a bonkers?
[04:10.900 --> 04:15.900]  Yep, it does. Okay, all right, very good, I'm glad I'm done. So now, so the mic goes
[04:16.220 --> 04:23.220]  to George to continue the rest of the, yes, curve ball, you have the remaining time on
[04:24.340 --> 04:26.460]  the topic, things that make people crazy.
[04:26.460 --> 04:31.980]  Well, I was thinking about things that make developers crazy is when you do a lock and
[04:31.980 --> 04:38.660]  you don't do an unlock, that makes you crazy. It makes you crazy.
[04:38.660 --> 04:39.660]  You said crazy.
[04:40.420 --> 04:47.420]  Yes, you can't say more than once. If it's the topic, you can't say it more than once.
[04:55.420 --> 05:02.420]  Seven seconds remaining. I think the other thing that drive me crazy is long lines.
[05:03.420 --> 05:04.420]  Yeah.
[05:04.420 --> 05:09.420]  All right, Mike, go to the spot.
[05:09.420 --> 05:10.740]  All right.
[05:10.740 --> 05:13.260]  Your topic is beer.
[05:13.260 --> 05:19.140]  Beer. So last night I went out and had far too much of this, this liquid goodness that
[05:19.140 --> 05:24.820]  is flowing all over Brussels. And unfortunately, no one bothered to tell me how strong some
[05:24.820 --> 05:31.020]  of them were. And I may be feeling some of the repercussions of my experiences and I apologize
[05:31.100 --> 05:35.540]  in advance if this has impeded the verbosity of what I've been able to deliver to you fine
[05:35.540 --> 05:41.340]  fellows. And I want you all to know that you should not take my example as an action not
[05:41.340 --> 05:46.020]  to mirror, because I think it's important that you go out and you try all of that beer
[05:46.020 --> 05:51.020]  because you will not know what you're missing if you do not take this opportunity.
[05:51.020 --> 05:56.020]  Oh, should have done that.
[05:57.020 --> 06:03.020]  So I actually don't drink that tasty beverage. It's one of the only things that I will not
[06:03.740 --> 06:09.140]  drink. Alcohol is fine. I just, for some reason, I just can't, I can't get into it. So, so
[06:09.140 --> 06:14.260]  being here, I think is maybe kind of wasted on me. My partner, though, comes with me and
[06:14.260 --> 06:17.260]  he certainly imbibes it all.
[06:17.260 --> 06:22.260]  Oh, Ben, since you don't drink beer.
[06:22.260 --> 06:28.260]  All right, the mic goes to Ray. So just to switch things up, we're going to have the
[06:28.260 --> 06:33.260]  audience pick a topic. Anybody want to throw Ray a topic?
[06:33.260 --> 06:36.260]  Books.
[06:36.260 --> 06:43.260]  Books. I enjoy reading them. But my problem is I have a short attention span. So it takes
[06:43.260 --> 06:50.260]  me a long time to finish consuming the content.
[06:55.260 --> 06:59.260]  I wrote one of these ones a long time ago and one of the things that I learned from that
[06:59.260 --> 07:04.260]  experience was that having an incredibly good editor is key to success. And if you don't
[07:04.260 --> 07:09.260]  have one of those, then you find yourself in a position where you hate everything about
[07:10.260 --> 07:16.260]  it. You don't want to look at the computer. You don't want to look at the horrible interface
[07:16.260 --> 07:23.260]  that O'Reilly has built for you to put these words into play and so much pain and suffering
[07:23.260 --> 07:27.260]  and you wake up in the morning and you think, why in the world did I ever agree to this
[07:27.260 --> 07:32.260]  and why did I sneak into the O'Reilly party in the first place? What is wrong with me?
[07:32.260 --> 07:37.260]  But I think that that should not discourage any of you from the audience from doing that.
[07:37.260 --> 07:41.260]  You should take the time to write.
[07:41.260 --> 07:48.260]  Oh, then. All right, George, your topic is DevRel.
[07:51.260 --> 07:57.260]  DevRel is a thing which I just heard about today as I was looking at what a developer
[07:57.260 --> 08:03.260]  advocate was. But I've been in community management for a long time and I think certainly it's
[08:03.260 --> 08:09.260]  an important topic. Developers are very important and it can often be frustrating when you have
[08:09.260 --> 08:12.260]  new developers.
[08:16.260 --> 08:23.260]  I mean, it's a scam and I'm here to tell you that we need to put a stop to this before it takes out
[08:23.260 --> 08:30.260]  any more innocent people. The victims are crying in the streets. Why do we continue to perpetuate
[08:30.260 --> 08:35.260]  the idea that this is something that anyone should be trying to do in any sense?
[08:35.260 --> 08:40.260]  Because it's not, it's bad, it's harmful, and I'm not afraid to say it on video.
[08:40.260 --> 08:47.260]  I think that we need more people who are willing to speak up against this. Stop the madness right now.
[08:48.260 --> 08:51.260]  Nobody wants to fall in?
[08:54.260 --> 09:02.260]  I'm still having problems figuring out what the delineation is between DevRel and the marketing community.
[09:02.260 --> 09:05.260]  Easy point for Ray.
[09:09.260 --> 09:12.260]  All right, we're going to go back to Don.
[09:13.260 --> 09:16.260]  How to cook eggs.
[09:18.260 --> 09:28.260]  So I'm a vegan and so I don't actually cook eggs, but I have seen people cook these things.
[09:28.260 --> 09:36.260]  When our friends come over, so my partner has been friends with people who went to uni with 20-some years ago.
[09:36.260 --> 09:44.260]  They all come over on New Year's Eve and we did make eggs and sausage for the team and my partner cooked
[09:44.260 --> 09:50.260]  these things in the microwave, which I thought was maybe a little bit weird because I'd always seen people,
[09:50.260 --> 09:57.260]  you see people on TV and they put them in a pan and they cook them for a while and then halfway through they flip them over
[09:57.260 --> 10:05.260]  and then they wait a little bit longer and then they put them on a plate with some toast and some probably meat.
[10:05.260 --> 10:11.260]  I don't know because like I said, I don't actually eat these things, but I think that when you cook them you also put
[10:11.260 --> 10:16.260]  like oil or butter in the pan and I think that's part of the process.
[10:16.260 --> 10:22.260]  And then you can also serve them, oh good.
[10:27.260 --> 10:29.260]  Did she get the whole minute?
[10:29.260 --> 10:31.260]  Well done.
[10:31.260 --> 10:34.260]  I think I said the eggs twice, but nobody beat me up.
[10:34.260 --> 10:35.260]  I got away with it.
[10:35.260 --> 10:37.260]  Nobody want to follow on that.
[10:37.260 --> 10:40.260]  I was waiting for it, but after a second time.
[10:40.260 --> 10:41.260]  Alright, Spott.
[10:41.260 --> 10:44.260]  Anything about nachinis?
[10:44.260 --> 10:46.260]  You have to catch one another.
[10:46.260 --> 10:49.260]  Spott, you're up.
[10:49.260 --> 10:51.260]  The internet.
[10:51.260 --> 10:58.260]  I keep this in a box on my desk because if I didn't then what would the repercussions be?
[10:58.260 --> 11:00.260]  No one think of the children.
[11:00.260 --> 11:07.260]  I know I'm harping on this today, but I think it's important that we all factor in the youth when we look at the applications of the internet.
[11:07.260 --> 11:09.260]  I mean really, what good has it brought us?
[11:09.260 --> 11:11.260]  It did not bring us here together.
[11:11.260 --> 11:14.260]  Well, maybe it did, but it did not give us ideas.
[11:14.260 --> 11:17.260]  Well, it could have, but these things are not important.
[11:17.260 --> 11:23.260]  What is important is that there is a square feature that involves cables and blinking lights.
[11:23.260 --> 11:27.260]  And if we don't have those blinking lights, come on, I'll beat me up.
[11:27.260 --> 11:31.260]  Thank you.
[11:31.260 --> 11:33.260]  Is it a good thing or a bad thing?
[11:33.260 --> 11:35.260]  I haven't figured it out.
[11:35.260 --> 11:36.260]  It's been around.
[11:36.260 --> 11:39.260]  Everybody uses them all the time.
[11:39.260 --> 11:40.260]  Are we addicted?
[11:40.260 --> 11:46.260]  I'm not sure.
[11:46.260 --> 11:54.260]  It's basically a series of tubes that go from one place to another and they're full of data and goodness.
[11:54.260 --> 11:59.260]  And also, okay.
[11:59.260 --> 12:03.260]  Well done, George.
[12:03.260 --> 12:07.260]  All right, Ray, it's back to you.
[12:07.260 --> 12:12.260]  A technology you love.
[12:12.260 --> 12:14.260]  Technology I love.
[12:14.260 --> 12:17.260]  Wheels.
[12:17.260 --> 12:20.260]  Shoes.
[12:20.260 --> 12:23.260]  Lights.
[12:24.260 --> 12:27.260]  Cars.
[12:27.260 --> 12:29.260]  Batteries.
[12:29.260 --> 12:35.260]  I've been fascinated with, I went to an energy track yesterday and they were talking about like EVs.
[12:35.260 --> 12:41.260]  It was pretty interesting about how you can not only charge your car, but discharge them and make money.
[12:41.260 --> 12:50.260]  And it was amazed that this person only spent in the Netherlands 200 euros to charge his car for like over 10 months.
[12:50.260 --> 12:55.260]  And Netherlands is not a place that you think of that has a lot of solar energy supply.
[12:55.260 --> 12:57.260]  But I was pretty impressed with something.
[12:57.260 --> 13:01.260]  I just bought a vehicle with the battery.
[13:01.260 --> 13:03.260]  So there's something I'll have to think about.
[13:03.260 --> 13:06.260]  But he did have to do a lot of hacking with open source software.
[13:06.260 --> 13:11.260]  But I thought it was pretty amazing and commendable.
[13:11.260 --> 13:16.260]  But hopefully that kind of platform will be available for a lot of people.
[13:16.260 --> 13:19.260]  So, is that a minute?
[13:19.260 --> 13:24.260]  I think we're already getting tired.
[13:24.260 --> 13:28.260]  All right.
[13:28.260 --> 13:36.260]  George George's free software.
[13:36.260 --> 13:43.260]  Apparently there's a song about free software, which I've never heard and I'm hoping maybe someone will seem to me at some point.
[13:43.260 --> 13:53.260]  But this way of developing software is based on the idea that everybody has a right to modify the software that they're using.
[13:53.260 --> 13:56.260]  Which I've always thought was kind of a strange thing to say.
[13:56.260 --> 14:00.260]  It's a right that it's wrong somehow to withhold software from somebody.
[14:00.260 --> 14:04.260]  But I do believe that it is a better way to start making software.
[14:04.260 --> 14:08.260]  And we wouldn't be here in this conference if we didn't all believe that.
[14:08.260 --> 14:11.260]  And now I'm trying to think of something else to say.
[14:11.260 --> 14:13.260]  And I'm hoping someone will beat me off or something, maybe.
[14:13.260 --> 14:16.260]  No, but it's...
[14:16.260 --> 14:19.260]  The song, I think it goes something like this.
[14:19.260 --> 14:29.260]  I asked ChatGPT to write me a free software song.
[14:29.260 --> 14:32.260]  So without free software, I guess I wouldn't have a job.
[14:32.260 --> 14:34.260]  So obviously I'm glad.
[14:34.260 --> 14:37.260]  I got to meet a lot of cool people, made good friends.
[14:37.260 --> 14:40.260]  So, there you go.
[14:44.260 --> 14:46.260]  Back to you, Dan.
[14:46.260 --> 14:52.260]  I will not give you any other food-related topics.
[14:52.260 --> 14:56.260]  How about FOSDEM?
[14:56.260 --> 15:00.260]  I have a love-hate relationship with FOSDEM.
[15:00.260 --> 15:03.260]  I come here every year.
[15:03.260 --> 15:07.260]  On the one hand, we have the crowds,
[15:07.260 --> 15:13.260]  which is on the less of things that I like about this particular event.
[15:13.260 --> 15:18.260]  On the other hand, it's the place where everyone I know finally comes together.
[15:18.260 --> 15:21.260]  So I go to lots of different conferences.
[15:21.260 --> 15:26.260]  But this is the place where the whole community is in one place.
[15:26.260 --> 15:28.260]  And we have a community dev room.
[15:28.260 --> 15:32.260]  And Leslie always makes me delicious vegan cake for while we're here.
[15:32.260 --> 15:34.260]  And it's a lot of fun.
[15:34.260 --> 15:35.260]  I get to see people.
[15:35.260 --> 15:39.260]  There are lots of really good places to eat in Brussels.
[15:39.260 --> 15:42.260]  So I don't drink the beer as discussed earlier.
[15:42.260 --> 15:44.260]  But there are two really good Ethiopian restaurants
[15:44.260 --> 15:46.260]  and an African tapas restaurant,
[15:46.260 --> 15:50.260]  all of which are high on my list of delicious places to eat in Brussels
[15:50.260 --> 15:52.260]  while I'm here at this event.
[15:52.260 --> 15:57.260]  And I spend a lot of my time at fringe parts of the conference.
[15:57.260 --> 16:01.260]  So ChaosCon on Friday was a lot of fun.
[16:01.260 --> 16:04.260]  And I like to go out to dinner.
[16:04.260 --> 16:05.260]  Oh, good.
[16:11.260 --> 16:12.260]  Spot.
[16:13.260 --> 16:14.260]  Bob Dylan.
[16:19.260 --> 16:21.260]  No one wants me to sing.
[16:21.260 --> 16:22.260]  I promise you this.
[16:22.260 --> 16:26.260]  I can give you 150 reasons why the first reason is that
[16:26.260 --> 16:30.260]  I actually can do a really good impression and no one needs to hear it.
[16:30.260 --> 16:33.260]  But if I have more of that beer that I was talking about previously,
[16:33.260 --> 16:34.260]  it might come out.
[16:34.260 --> 16:40.260]  And I apologize in advance because it's not...
[16:43.260 --> 16:46.260]  I know a lot of people are a huge fan of the artists.
[16:46.260 --> 16:48.260]  I mean, I don't happen to be one of them,
[16:48.260 --> 16:50.260]  but obviously I have a lot of respect.
[16:50.260 --> 16:56.260]  You know, cultural icon, epic performer from what I've seen and heard,
[16:56.260 --> 16:59.260]  and a lot of followers.
[17:01.260 --> 17:04.260]  No one speaks your mind.
[17:04.260 --> 17:08.260]  No one wants to part of this.
[17:10.260 --> 17:13.260]  So fun fact, I was raised by hippies.
[17:13.260 --> 17:18.260]  So there was a fair amount of this artist playing around the home
[17:18.260 --> 17:21.260]  because they liked sort of that folksy guitar organ.
[17:25.260 --> 17:29.260]  So Don and Ray are tied points-wise.
[17:30.260 --> 17:33.260]  Well, and so spot in George.
[17:33.260 --> 17:34.260]  Tied for a laugh.
[17:34.260 --> 17:35.260]  Yes.
[17:39.260 --> 17:41.260]  Open topic, go ahead.
[17:45.260 --> 17:47.260]  Is there a free software song?
[17:47.260 --> 17:48.260]  I haven't heard it.
[17:48.260 --> 17:52.260]  I don't know if it's just made up or maybe there should be one.
[17:52.260 --> 17:56.260]  And maybe somebody should start a GitHub repo
[17:56.260 --> 17:58.260]  for free open source software song,
[17:58.260 --> 18:00.260]  and maybe somebody can compose it,
[18:00.260 --> 18:02.260]  we can contribute to it,
[18:02.260 --> 18:04.260]  make it a medley.
[18:05.260 --> 18:09.260]  And what kind of license should it be under if there is a song?
[18:09.260 --> 18:11.260]  I don't know if there's a license even for songs,
[18:11.260 --> 18:13.260]  but maybe somebody knows,
[18:13.260 --> 18:17.260]  but maybe they shouldn't even be a legal aspect.
[18:23.260 --> 18:25.260]  I don't know if we have one.
[18:25.260 --> 18:27.260]  There was that Sousa Chameleon one a while ago
[18:27.260 --> 18:30.260]  where they dressed up and there was a video and everything
[18:30.260 --> 18:34.260]  and it was based on what does the fox say, I think?
[18:34.260 --> 18:39.260]  So there is that melody floating around,
[18:39.260 --> 18:44.260]  but I also don't know of a particular musical number.
[18:46.260 --> 18:47.260]  Was that pausing?
[18:47.260 --> 18:48.260]  Okay.
[18:48.260 --> 18:49.260]  Oops.
[18:51.260 --> 18:56.260]  What kind of, what kind of would this be?
[18:56.260 --> 19:00.260]  Would it be like those communist ditties that they...
[19:04.260 --> 19:06.260]  Alright, George, since you're holding the mic anyway,
[19:06.260 --> 19:11.260]  frets like flies, French flies otherwise.
[19:19.260 --> 19:28.260]  So frets are made from potatoes and they are fried
[19:28.260 --> 19:32.260]  and I'm not sure if they were invented in France,
[19:32.260 --> 19:36.260]  but I do remember that one time I was driving,
[19:36.260 --> 19:37.260]  I'm from the US,
[19:37.260 --> 19:40.260]  I was driving across the country from Michigan to Oregon
[19:40.260 --> 19:44.260]  and I stopped at a place in the middle of Wyoming
[19:44.260 --> 19:46.260]  and looked at the menu
[19:46.260 --> 19:49.260]  and on the menu they had freedom fries.
[19:49.260 --> 19:51.260]  They said menu twice.
[19:52.260 --> 19:54.260]  We never know what the story was.
[19:56.260 --> 20:01.260]  I brought up a good point about whoever invented the food.
[20:01.260 --> 20:03.260]  I mean, I always wondered the same thing.
[20:03.260 --> 20:06.260]  Whichever civilization first invented this...
[20:08.260 --> 20:09.260]  Now I'm from the south.
[20:09.260 --> 20:14.260]  That was a good win.
[20:14.260 --> 20:17.260]  Alright, Mike goes back to Don.
[20:17.260 --> 20:20.260]  A topic is open source.
[20:22.260 --> 20:23.260]  Open source.
[20:23.260 --> 20:26.260]  I have made a career out of the stock technology
[20:26.260 --> 20:30.260]  and have been working in it for more than 20 years.
[20:30.260 --> 20:33.260]  So it's been a really, really long time.
[20:33.260 --> 20:35.260]  I really like it.
[20:35.260 --> 20:38.260]  Big companies just pay me to do this.
[20:38.260 --> 20:42.260]  So I get to hang out with really cool, fun people.
[20:42.260 --> 20:45.260]  I get to travel the world and go to conferences
[20:45.260 --> 20:49.260]  and give talks and hang out at places like this.
[20:49.260 --> 20:53.260]  And I get to work on software that anybody can see.
[20:53.260 --> 20:55.260]  It's fun.
[20:55.260 --> 20:57.260]  The people are fantastic.
[20:57.260 --> 21:00.260]  It's an amazing community.
[21:00.260 --> 21:04.260]  I get to come to this dev room every year at this event.
[21:04.260 --> 21:06.260]  I get to go to other events.
[21:07.260 --> 21:11.260]  I don't understand what the big deal about open source is.
[21:11.260 --> 21:14.260]  I mean, I went to the doctor and my doctor was very clear
[21:14.260 --> 21:17.260]  that this was not something that I should keep having
[21:17.260 --> 21:21.260]  and that I really ought to use the cream to just clear it up
[21:21.260 --> 21:23.260]  because the...
[21:27.260 --> 21:29.260]  Since you're holding the mic anyway.
[21:29.260 --> 21:31.260]  Penguins.
[21:32.260 --> 21:34.260]  A penguin bit me once
[21:34.260 --> 21:36.260]  and it made me want to go and write code.
[21:36.260 --> 21:39.260]  And I don't know why that is, but I think it might have been sick.
[21:39.260 --> 21:43.260]  And I'm not an expert in animal diseases in any real sense,
[21:43.260 --> 21:48.260]  but that doesn't seem like it makes any real logical progression.
[21:48.260 --> 21:55.260]  How would that animal infect me with the desire to be at my keyboard,
[21:55.260 --> 21:58.260]  but I really need to spend less time at the zoo.
[21:58.260 --> 22:02.260]  And if I was able to be in other places,
[22:02.260 --> 22:06.260]  maybe a museum, maybe a bookstore, possibly a restaurant,
[22:06.260 --> 22:12.260]  there would be less risk of being attacked by a feral creature.
[22:12.260 --> 22:15.260]  I find myself in these situations far too often
[22:15.260 --> 22:19.260]  and I think that my life choices are generally poor
[22:19.260 --> 22:22.260]  and I really regret so many things that I have done
[22:22.260 --> 22:24.260]  and this is becoming a confessional
[22:24.260 --> 22:28.260]  and I hope that you all can appreciate that I'm bearing my soul to you right now
[22:28.260 --> 22:34.260]  all because of a black and white thing and its tendencies.
[22:39.260 --> 22:42.260]  Alright, we're getting closer to the end.
[22:42.260 --> 22:49.260]  Dawn and Ray still tied, spot catching up with one point behind Dawn and Ray.
[22:49.260 --> 22:52.260]  So once we get to George, we'll do one last round.
[22:52.260 --> 22:54.260]  Oops, did we drop them?
[22:58.260 --> 23:01.260]  I thought you had the points of score.
[23:01.260 --> 23:06.260]  So someone challenges somebody else and they finish the time, it's one point.
[23:06.260 --> 23:11.260]  If you do the full minute like you have, you get two points.
[23:11.260 --> 23:16.260]  Alright Ray, community building.
[23:16.260 --> 23:21.260]  Community building, so I've been in this since 2014.
[23:21.260 --> 23:25.260]  When I started, I think there was a lot of discussion about
[23:25.260 --> 23:28.260]  why does this job need to even exist.
[23:28.260 --> 23:30.260]  People didn't understand what the value was
[23:30.260 --> 23:33.260]  and I think that's obviously changed.
[23:33.260 --> 23:38.260]  I don't have to justify my existence anymore like I used to
[23:38.260 --> 23:44.260]  but now the challenge is like where in the organization does it belong?
[23:44.260 --> 23:47.260]  It's like existential question.
[23:47.260 --> 23:54.260]  I think the contribution to the company and the bottom line is pretty clear
[23:54.260 --> 24:02.260]  but people don't know who my boss should be, what the metric should be.
[24:02.260 --> 24:06.260]  But like everything else, I think it's just constantly evolving
[24:06.260 --> 24:09.260]  and hopefully will continue to grow.
[24:09.260 --> 24:13.260]  It's nice to see like a dev rooms like this that are very popular
[24:13.260 --> 24:17.260]  and people want to talk about them and discuss them and debate them.
[24:17.260 --> 24:19.260]  Wow.
[24:19.260 --> 24:21.260]  Thank you.
[24:27.260 --> 24:31.260]  Alright, does anyone have a topic suggestion for George?
[24:35.260 --> 24:37.260]  Okay.
[24:37.260 --> 24:40.260]  Alright, the cloud.
[24:41.260 --> 24:47.260]  The cloud is a very fuzzy concept that was invented.
[24:47.260 --> 24:54.260]  It was first described, my understanding was in 2006 with Amazon Web Servers using Zen
[24:54.260 --> 25:00.260]  which was the first open source virtual hypervisor
[25:00.260 --> 25:04.260]  which was available for them to use and it spread from there
[25:04.260 --> 25:13.260]  and it spread from computing to data and storing data on someone else's hard drive
[25:13.260 --> 25:21.260]  instead of using someone else's computer and then to cloud documents like Google Docs
[25:21.260 --> 25:26.260]  and then everyone thought that software as a service was a great thing
[25:26.260 --> 25:32.260]  and a way to lock people in and prevented free software.
[25:32.260 --> 25:38.260]  So now you can't modify the software that you're using.
[25:48.260 --> 25:51.260]  Alright, last round.
[25:51.260 --> 25:55.260]  Don, your topic is travelling by plane.
[25:55.260 --> 25:58.260]  Oh, travelling by plane.
[25:58.260 --> 26:02.260]  This is one of my favorite things to do.
[26:02.260 --> 26:08.260]  I actually probably prefer travelling by train but sadly, so I live in the UK.
[26:08.260 --> 26:15.260]  We have lots of rail transportation but I can't get back to see my family.
[26:15.260 --> 26:22.260]  I can't get back to the US where a lot of the cool conferences are without travelling by air.
[26:22.260 --> 26:30.260]  So I fly Delta a lot which is nice because I have status and so I get extra things.
[26:30.260 --> 26:35.260]  I get to sit in the lounge and drink free champagne which is pretty cool
[26:35.260 --> 26:43.260]  and I spend a lot of my time in these little tubes where I still wear a mask
[26:43.260 --> 26:51.260]  because they are just gigantic germ factories with people breathing all over each other for 10 hours straight.
[26:51.260 --> 26:58.260]  The food is terrible but on those international ones, they give you...
[26:58.260 --> 27:02.260]  Oh, thanks.
[27:02.260 --> 27:05.260]  Okay, spot.
[27:05.260 --> 27:11.260]  Crabs.
[27:11.260 --> 27:15.260]  Well, my doctor...no, I'm not going to do that.
[27:15.260 --> 27:22.260]  Recently I was in the position of having a lot of money at my disposal
[27:22.260 --> 27:25.260]  and of course the first thing that came to my mind was crabs.
[27:25.260 --> 27:32.260]  So I went on a quest to find a vendor who would be able to take a design that I had found on the internet
[27:32.260 --> 27:35.260]  that was very popular, it was very orange and pinchy
[27:35.260 --> 27:39.260]  and I said to them, can you make a lot of these?
[27:39.260 --> 27:42.260]  And then they responded, who is this?
[27:42.260 --> 27:46.260]  And I said, it does not matter, I have money, just do it and they did.
[27:46.260 --> 27:49.260]  And a year later, these boxes started to show up in the warehouse
[27:49.260 --> 27:54.260]  and they were full of plushy goodness, the kind that makes you think,
[27:54.260 --> 27:56.260]  am I at a seafood restaurant by mistake?
[27:56.260 --> 27:59.260]  But you're not, you're in this place where there's shelves
[27:59.260 --> 28:03.260]  and inside the plastic wrap it's little eyes look at you
[28:03.260 --> 28:06.260]  and you can't help but feel abject terror
[28:06.260 --> 28:09.260]  because you know that this should not exist
[28:09.260 --> 28:14.260]  and you have done something that is against the laws of nature.
[28:14.260 --> 28:16.260]  Oh my God.
[28:19.260 --> 28:20.260]  Alright Ray.
[28:20.260 --> 28:22.260]  I'm related, I have scraps.
[28:26.260 --> 28:28.260]  Get hub.
[28:28.260 --> 28:30.260]  Get hub.
[28:30.260 --> 28:33.260]  So a lot of things to say about this.
[28:33.260 --> 28:36.260]  I've been using it for the past two years
[28:36.260 --> 28:40.260]  and before that I worked at a competing platform, GitLab.
[28:40.260 --> 28:45.260]  So it took me a long time to get used to the new interface
[28:45.260 --> 28:52.260]  and I struggled quite a bit with it, but now I guess after two years
[28:52.260 --> 28:58.260]  I can't even tell the difference between the two platforms.
[28:58.260 --> 29:04.260]  It's kind of ironic, a lot of open source software are hosted on this platform
[29:04.260 --> 29:09.260]  but the platform itself is not open source so the irony continues.
[29:09.260 --> 29:16.260]  But you know, I'm not a, I don't get religious about a lot of things
[29:16.260 --> 29:22.260]  including like whether something should be freely available with source code or not
[29:22.260 --> 29:29.260]  because I use a lot of Apple products and they're obviously not open source.
[29:30.260 --> 29:32.260]  You said that at least.
[29:38.260 --> 29:41.260]  Alright, well that kind of concludes unless you want to keep going.
[29:41.260 --> 29:45.260]  People need to like start throwing some topics at our panelists.
[29:45.260 --> 29:48.260]  If not, our winner today is Dawn.
[29:48.260 --> 29:52.260]  Followed very closely by Ray and Spot who caught up.
[29:52.260 --> 29:54.260]  Doesn't George get one more?
[29:54.260 --> 29:56.260]  Oh sorry, sorry George.
[29:56.260 --> 29:59.260]  So yep, one more.
[29:59.260 --> 30:01.260]  You're right, you're right, you're right.
[30:01.260 --> 30:02.260]  Absolutely.
[30:02.260 --> 30:04.260]  On the topic of that, how about lunch?
[30:04.260 --> 30:09.260]  Not us going to lunch, which we could, but topic is lunch.
[30:13.260 --> 30:18.260]  Yesterday for lunch at Fozdem I knew that there would be long queues
[30:18.260 --> 30:24.260]  and so I went to the grocery store and bought some food ahead of time
[30:24.260 --> 30:26.260]  and that was very lovely.
[30:26.260 --> 30:31.260]  When I became hungry I went outside and I opened my bag
[30:31.260 --> 30:36.260]  and I opened the packages and I consumed what was inside the packages
[30:36.260 --> 30:38.260]  and I didn't...
[30:40.260 --> 30:44.260]  Well where I come from there's this thing that we do when we're hungry
[30:44.260 --> 30:48.260]  and it's important that you get the deep fryer out to start with
[30:48.260 --> 30:53.260]  because if you ain't going to burn your neighborhood down you're doing it wrong
[30:53.260 --> 30:56.260]  so what you've gots to do is you've got to put the oil in
[30:56.260 --> 31:00.260]  and then you find the food and then you put the food in and then you...
[31:04.260 --> 31:14.260]  Today however I was unable to go to the establishment that sold nourishment.
[31:17.260 --> 31:18.260]  Well done George.
[31:19.260 --> 31:22.260]  Well thank you all for playing along.
[31:22.260 --> 31:24.260]  We thought we'd try something different this year.
[31:24.260 --> 31:26.260]  We'll see how if we do this again next year.
[31:26.260 --> 31:28.260]  But Dawn's still the winner.
[31:31.260 --> 31:33.260]  Tied by Spot and Ray.
[31:33.260 --> 31:37.260]  I did buy a prize for each of you, however yours isn't vegan
[31:37.260 --> 31:40.260]  so I'll have to get you something.
[31:42.260 --> 31:44.260]  Or there's more cake.
[31:45.260 --> 31:47.260]  Otherwise thank you for playing along.
[31:47.260 --> 31:49.260]  I know that we ended a bit early but maybe...
