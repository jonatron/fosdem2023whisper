In this talk, the speakers discuss the concept of hole punching, a technique for establishing direct peer-to-peer connections between devices behind firewalls and NATs. They introduce LiPi2P, a peer-to-peer networking library that provides connectivity options like encryption, authentication, and hole punching. The speakers present the results of a large measurement campaign they conducted to gather data on the effectiveness of hole punching across different networks and routing hardware. They find that the success rate of hole punching is around 70%, with some networks experiencing lower success rates. They also identify areas for improvement, such as addressing issues with clients running on VPNs and optimizing the retry strategy. Ultimately, they aim to publish their findings and make the dataset public for further analysis.
