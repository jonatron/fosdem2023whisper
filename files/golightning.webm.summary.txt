The speaker discussed a project called "Go Evil," which allows users to write one-liners in Go by simply typing their code and calling it with "Go Evil." The speaker explained how the project works under the hood and announced the release of Go Evil 1.0, which now supports Go modules. The speaker encouraged users to try it out, report bugs, and asked for questions. Other lightning talks covered topics such as debugging slow Go servers, issues with the JSON package, an open-source secure email server for self-hosted email, and a tool called ReviewPad for defining rules for pull requests. The speaker also expressed gratitude towards the speakers, volunteers, and audience for their contributions to the conference.
