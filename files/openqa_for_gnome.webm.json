{"text": " All right. Well, welcome to the next talk. I'm going to be talking about open QA testing of a pretty complex graphical desktop environment. So, I'm an operating systems developer. I've been involved in GNOME for a long time, possibly too long. And I've also been involved in Code Think for maybe 10 years off and on. We're like a consultancy firm based in Manchester. And we work a lot with the automotive industry, helping them with testing. So, that's how we got an interest in open QA. And that led on to research of trying to set it up for the NOMO-S as well. It should be, but maybe it's not. It is green, but yeah, can nobody hear me? Okay, so there's no room speakers. All right, I'll try and talk a bit louder. So GNOME is a desktop environment. How many GNOME users do we have in the room? Quite a few. KDE users. Nice. Other desktop environments. Tiling window managers, et cetera. Quite an even mix, actually. Everybody welcome. So GNOME is quite an old project, right? GNOME predates FOSDEM, Git, and predate. It's older than Greta Thunberg. It's older than some of its contributors. It's older than MySpace. And this leads to some sort of technical challenges that have built up over the years. So, the GNOME designers design a cohesive experience of everything working together. But then we release more than 200 individual modules as tar balls. And distributions get to integrate those back together to produce something that hopefully works. So, it's difficult to test those 200 modules. It's difficult to test what we release. Maybe you've heard of Conway's law, the rule that a project source code will mirror the structure of the organization that makes it. So, this is a rough diagram of how GNOME development works. Most of the work is done by module teams who focus kind of on individual modules or one or two modules. So, things are tested well in isolation. And then the release team tries to build everything and they get to the point of like, okay, everything builds. So, we'll release it. And they give this to packages who give it to users. So, the question is, which of these groups are responsible for integration testing? The maintainers are working on isolated components. The release team are very busy. And distro developers are also very busy. So, certainly when the project started, the users were responsible for integration testing. You got to use Linux for free and you got to report bugs if it broke. And we would give the works on my machine certificate. And you get a lot of crazy bugs at integration time. Like, oh, this feature doesn't work because it turns out the code isn't broken, but you pass the wrong configure flags. So, you don't get the feature that you wanted. Time has passed since then. There have been lots of development. GitLab. GitLab was a huge help for GNOME. And it means that we can now do CI quite easily. So, the situation now looks kind of like this. Module maintainers generally have unit tests. And we'll check that the module works in isolation. The release team have an integration repo that says these are the versions of the components that make up this GNOME release. So, we know what we're releasing. And distributions have started doing some downstream testing as well. At least some distributions have. There's a lot of good work going on testing that the released software is good. But there's still a gap because from landing a commit into the main branch of your module to actually having integration testing run by a distribution, there could be months. There could be months from you making that change to someone cutting a beta release and actually testing it. So, there's still a lot of time for problems to appear. So, the question we tried to answer over the last sort of 10 years within the GNOME project is what if we built our own distro just for testing? And so, we did. It was a long job, but GNOME OS exists. Lots of people worked on this over the 10 years. And it exists specifically for testing. So, some people say, can I use it? And, well, you can, but it's designed to be broken, right? So, don't use it unless you want something that breaks every day, has no security updates and doesn't support most hardware. But what it is good for is testing the up-to-date latest in development version and for seeing how new designs might work as they're being developed. And a goal was always automated regression testing, but that's kind of been the last piece of the puzzle. And that's the thing I'm showing off today is that we now have automated regression testing of GNOME OS. You can get it from here if you want, like I say, only use it for testing. And it works for manual testing, but it's quite boring, right? People don't spend their weekends going, oh, I think I'll download this image and, you know, just test and report bugs. And it's not quite suitable for pre-merge gating yet because it takes hours to build the image. So, we can't gait every merge request and say, well, the OpenQA tests have to pass because it can take hours before the new OS image is built, right? So, what we're doing at the moment is we've set up an OpenQA instance. So, OpenQA, I haven't introduced OpenQA yet. OpenQA is a test tool developed by SUSE. How many people are familiar with OpenQA, actually? We're in the testing room, so hopefully some people are. Maybe half the room. Okay. Well, I'm going to do kind of a deep dive into how it's set up for Nome and how it works. There are three components. The web interface is the thing you look at, and this is called OpenQA. The thing that actually does the work is a test driver called OS auto-inst. It's a less catchy name, and that has, it supports multiple backends, right? So, in Nome, we use the QMU backend, but you can also use backends that run on real hardware. I think some distros are doing this. Some of the code think projects use this. In Nome, we only use emulation at the moment because it's kind of the simplest option. And then, we have a library of tests. So, actually, most of the fun stuff in OpenQA lives in Open SUSE's test repo, and when we want to do more advanced stuff for the Nome test, we go in there and copy stuff out of it and use it sort of like a library in the traditional sense of something that we copy from. There are some built-in utilities as well, but a lot of the good stuff is in the Open SUSE tests. Lots of people are using it these days. SUSE, of course, having invented it. Fedora is using it. I found an article about Eurolinux, which are using it. Various car companies are using it. Maybe you were using it. Hopefully, you will do after this talk. CodeThing is also using it to test Linux kernel master branches on some ARM hardware using Lava as well. That's a whole separate talk, which I'm not going to go into, but if you're interested, find someone with this t-shirt on and they can talk about it. So, let's be adventurous, right? Here's a screenshot of OpenQA, but hopefully, the Wi-Fi is going to work and I can show you the real thing. Here's the front page of the GNOME OpenQA website. It doesn't tell you much, right? Actually, we don't use this front page. We go via GitLab. Here's the GNOME BuildMeta repo. This defines what goes into GNOME. This defines what goes into GNOME. This has a CI pipeline set up. Ah, the internet's not working. Let's see. Aha, you got me, FOSDM Wi-Fi. Let's go back to the screenshots. I did anticipate this happening. Here's some CI pipelines that I prepared earlier. These are the tests running on master. These do various things. You know, they build all the components using a build tool called build stream. The interesting one for our purposes is a job called S3Image. This builds an ISO installer and pushes it to Amazon S3, which is a good place to store these kind of five gigabyte ISO images. Then, we have another job called testS3Image. That's the fun one, right? That goes to S3, downloads the image and runs the OpenQA tests. There's a long explanation of how it works, but actually, I'm going to see if I can show you the job log. I did load one earlier. No, I can't load the job log either, so I'm going to show you the long explanation of how it works. In brief, this design of OpenQA initially was that you'd have a separate machine or a farm of machines, and the tests would run on one of those machines. That's a perfectly fine model, but it involves maintaining quite a lot of infrastructure. We're trying to do this in the easiest possible way, because we don't have a big team working on this. We kind of inverted the design, and we use the GitLab runner as the worker. The GitLab runner uses the OpenQA worker container image. It calls the OpenQA web UI and says, hi, I'm a new machine. Send me a job, and then it queues a job and adds a flag saying, oh, by the way, this can only run on the machine that I just created. The effect is then the GitLab runner becomes the OpenQA worker, runs OS auto-inst and runs the tests and communicates the results back to the OpenQA web UI. It's maybe a little unsupported, but actually is working quite nicely, and there's just a couple of caveats in the web UI from doing things that way. It means we only have one big build server, which is configured as a GitLab runner, and we don't have any other infrastructure apart from the web UI, which is fairly simple to maintain. That's why we do it that way. Now I'm going to go through what you can see in the web UI. First, I'm going to drink some water, actually. I've got a lot of talking to do today. Each test run gets an ID. I can't see the ID, but it'll be some long number. We have one long test job, which tests everything we care about. Actually, I think this one I loaded. Here's the real thing. We test all the way from taking the OS image on a bare machine, running the installer. Can I open that? No, I can't open that. You'll have to look at the tiny screenshots. Using the initial setup, this is the GNOME initial setup, we poke at the serial console a little bit once we've created a user. Once we've created a user account, we can log in over serial, and we just enable journal logging to the serial console to make things a bit easier to debug. Then the fun starts. We start poking around at the desktop, and we run each of the GNOME core apps. At the moment, we just check that it starts, and then it looks the same as it did the day before. The core of OpenQA is doing screenshot matching, and it has some tools for making that a little bit nicer than it would be if it was just pixel by pixel comparisons. The core of it is screenshot matching. We have a screenshot of each app, and we say this is how it should look, and as long as it looks the same, or within 95% the same, then the test passes. If it looks different, then the test fails. This one, I guess you can't see, but this one has failed because a pop-up has appeared over the top, which is pretty annoying. One of the things that we still need to sort out. Most of these have passed. This one has failed because the icons change size slightly. Again, the image matches maybe 95%, and the threshold is 96%, so it hasn't quite passed. In most cases, the solution to these failures is just update the screenshot, and that's quite an easy process. Let me show you how. This is a gallery of some tests viewed closer up. When you click on one of the screenshots, you get to see the before and after, or rather the golden screenshot and the real screenshot. You can drag this slider across and go, okay, this is, you know, here's the difference. These areas are the actual match zones which are defined in the screenshot. OpenQA calls these needles. A needle is like a screenshot plus some metadata, and we define zones that we want to match against, and it uses OpenCV to do the matching. That's what this percentage means. It's saying, you know, it's 99% the same. A cool thing about using OpenCV is that it can move around the screen, right? This window might have popped up in a different place, but an OpenQA would, you know, if the match was over here 20 pixels to the right, it would detect that, and the test would still pass. So that's pretty useful. And you can also lower the threshold. The manual says don't lower the threshold below 90%. I guess because maybe anything will pass at that point. I haven't played with it too much. I tend to go with between, you know, 95% and 100%. Your tests can input text. So here we're creating a user. All this is done via the QMU APIs, so it's simulating a real mouse and a real keyboard to do this. It's going really through the whole, you know, stack, the whole software stack from the kernel through the graphics drivers right into everything in user space into GNOME. So the ultimate in integration testing. Here's some more screenshots of needles. This is an exclusion. So I excluded the version number so that when we bump the version number, the tests don't fail. This is the needle editor, right? So the WebUI lets you edit these needles. They're stored in a Git repo, but not everyone wants to dig around in Git repos. So there's also a WebUI to edit them. And you can drag and drop. This is a screenshot, but the green is like let's match this area. And the brown is an exclusion because this is a process list, right? So it's going to be different every time. So we exclude that from the match. When a test fails because the screenshots changed and you want to update the screenshot, which is a really common case, you can go in here, change the screenshot, use the existing matches, and then you can commit to your changes under a new name to the needles Git repo. So it's like a two-click process. It's pretty straightforward. And here's the actual needles repo. And it's nothing too complicated. Each needle is a PNG file and some JSON metadata. And here's a really simple example of what the JSON metadata looks like. This has one match area. And it has a tag. So the important thing here is the tag. In your tests, you would say assert screenshot app, bow, bow, bow, home. And it will validate any needle that has that tag. So you build up this collection, like maybe version 40, it looks like this, and then maybe version 42, the design changes. So you make a new needle with the same tag, same tag. An open QA will now accept either of those needles. So the old design would still pass. And if your application randomly regresses to the old design, actually it wouldn't catch that case unless you've deleted the old test. Seems kind of limiting, but actually open sues have built an enormous library of tests of using this method. So I trust that it works well. I think some people have actually improved on that on one of the code thing projects, but I don't know the details. Ah, and the last thing I wanted to mention was the tests. So this is the fun part. You get to write your tests in Perl. It's like a trip back in time. But it's not super complicated. I don't know much about Perl, but I can figure out most of what's going on. This is the main entry point. So we import a couple of helpers. We set some constants. Please don't steal my password, but this is a constant that we reuse. And then we load each of these is a specific test, and it's own Perl module. So then if we go look at one of those, here's a test case and the meat of the tests is calling these functions. So assert that this needle matched with a time out and then we click on an area that's defined in the needle. So in this case, it's the next button and that area is defined in the needle. We can also, we eject the CD-ROM after the install, and then we reset the machine. So a lot of this is building up libraries of useful functions and calling them. So your tests end up being quite readable. All right, I've got a couple more things, and then I'm going to open up to questions. Things that I've learned, Open QA is very good. It's probably the best thing to do this that's open source and available. You use it, contribute to it. On the other hand, don't go crazy with it because you will, you know, go slow and try and test integration. You know, don't do unit tests in there. The main documentation doesn't list the actual API that the tests use. So look here, look for the test API docs. And also look at open source of tests, which have loads of examples of good things that you can copy from. You don't have to run the tests in CI. When you're developing tests, you can run them locally. It's a little bit of a faff. You have to work out the right container command line. But you can run the container locally with OS auto inst and you can then see the logs locally and iterate much faster than having to push your changes to CI every time. That's a great help. I've messed up the numbering slightly. I guess you can follow it. There's a couple of errors that only appear in the logs. So the web UI is great, but occasionally you see like a 0% match and you're like, but these are the same. But it turns out there was something invalid in the needle and you get a 0% match, but it's only reported in the logs. So don't lose time to that. I've lost probably hours collectively to forgetting this and then remembering it again. Also, the upstream containers are useful and they're usable, but it's a very rolling release process. So you probably want to pin a specific version and update it when you're ready to deal with the new changes. Don't just pull the latest one every time. So within GNOME, this is kind of ready. It's working, but it has a bus factor of one at the moment. So before we can declare it stable, we need more people to get involved, both maintaining the infrastructure, maintaining the tests. And these are some credits of people that have worked on this over the last 10 years. Apologies if I missed anyone, but I wanted to make it clear this is not something that I've done myself in my free time. I'm really adding the finishing touches to a huge amount of work that's taken a decade to get to this point. On the topic of OpenQA, separately to GNOME, we're quite interested in it and Code Think, we're continuing doing the OpenQA lava testing of the Linux kernel. We've written a small tool to control hardware from within OpenQA tests and we've built this USB switcher, which if you have lots of test rigs and lots of USB hardware connected to them, it's very useful. If you want to see it, then they have some real ones over there. Find these people and they can tell you about how great it is. So, that's everything from me. Please, if you want to get involved with the GNOME initiative, it's a good time. I'll help you to learn everything about OpenQA you ever wanted to know and more. You can get involved on the discourse or on Matrix and I'm going to leave it there. I think we have a few minutes for questions. Thank you. We've got one here already. Okay, the question is how many bugs has this caught and how many false positives? It's caught some real bugs. We're not testing a huge amount of stuff really at the moment. We're just testing that every app starts. That can already catch some interesting breakages because in GNOME, we use 12 different programming languages. If any of the bindings break, then one of the apps will stop working. But it's found at least two known real bugs where I reported it to the app maintainer and they said, oh, wow, yeah, that's broken. Probably 20 or 30 false positives in the sense of the test has failed, I've had to go in, update the screenshot and the test pass again. But that's quite an easy process. At the moment, I'd say it's worth the effort. We're still going to evaluate over time if it's really worth the effort. But I think it's promising that as long as we keep the test suite small and we don't have to keep updating all of the like a million screenshots every time they change the desktop background, then I think it's going to be useful. One at the back first. That's a really good idea. Yeah, so the question was testing other locales like Chinese or German. I hear Turkish is always a fun one. You put in the Turkish translation and things always break. It's not an immediate plan, but it definitely would be good to do that. Another thing is testing themes. We have a high contrast theme and a large text theme for accessibility. These often also break because they're not widely used, but they're very important. So yeah, in the distant future, we want to do that. One here. Have you thought about some process where usually when maintainers of apps do visual changes, they usually know that they're doing visual changes. Some process that they can add some comment in the CI or some process which that information can be injected into OpenQI and reduce the fast postage. Yeah, so the question is if we can get app developers to notify the tests of changes somehow. Yeah, I think the solution is to get app developers interested in actually using this. So my goal is to have the developers of these apps actually finding the test useful, maintaining their own small set of tests, and then yeah, they will know at that point, okay, I just changed this. So obviously we're going to have to update the tests. It's certainly not going to scale if it's just always me doing it. So hopefully at the GNOME conference, this year, I can get everyone excited about this. One more question over here somewhere. How is that for you? So if you find an actual bug in an app, that's only happening in the OpenQI environment. How do you give them the reproducer? How easy is it for a developer to reproduce the environment? Okay, yeah, good question. So the question is how easy is it to reproduce this environment? It's actually quite easy because it's GNOME OS. So the developer can go to os.gnome.org, they can download a VM image and run it in GNOME boxes, and so they can boot the virtual machine and it's exactly the same code, like right down to the kernel and systemd and everything. So it's an effort, they have to download this image, but they get exactly the same environment and they can reproduce exactly the bug. Most of them don't, they just install into slash user and try and reproduce it there, but it's possible to do it this way. Yeah, so from what we saw, OpenQI is focused on visual testing and comparing screenshots. Is there a way to mix that or perhaps only do the headless testing settings with the commands from the CLI or from the console? Yeah, that's a good question. So the question is if it can do more than just screenshot testing. It can. I mean, we got a serial console, so we can run arbitrary commands. I think if we were going to do that, we wouldn't write the tests in Perl in OpenQI. What we'd probably do is write the tests in Python or in C, inject them into the OS image, and then we just run the test program over the serial console and check that it outputs pass. So it's definitely possible, and I think that's how we would do it. So how are we for time? No more time. No more time? OK, well thanks everyone for watching.
