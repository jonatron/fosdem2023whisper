In this talk at the FOSDEM conference, Gaurav and Alexander discuss the use of Rook and Ceph for storage on Kubernetes. They explain that Rook provides an interface between Kubernetes and Ceph, allowing users to easily provision storage for their applications. They highlight the benefits of using Rook and Ceph on Kubernetes, such as the ability to run the storage cluster on any hardware and the simplified management through the use of operators. They also discuss the Rook Ceph plugin for kubectl, which provides additional automation and troubleshooting capabilities. They mention that Rook is constantly being improved to enhance cluster management, security, and performance. They address some potential downsides, such as the additional layer introduced by Kubernetes, but emphasize that Rook provides control and ease of use for administrators. They conclude by inviting attendees to get involved in the Rook and Ceph communities and offer support for any questions or contributions.
