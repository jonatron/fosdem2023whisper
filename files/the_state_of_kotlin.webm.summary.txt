The talk at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about the state of Kotlin and its future developments. The speakers discussed the current state of Kotlin, including its dominant use in mobile development, particularly for Android, as well as its growing popularity in web and backend development. They mentioned the challenges and improvements being made to the Kotlin infrastructure, including stability and performance issues in the IDE, build speed, and build setup complexity. They also highlighted the upcoming K2 compiler and Kotlin multiplatform as important developments in the Kotlin ecosystem. The K2 compiler is a major rewrite of the compiler front end, while Kotlin multiplatform aims to provide support for developing code that can be shared across different platforms, including JVM, iOS, and JavaScript. The speakers detailed the progress and plans for K2 and Kotlin multiplatform, including improvements in build speed, IDE support, stability, and compatibility. They also mentioned experimental features and improvements in Kotlin 1.8, such as better compatibility with Objective-C, a new compose version for desktop and web, and experimental support for Kotlin multiplatform on iOS. The talk concluded with a discussion of future developments, including further improvements in the memory manager, compilation time, and Objective-C interoperability. The speakers mentioned the goal of stabilizing Kotlin multiplatform mobile and the ongoing work on toolchains and infrastructure. The talk ended with a Q&A session, where questions were asked about the performance goals of Kotlin JS and Kotlin Native, as well as JetBrains' plans for using Compose in their IDEs.
