The talk given at the FOSDEM conference in 2023 was about Cgroup V2 and its impact on Linux resource control. The speaker, Chris Down, discussed how Cgroups have evolved over the last seven years to improve resource efficiency and reliability in large-scale environments. They highlighted the challenges faced by companies like Meta in effectively scaling their infrastructure and the importance of efficient resource control to prevent incidents and outages. The speaker also talked about the use of Cgroups in various container runtimes and the integration of Cgroups with other projects like SystemD and KDE. They introduced new tools like Senpai for memory management and IO control, as well as improvements in memory offloading and IO scheduling algorithms. The speaker emphasized the need for feedback and collaboration from the community to further enhance Cgroup V2 and address specific use cases and requirements.
