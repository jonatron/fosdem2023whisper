Emma and Jess gave a talk at the FOSDEM conference about the Creative Freedom Summit, a virtual event focused on promoting open source tools, spreading knowledge of how to use them, and connecting creatives across the FOSS ecosystem. The talk went over the summit's accomplishments, including living up to their primary goals and had 700 unique viewers from 54 different countries. They went over what went well, what they would improve upon and gave some resources to get involved in the open source design community.
