In this talk, the speaker introduces FIM, an improved image viewer that takes inspiration from the VIM text editor. The speaker explains that FIM is a Unix tool designed specifically for viewing images, not editing them. FIM is designed for command-line users and works well with keyboard shortcuts and scripting. The speaker showcases various features of FIM, including its different graphical output styles, its use of regular expressions and standard input/output, its ability to simulate key presses and key combinations, and its support for conversion pipelines and image filtering. The speaker also demonstrates how FIM can be used to organize and manage picture collections and mentions that FIM is highly configurable and customizable. The talk concludes with a mention of the upcoming release of FIM version 0.6 and a reminder that the FIM manual contains all the necessary information.
