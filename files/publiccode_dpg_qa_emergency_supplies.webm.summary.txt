In this talk, Robert Reed proposed GASCOS, or the Global Open Source Quality Assurance System, as a way to provide third-party quality assurance testing for open-source medical products. GASCOS includes the concept of asset provenance tracking, where each product is given a unique key that keeps its history and allows anyone in possession of the product to view its history publicly. This system would use simple encryption and an open-access online database to ensure quality and authenticity of the product, without requiring approval from a government.
