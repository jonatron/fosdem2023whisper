The speakers discuss the use of OpenTelemetry on Kubernetes to collect traces, metrics, and logs. They provide a brief history of open source observability, starting with the Zipkin project and the development of standardization through projects like OpenTracing and OpenSensors. They then explain the OpenTelemetry project and its various components, including the operator, SDK, and auto-instrumentation libraries. The speakers demonstrate how the operator can be used to deploy the collector, instrument workloads, and integrate with Prometheus. They also discuss the configuration of the collector and show examples of how the auto-instrumentation works. Finally, they explain how OpenTelemetry can be used to collect metrics and logs, and how it can integrate with existing systems like Fluent Bit. The talk concludes with a Q&A session where attendees ask questions about replacing existing logging systems and filtering health check requests.
