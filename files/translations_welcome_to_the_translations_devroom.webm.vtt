00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
So, let me put here some minutes.

00:09.000 --> 00:17.000
My name is Paulo, I'm from Brazil, and in Brazil I help the translation team for Debian,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
translation for Portuguese.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm a Debian developer too, so I work with packages in the translation for Portuguese,

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
and I'm coordinated the translation of everyone here this afternoon.

00:33.000 --> 00:42.000
We will have six talks today from different projects, and each of them they have 30 minutes,

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
so the speakers know they have 30 minutes to talk.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
I don't think so.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I'll bring this here.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Okay.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Leave here?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Thank you.

00:53.000 --> 01:03.000
So, each speaker will have 30 minutes to talk, including the QA part.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
I'd like to say thank you very much for FOSDEN organizers and for speakers to be here.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm sure that it will be a great experience for everybody.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
I believe this is the first time we have a translation everyone at FOSDEN.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
So, the first time we have a dedicated room for translation.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
So, this is good.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
I hope this is the first of many Debian rooms that you have on the future.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
And I hope everybody enjoys it.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I will be sitting here.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
If someone need something with me, talk with me, I will be there.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah, I'm using this blue shirt.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
So, that's it.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Thank you very much.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Thank you.

01:52.000 --> 02:21.000
Thank you.
