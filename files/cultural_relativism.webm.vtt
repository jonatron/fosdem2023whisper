WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.200
And without further ado, I will now turn it over to yield the floor to Claude.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.200
Thank you very much, sir.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.200
Can you hear me?

00:13.200 --> 00:14.200
Does this work?

00:14.200 --> 00:15.200
All right.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.200
It's working.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.200
Thank you.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.200
Okay.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.800
I'm here today to talk about cultural relativism as a prism for constructing cross-cultural

00:22.800 --> 00:24.800
communities.

00:24.800 --> 00:30.200
And let me start first by saying that the opinions expressed in this talk are mine.

00:30.200 --> 00:36.040
They don't necessarily reflect FOSDEM, my employer, or the projects that I work on.

00:36.040 --> 00:42.480
And in the course of this talk, there may be images or phrases that offend, but any

00:42.480 --> 00:47.760
such offense comes from lack of knowledge on my part and is unintentional.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.760
So who am I?

00:49.760 --> 00:52.280
I'm Claude Warren.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.920
I am a member of the Apache Foundation.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.760
I've been a member and a leader of cross-cultural teams.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.680
You can see my social media links there.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.560
I'm not on Wikipedia.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.560
That's my father.

01:04.560 --> 01:08.480
And if you look my father up, you will also find a link to my mother.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.720
And if you look them both up, you will find that they went to Northwestern University

01:12.720 --> 01:18.680
where they became immersed in the practice and theory of cultural relativism.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.840
They were students of Melville Herskovitz, who was himself a student of Franz Boas,

01:22.840 --> 01:28.240
who we will get to in a moment, but just tries it to say that both of my parents were cultural

01:28.240 --> 01:33.120
relativists and I grew up in a framework of cultural relativism.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.440
So let's start by defining culture.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.160
Culture is learned behavior.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.760
It's what you learn in your social framework.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.120
So it's what you learn from your family, from your friends, from your school, your city,

01:47.120 --> 01:51.000
your state, your country, they all have culture that influences you and helps you develop your

01:51.000 --> 02:00.960
culture, activities you participate in, any place that people gather, you develop a culture.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.920
So as an example, culture is not that you eat, but what you eat.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.120
On the left here is a picture of a durian fruit.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.040
Comes from South East Asia.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.360
There are signs in the Singapore transit stations that say don't bring this in the station,

02:15.360 --> 02:17.640
don't bring it on the vehicles.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.560
It's an acquired taste, I tried to acquire it, I couldn't.

02:21.560 --> 02:28.160
I'm told that it is just absolutely lovely once you've acquired that taste, but to me

02:28.160 --> 02:34.320
it smells like rotting flesh and I couldn't get past it.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.760
So the second one obviously is a cow.

02:37.760 --> 02:42.960
Most of the people in this room are going to look at that cow and say cow, milk, cheese,

02:42.960 --> 02:47.800
butter, maybe leather, beef perhaps.

02:47.800 --> 02:59.720
But if you're Hindu, that's a sacred animal and none of those things will come to mind.

02:59.720 --> 03:06.120
So let's look at another culturally determined perception.

03:06.120 --> 03:11.640
So it's not that you perceive time, but how you perceive it.

03:11.640 --> 03:19.240
So the Amaya people in the high Andes perceive time that the past is in front of them.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.560
So for about seven generations as they're talking about people, they will speak as though

03:22.560 --> 03:27.520
that person is in front of them and then beyond that time goes left to right.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.920
But this means that the future is behind them.

03:30.920 --> 03:37.760
So for us, back to the future is a great play on words and a fantastic movie title.

03:37.760 --> 03:43.960
For the Amaya, it's the way they perceive time, it's the normal way to perceive things.

03:43.960 --> 03:50.600
So to tell somebody from the Amaya culture to go forward to the future would sound just

03:50.600 --> 03:55.960
as ridiculous as somebody telling us to go backwards to the future.

03:55.960 --> 04:01.920
Okay, so now that we have some idea of the kinds of things that are involved in culture,

04:01.920 --> 04:05.120
let's look at cultural relativism.

04:05.120 --> 04:10.640
So cultural relativism is the idea that you can only understand beliefs and practices from

04:10.640 --> 04:13.840
within the construct of the culture itself.

04:13.840 --> 04:18.960
Now this is separate from moral relativism, which we're not going to talk about today.

04:18.960 --> 04:24.000
Cultural relativism has been used recently to make arguments for the continuation of

04:24.000 --> 04:28.880
human rights offenses on the grounds that are culturally based.

04:28.880 --> 04:35.320
And anthropology, cultural relativism is a means to get outside of your culture and

04:35.320 --> 04:36.320
understand another.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.600
So it's how do you step outside of your culture and get rid of those biases so that you can

04:40.600 --> 04:44.160
understand what's happening in another culture.

04:44.160 --> 04:48.840
But for people who are managing cross-cultural teams or multicultural teams, we can use cultural

04:48.840 --> 04:54.200
relativism as a prism through which we can discover miscommunication and we can discuss

04:54.200 --> 05:00.080
interactions between members.

05:00.080 --> 05:06.480
Cultural relativism was first defined as a, first recorded as a concept by Herodotus,

05:06.480 --> 05:11.000
who was a Greek historian from 484 to 425 BCE.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.400
And he was writing about Darius the Great.

05:14.400 --> 05:20.000
And Darius the Great was a Persian ruler from 522 to 486 BCE.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.520
Darius was inquiring about funerary customs in his empire, and as you can see, his empire

05:24.520 --> 05:26.880
was fairly vast.

05:26.880 --> 05:32.640
Now it turns out that in the eastern edge of his empire, the funerary custom was funerary

05:32.640 --> 05:34.520
cannibalism.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.440
And on the western edge, it was cremation.

05:37.440 --> 05:43.440
And when those two populations were told about the custom of the other population, they

05:43.440 --> 05:48.840
both were dismayed and abhorred the other process.

05:48.840 --> 05:55.880
This is the first recorded case of this concept of cultural relativism.

05:55.880 --> 06:02.920
Now it was established as axiomatic in anthropology in the early 20th century by Franz Boas.

06:02.920 --> 06:09.640
Franz Boas was appointed professor of anthropology at Columbia University in states in 1899.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.600
He is called the father of American anthropology.

06:12.600 --> 06:19.560
And he first articulated the idea of cultural relativism in 1887.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.760
But he didn't coin the term.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.360
That felt of Alan Locke.

06:23.360 --> 06:29.120
Now Alan Locke is a distinguished, is the first African American Rhodes scholar.

06:29.120 --> 06:36.440
He was reviewing this book by Robert Lowey.

06:36.440 --> 06:41.880
And Robert Lowey was a student of Franz Boas and was writing about cultural relativism.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.520
He was a cultural relativist as opposed to a cultural evolutionist, which was popular

06:45.520 --> 06:48.440
in the Victorian era.

06:48.440 --> 06:54.640
And when reviewing this book, Alan Locke was talking about Robert Lowey's extreme cultural

06:54.640 --> 06:55.640
relativism.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.600
And that's the first time the phrase occurs in print.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.800
Okay, so why do we care about cultural relativism?

07:03.800 --> 07:09.440
Well, we care about cultural relativism because the tools that anthropologists and ethnographers

07:09.440 --> 07:20.240
built to understand the culture, we can use to find the friction points between cultures

07:20.240 --> 07:23.280
in our cross-cultural teams.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.160
And those friction points are going to lead to misunderstandings.

07:27.160 --> 07:32.640
And misunderstandings can lead to a cohesive breakdown within the team where people on

07:32.640 --> 07:37.520
the team think they're being undercut or that other people are working against them, sabotaging

07:37.520 --> 07:39.720
their efforts.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.760
It can also lead to a misunderstanding of what your work assignment is.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.680
What is it that we're trying to build?

07:45.680 --> 07:50.840
And if you get that wrong, your app to build the wrong tool altogether and your project

07:50.840 --> 07:55.960
will have high potential to fail.

07:55.960 --> 08:00.320
And as I said, it can cause failure of the project.

08:00.320 --> 08:07.000
So let's look at a couple of examples of cultural relativism in action.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Poplight.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.960
Well, as it says here, with the exception of people with color vision deficiencies, everybody

08:14.960 --> 08:16.920
perceives color the same way.

08:16.920 --> 08:25.200
The light enters your eye, hits the cone, nerves fire, brain gets the message, color.

08:25.200 --> 08:29.120
Except some languages have no word for the color green.

08:29.120 --> 08:34.440
They instead use the color yellow or blue.

08:34.440 --> 08:40.640
So for those cultures that use those languages, stoplight only has two colors.

08:40.640 --> 08:46.000
And the phrase go on green makes no sense.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.800
In Irish, the color of a person is the color of their hair.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.800
Okay?

08:52.800 --> 08:58.960
So Eric the red, okay, he was an Irish, but you get the idea.

08:58.960 --> 09:04.360
If you want to speak about a person of color, so a dark, complexed person, that person

09:04.360 --> 09:07.520
is blue.

09:07.520 --> 09:16.400
So the translation of black lives matter and blue lives matter into Irish becomes the same

09:16.400 --> 09:19.240
phrase, right?

09:19.240 --> 09:26.040
So a distinction that is so important and so prevalent in American U.S. culture is lost

09:26.040 --> 09:31.000
in translation.

09:31.000 --> 09:38.600
So talk about icons, phrases, and gestures are all culturally centered and that is rather

09:38.600 --> 09:42.840
obnoxious, so let me make him stop.

09:42.840 --> 09:50.760
All right, so the thumbs up gesture generally means okay, all good, let's proceed, something

09:50.760 --> 09:53.360
along that line, some sort of approval.

09:53.360 --> 10:00.040
However, in some cultures that is a rude gesture.

10:00.040 --> 10:04.880
In ancient Rome, it was contrary to popular belief, the symbol that the gladiator should

10:04.880 --> 10:07.920
be put to death.

10:07.920 --> 10:19.360
In addition, in online forums, the definition has begun to modify and it is changing from

10:19.360 --> 10:25.960
approval to really a passive aggressive way to shut down a conversation.

10:25.960 --> 10:34.040
So all of this indicates that symbols, the meaning of symbols drifts over time and space.

10:34.040 --> 10:40.600
Now I moved from the U.S. to Ireland a little over 10 years ago and discovered that there

10:40.600 --> 10:45.200
are two countries separated by a common language.

10:45.200 --> 10:51.680
For example, the phrase just about, as in I just about caught the bus.

10:51.680 --> 10:56.720
Now in the U.S., you would say I just about caught the bus, that means I ran after it

10:56.720 --> 11:00.520
and it left without me, I missed it.

11:00.520 --> 11:05.080
In Ireland, I just about caught the bus means I ran after it and my gosh, I managed to get

11:05.080 --> 11:08.600
on the thing and I got a lift.

11:08.600 --> 11:15.720
So they describe the same phrase, both in English, both in the Western culture, describe

11:15.720 --> 11:22.160
two sides for opposite outcomes of the same event.

11:22.160 --> 11:27.320
So idioms are obviously another source of misunderstanding.

11:27.320 --> 11:33.680
So phrases like, there's more than one way to skin a cat, which means there's more than

11:33.680 --> 11:41.640
one solution and is perfectly acceptable in a lot of cultures, but there is obviously

11:41.640 --> 11:48.200
a chance of misunderstanding here, I actually had somebody ask me why would you skin a cat?

11:48.200 --> 11:56.760
Valid question, but I don't know, it's just one of those things I learned in my culture.

11:56.760 --> 12:01.360
And then we'll get to the nodding head guy now, in general we think of that as the nodding

12:01.360 --> 12:07.720
head meaning yes, but in Bulgarian culture that means no, and in fact shaking your head

12:07.720 --> 12:12.800
from side to side means yes, go figure.

12:12.800 --> 12:18.600
Now one more example here is that in some cultures it is acceptable and appropriate to

12:18.600 --> 12:24.120
interject a short word at the end of sentences of speakers during expositions.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.760
So this indicates that you're listening, you're paying attention.

12:27.760 --> 12:33.480
Now in English you can see this when people say yes at the end of somebody's sentence

12:33.480 --> 12:35.920
all the time.

12:35.920 --> 12:40.720
The BBC television show Antiques Roadshow has examples of this all the time.

12:40.720 --> 12:45.520
This is a very valuable place, yes, yes, they know that, but they're just, you know, let's

12:45.520 --> 12:47.600
keep the conversation going.

12:47.600 --> 12:54.200
However, in other cultures that's considered very rude to interrupt your speaker.

12:54.200 --> 13:05.960
My example three, there are words and phrases that are unacceptable in certain cultures.

13:05.960 --> 13:10.320
There are symbols and phrases that it would like to use them here would probably get me

13:10.320 --> 13:16.800
reported for a violation of the code of conduct and derail this entire conversation.

13:16.800 --> 13:22.440
Yet those words and phrases are acceptable in other cultural settings.

13:22.440 --> 13:28.320
So what cultural relativism teaches us is that when in a multicultural setting, if one

13:28.320 --> 13:40.040
is confused or triggered by a symbol, gesture or phrase, one should ask what it means.

13:40.040 --> 13:46.040
So Nelvo Herskovitz, judgments are based on experience and experience is interpreted

13:46.040 --> 13:48.680
by an individual in terms of their culture.

13:48.680 --> 13:56.880
As I said, Nelvo Herskovitz was a student of Franz Boaz and my parents' instructor.

13:56.880 --> 14:05.080
So let's look at a couple of examples of cultural relativism in cross-cultural teams.

14:05.080 --> 14:11.200
I worked on a project where we were transitioning the development from one culture to another,

14:11.200 --> 14:13.680
from one team to another.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.320
Really we're separate cultures.

14:16.320 --> 14:21.360
In the one receiving culture, it was not permissible to show failure.

14:21.360 --> 14:27.880
This was a career limiting move, don't fail, don't show failure.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.280
It was also not acceptable to disagree with somebody who was perceived to be of a higher

14:31.280 --> 14:34.600
rank or status.

14:34.600 --> 14:38.440
And we're trying to do open source development where everybody does everything in the public

14:38.440 --> 14:41.640
so that you can see what's happening.

14:41.640 --> 14:46.200
So this was a problem for us as we're trying to move this across.

14:46.200 --> 14:52.280
And so we came up with a couple of techniques that we used in this project to get around

14:52.280 --> 14:53.280
this problem.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.200
And the first problem was actually understanding what the problem was.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.800
You know, it was like, well, I don't want to check that into the source code control

14:58.800 --> 14:59.800
system.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.800
I don't want to do this.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.800
I don't want to do that.

15:01.800 --> 15:02.800
Why?

15:02.800 --> 15:03.800
Because we just don't do that.

15:03.800 --> 15:08.320
And then you have to work a little bit, you find out what the problems are at the base

15:08.320 --> 15:13.120
and figure out how you can work around this, work a solution.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.640
So what we did was we made it safe to fail, and we exhibited failures on the original

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
team.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.440
And one of the things we did was, you know, our source code control system, you would

15:21.440 --> 15:24.440
check stuff in any branch, and it would build the branch.

15:24.440 --> 15:29.920
And most of the time, that's going to fail if you're working on a development branch.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.840
So we exhibited that.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.640
We showed you, look, this happens all the time.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.360
All of the developers that have been working on this team, this always happens.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.760
Don't worry about it.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.000
Nobody's going to look at your failures unless you ask them to.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.440
I mean, if you want somebody to come in and say, you say, I can't understand why this

15:44.440 --> 15:45.440
is failing.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.440
Can you help me out?

15:46.440 --> 15:47.440
They're going to come look.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.000
But otherwise, they're going to ignore that.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Don't worry about it.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
It's safe.

15:51.000 --> 15:59.240
We pointed out that developers were not allowed to change the main branch of code, couldn't

15:59.240 --> 16:01.000
check stuff in directly to it.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.360
There really wasn't a way to break that.

16:04.360 --> 16:07.680
There were permission controls in place that were going to prohibit that.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.800
And in fact, if you were able to do that as a new developer, come in and put something

16:11.800 --> 16:15.920
in the main branch of code, then you had just found a bug in the permission system and you

16:15.920 --> 16:18.440
should be congratulated.

16:18.440 --> 16:23.480
We showed that all developers were following the same process.

16:23.480 --> 16:29.520
There weren't senior developers doing something different, had more ability to do stuff.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.000
We're developing code and they did have permission to do stuff that was different.

16:33.000 --> 16:40.720
But development of code, development of what the project was always the same for everybody.

16:40.720 --> 16:45.080
We also said that no code would be reviewed unless it was in the version control system.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.320
So this gave us the advantage we're a distributed team.

16:47.320 --> 16:50.080
You got to be able to look at the code and know that we're talking about the same code,

16:50.080 --> 16:55.200
the same lines, all of those great things that people we know about.

16:55.200 --> 17:01.200
And as a secondary effect of this, it meant that when desktops and laptops crashed, we

17:01.200 --> 17:06.640
had the code in the version control system, so a great benefit there.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.920
Nothing really out of the ordinary.

17:08.920 --> 17:14.000
We also made it safe to disagree.

17:14.000 --> 17:27.960
And doing this was probably an anathema to some agile purists here because we made it

17:27.960 --> 17:34.080
so that in the stand-up, we would have discussion and dissent.

17:34.080 --> 17:38.880
And so normally your agile thing is, what am I doing today, what did I do yesterday,

17:38.880 --> 17:41.560
what's blocking me, done.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.640
Now we're going to have discussion and dissent.

17:44.640 --> 17:50.320
And what this did was it meant that the new members were able to see how within the team

17:50.320 --> 17:54.880
we would discuss these issues and we would bring these problems up and talk about them

17:54.880 --> 18:00.240
and that this was okay, it was acceptable and over time they began to open up and to

18:00.240 --> 18:06.720
disagree and to present their perspectives on things and ask questions.

18:06.720 --> 18:13.800
And it really, they became very strong contributors to the project.

18:13.800 --> 18:20.440
And the other piece here is ask the questions and those indelicate questions need to be,

18:20.440 --> 18:25.840
it needs to be acceptable to ask indelicate questions.

18:25.840 --> 18:30.560
And this is because if I don't understand what you've said and I'm trying to understand

18:30.560 --> 18:41.880
that, at some point I'm going to ask a question that to you is going to be rude, not acceptable.

18:41.880 --> 18:45.840
And it needs to be okay for that to happen because we can't figure out where that point

18:45.840 --> 18:49.360
is and what that issue is if we can't talk about it.

18:49.360 --> 18:53.800
So you've got to be able to both ask the indelicate question and you've got to be ready to receive

18:53.800 --> 18:57.280
the indelicate question.

18:57.280 --> 19:04.960
Okay, so the net result here was we established a project culture.

19:04.960 --> 19:09.320
And the project culture wasn't, this is our culture and it's great, it's better, come

19:09.320 --> 19:10.960
do what we do.

19:10.960 --> 19:15.560
It was this is the culture of the project and let's make this work and let's all contribute

19:15.560 --> 19:18.840
to it and we can change the culture and do all of the things that we do.

19:18.840 --> 19:23.120
But make the culture of the project and live by that.

19:23.120 --> 19:32.320
So the second example, this all occurred in western culture and the conversation occurred

19:32.320 --> 19:33.320
on Slack.

19:33.320 --> 19:37.880
And basically there was a conference coming up and I said, what time do the doors open?

19:37.880 --> 19:42.760
I want to know what time do we start and close at the end of the day.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.840
And I was told, oh you go to this website and you'll see the times.

19:45.840 --> 19:53.200
So I went and I said, can't get there unless I'm registered.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.240
If you're not registered, why do you care?

19:56.240 --> 20:00.400
And so my co-workers came to me and said, well that was rather rude.

20:00.400 --> 20:06.400
And I thought, well, all right, yeah, I can see that as it could be rude.

20:06.400 --> 20:11.280
But I had worked with these guys for a number of years.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.440
They're planning a conference, they're under a lot of stress because we're getting close

20:14.440 --> 20:15.440
to the time.

20:15.440 --> 20:20.520
And they're trying to get through all their questions in a day to see, you know, you're

20:20.520 --> 20:23.040
coming in, you're going to get through all the questions, get those answers out the door,

20:23.040 --> 20:24.040
get to the next process.

20:24.040 --> 20:29.160
Let's see if we can get this project done and get this conference running.

20:29.160 --> 20:36.800
So the people I've known for a long time, and to me it would just take too long to say,

20:36.800 --> 20:40.840
I don't see why anyone attending, not attending the conference would be interested in starting

20:40.840 --> 20:41.840
times.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.520
Can you elaborate on why you want to know?

20:43.520 --> 20:44.520
All right.

20:44.520 --> 20:49.080
So yes, that would be a much politer way to say that.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.200
But I understood that they didn't have the time.

20:52.200 --> 20:59.480
So what I want to point out here is that the written word, it is often difficult to understand

20:59.480 --> 21:02.640
what's meant in the written word.

21:02.640 --> 21:08.320
You have no vocal or facial cues, and then I want to point out that those are culturally

21:08.320 --> 21:09.800
based as well.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.300
All right.

21:11.300 --> 21:18.960
So let's look at how to succeed, to find the culture of the project, not just in terms

21:18.960 --> 21:21.000
of words, but in actions.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.960
You want to talk about inclusivity and sensitivity, and you want to do the training for that?

21:27.960 --> 21:28.960
Brilliant.

21:28.960 --> 21:29.960
That's great.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.440
That tells you what to do.

21:31.440 --> 21:38.120
But it's the practice and the execution of the training that builds the culture.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.800
Practice makes the culture.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.920
You need to consider cultural differences when we're talking about discussions.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.840
We're going to have discussions about things.

21:45.840 --> 21:50.600
If you're talking about planning documents, you're trying to do planning for your project,

21:50.600 --> 21:54.880
you talk about use case definitions, you talk about documentation.

21:54.880 --> 22:03.880
Any of those things are rife, fine fields for finding cultural conflicts.

22:03.880 --> 22:09.400
Make it safe to disagree and to ask questions.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.920
Make it psychologically safe to fail.

22:12.920 --> 22:27.160
And the disagreements will surface the misunderstandings before they become, before the misunderstandings.

22:27.160 --> 22:34.480
The failure is a result of a misunderstanding that didn't rise to the level of a disagreement.

22:34.480 --> 22:39.280
So you make it safe to disagree, but then it didn't come up, and then you get a failure

22:39.280 --> 22:44.200
because there was a misunderstanding that wasn't a disagreement.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.520
So you want to explore both of those, in any case.

22:46.520 --> 22:53.640
You want to explore them both as possible friction point between cultures.

22:53.640 --> 22:58.600
So when you see either of those in your project, as you're working your teams, think about

22:58.600 --> 23:03.640
is there a cultural difference that might be contributing here?

23:03.640 --> 23:05.840
So exhibit the culture of the project.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.920
Again, practice builds culture.

23:07.920 --> 23:13.040
I can't stress that enough.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.040
Management has to lead by example.

23:14.040 --> 23:21.440
If I like to say no executive washrooms, do everything in public, failure must be public.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.320
By public I mean, obviously, if you're working in a corporate environment, that's going to

23:24.320 --> 23:27.120
be within the firewall of the project.

23:27.120 --> 23:37.000
Management work items, with the exception of personnel and other legally encumbered topics,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.760
must be in the public within the project.

23:38.760 --> 23:39.760
What is management doing?

23:39.760 --> 23:40.760
What is our goal?

23:40.760 --> 23:46.400
That's really going to help facilitate the communication up and down.

23:46.400 --> 23:53.800
Treat everyone, every objection, every suggestion, every point of view with respect.

23:53.800 --> 23:58.840
Assume that everyone working on the project is working towards success, and never attribute

23:58.840 --> 24:04.600
to malice what can be explained by ignorance or cultural difference.

24:04.600 --> 24:12.880
So in closing, when we're connected to others, we become better people, and the art of cross-cultural

24:12.880 --> 24:17.720
team management is to be a better person.

24:17.720 --> 24:24.320
So if I've offended anyone with any image or phrase during this talk, please accept my

24:24.320 --> 24:31.280
apology and understand that it was unintentional, but also let me know so that I can adjust my

24:31.280 --> 24:34.000
approach in the future.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Thank you.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Thank you, Claude.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
That was lovely.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Very much appreciated.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
If you are open to taking questions, we certainly have some time for questions.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Oh, dear.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Okay.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Okay.

24:44.000 --> 24:55.000
Would anyone like to ask a question of our speaker?

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Excellent.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
I'm headed your way.

24:57.000 --> 25:08.600
I should have spoken slower.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.280
Thank you for a wonderful talk.

25:11.280 --> 25:16.320
I wanted to ask you if you were in a position where you were leading a project or a team

25:16.320 --> 25:22.440
that is very multicultural, and those things also keep changing, you get new people, some

25:22.440 --> 25:29.560
people leave, and it's just a great diversity in the team, how would you approach learning

25:29.560 --> 25:34.640
more about their cultures and what is and isn't acceptable, and then trying to find

25:34.640 --> 25:37.280
a mesh that works for everyone?

25:37.280 --> 25:38.280
Okay.

25:38.280 --> 25:45.680
So the question is, if you're having a multicultural team where people are coming and going, lots

25:45.680 --> 25:52.960
of cultural change from the people that are in the team, how do you find a way to understand

25:52.960 --> 25:59.400
what everybody's culture is and what's acceptable for everybody?

25:59.400 --> 26:02.840
I think to answer the second part, I'm not sure that you can find something that's acceptable

26:02.840 --> 26:12.240
to everybody, that there's always going to be somebody who's a little tweet, I suppose,

26:12.240 --> 26:18.000
by things that go on, but it is being open to realizing that the problem is there, it's

26:18.000 --> 26:25.440
the first part, and then asking questions, and basically I think if you want to talk

26:25.440 --> 26:31.480
about documentation or something like that, then it would be documenting how you are open

26:31.480 --> 26:36.480
to these, how these questions can be asked, and what makes this a safe space to ask these

26:36.480 --> 26:37.480
questions.

26:37.480 --> 26:42.720
I don't know that there is a generic answer that says, this is how you do it, and it works

26:42.720 --> 26:49.000
across everything, because there are just so many differences.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.680
I have lots of great horror stories if somebody wants to come ask, but then they're all different,

26:54.680 --> 27:11.240
and they all have different solutions.

27:11.240 --> 27:15.360
You talked about the challenges that you saw in your projects, where people think in a

27:15.360 --> 27:21.920
very hierarchical way and don't want to engage or interact with someone that they perceive

27:21.920 --> 27:28.480
as higher ranks, and also people wanting to do everything in a perfect manner, and your

27:28.480 --> 27:37.000
resolution to that was to flatten the structure, enable communication, and everyone can fail,

27:37.000 --> 27:40.320
which is a very western way of thinking.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.880
So you try to bring them across to your culture.

27:42.880 --> 27:47.800
Have you ever tried to do it the other way, tried to engage in a project or let the project

27:47.800 --> 27:56.360
go in a more hierarchical way and make sure that people were rewarded on not making errors,

27:56.360 --> 28:02.560
and if so, what were your experiences?

28:02.560 --> 28:04.640
That's a really good question, and yes, it was.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.760
It ended up being a very western way of looking at it.

28:07.760 --> 28:12.720
I recognize that.

28:12.720 --> 28:17.280
I will say in defense of this one project is that we were moving from the western framework

28:17.280 --> 28:21.280
where we were working, and the project was working, and everybody was sort of depending

28:21.280 --> 28:26.600
on the project working, that all of our users were sort of dependent on the way the project

28:26.600 --> 28:34.080
had worked, so there was a lot of pressure to sort of stay the same course.

28:34.080 --> 28:41.200
Have I worked in other, if I think about it, I can probably come up with one, but no, it's

28:41.200 --> 28:45.400
probably the most honest answer.

28:45.400 --> 28:52.800
I haven't had a, I have worked in very hierarchical structures, that US corporate structure works

28:52.800 --> 29:00.560
that way, and that's why I'm an open source, that's about all I can say, without getting

29:00.560 --> 29:02.280
myself in serious trouble.

29:02.280 --> 29:03.280
Hey Claude.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.280
Hey Ferdinand.

29:04.280 --> 29:07.280
Fancy seeing you here.

29:07.280 --> 29:11.760
So you work for Ivan, which is originated in Finland, is there any fun story that you

29:11.760 --> 29:15.760
can share from the very Finnish culture that Ivan has?

29:15.760 --> 29:16.760
No.

29:16.760 --> 29:17.760
Well done, sir.

29:17.760 --> 29:18.760
I saw a handout here.

29:18.760 --> 29:19.760
How do you get from that?

29:19.760 --> 29:20.760
I don't know about that.

29:20.760 --> 29:21.760
Thank you.

29:21.760 --> 29:33.280
I would say, and it's not an exact answer, but in reference to the previous thing, so

29:33.280 --> 29:37.440
in some cultures, like at the meeting, you never actually discuss the thing, all the

29:37.440 --> 29:41.560
conversations happen in one-to-one conversation around the meeting, and you show up the meeting

29:41.560 --> 29:44.320
and the leader says, we should do this, and everyone says yes.

29:44.320 --> 29:48.240
But the meeting doesn't happen until a consensus is already gained, right?

29:48.240 --> 29:55.520
And that's actually, when there's a very controversial decision, I found that to be

29:55.520 --> 29:57.000
like actually a useful technique.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.520
Like I know that if we just have the meeting straight up, like we're going to have a huge

30:00.520 --> 30:01.520
argument.

30:01.520 --> 30:07.120
So like I go and talk to each of the people individually, I try and sort of canvas a solution

30:07.120 --> 30:11.240
so that then when we actually have the meeting, everyone has already agreed.

30:11.240 --> 30:16.600
So that's at least one situation where we can learn from other kinds of cultures and

30:16.600 --> 30:17.600
import that.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
Yes.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
Yeah, I would agree.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.120
It makes for very short meetings.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
I love that.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.120
All right.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.120
Folks, we're going to go ahead and begin to transition to the next speaker.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.120
Thank you.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.120
Greg Claude.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.120
Very much appreciated.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.120
Thank you.

30:28.120 --> 30:45.120
Thank you very much.
