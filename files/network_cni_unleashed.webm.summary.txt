In this talk, the speakers discuss the Container Network Interface (CNI) in the context of Kubernetes and other runtime engines. They highlight the lack of documentation for CNI and the need for more resources on how to create plugins and understand the CNI specification. They provide an overview of CNI plugins and how they work, including the use of configuration files and the importance of handling previous results in plugin chains. The speakers also demonstrate different use cases of CNI, such as bandwidth throttling and port mapping. They emphasize that CNI plugins can be used without Kubernetes and mention the need for monitoring and reconciliation to handle state changes in case of failures. Additionally, they mention the lack of logging in many plugins and the importance of debugging in such cases.
