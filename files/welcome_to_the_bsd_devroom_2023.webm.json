So just to remember you, just a few rules, you're not in your room anymore, so please keep all the rubbish on the trash bins and just try to leave the room clean. There's rules about no food and no drink, so just it's fine if you drink but try not to bring your food with you in the room. That's all and so the first COVID rule, so masks are not mandatory for the for them, so but we encourage you to use if you want to use one just feel free and we try to ventilate the room after each talk so maybe if people in the back could help us because we have just five minutes to switch from one speaker to the other so feel free to help us. So aside from that, this is the schedule for this morning. Pierre will be the first speaker this morning about the BSD drivers and we'll finish with the Chimera Linux, the last all finished at 2pm.
