WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay, so the goal also of this talk is to talk also about the progress and challenges

00:16.000 --> 00:18.800
of alternatives facing the big techs.

00:18.800 --> 00:28.960
So I want to first explain a bit why apps is key, why end user apps is important and

00:28.960 --> 00:34.120
also where are we, what are we doing with these apps, do they exist?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.360
So first who am I?

00:35.360 --> 00:42.360
So I'm Ludwig Dubost, I'm the creator of Xwiki, so I created the Xwiki software, so I don't

00:42.360 --> 00:47.920
know, does anybody who knows Xwiki here, oh cool, that's already, nice, who knows, and

00:47.920 --> 00:54.400
we also created a second software in my company, which is CripPad, who knows CripPad, cool,

00:54.400 --> 00:57.280
and that's pretty nice.

00:57.280 --> 01:04.360
And so we've been doing collaboration software for 20 years now, like 19 years, and we've

01:04.360 --> 01:14.400
been competing with software from the big techs, and it's not an easy thing to do, like

01:14.400 --> 01:22.280
you get lots of challenges there in order to actually build that software and get to

01:22.280 --> 01:24.640
the level that you can compete.

01:24.640 --> 01:33.880
And so I've done this at the same time I created the company, so it was a business goal to

01:33.880 --> 01:42.680
be able to live from building these applications as open source, and we have 50 employees,

01:42.680 --> 01:48.720
we're a remote first company, and we have employees in France and Romania and also now

01:48.720 --> 01:56.960
in Germany, and actually we hire, so if you're interested, come see what we do, and we are

01:56.960 --> 02:05.520
currently having more success, and that's not happening every year to be able to hire,

02:05.520 --> 02:12.000
so if you're interested to see how it works inside the company that has a goal of doing

02:12.000 --> 02:17.080
open source, of building open source applications, not only using them or installing them, but

02:17.080 --> 02:20.560
really creating them, come see what we do.

02:20.560 --> 02:27.160
So as a company, we're also a member of our ecosystem, we're a member of associations

02:27.160 --> 02:33.040
in France, for example the Systematique, OW2, the CNL, it's Conseil Nationale de Logiciels

02:33.040 --> 02:38.480
Libres, we're not a member of OSBA in Germany, but we actually want to be, it's planned,

02:38.480 --> 02:46.200
we're also a member of, yeah, we're also a member of CLIDIA, so APEL is actually a European

02:46.200 --> 02:55.160
entity over CNN and OSBA, we're trying to be active also in order to try to promote

02:55.160 --> 03:02.200
what the type of things that our companies do, and I'm a strong believer that European

03:02.200 --> 03:08.280
companies should work together more than they do together, and I know how difficult it is

03:08.280 --> 03:15.160
because it's super difficult because we're all very focused on what we do every day,

03:15.160 --> 03:17.880
but collaboration is actually super important.

03:17.880 --> 03:26.680
So first, one thing is, in 1995 technology was more like you buy machines, you buy or

03:26.680 --> 03:32.280
you build software, you install that software, and not all activities in our lives were actually

03:32.280 --> 03:35.640
dependent on software in 1995.

03:35.640 --> 03:45.000
It was not as important, but in 28 years, actually a lot of things have changed.

03:45.000 --> 03:53.320
Now your renting cloud servers, you could even run your server just on the cloud without

03:53.320 --> 03:59.440
worrying about buying in a machine, just take the service, but you could also run cloud

03:59.440 --> 04:05.680
servers, you could build and make your own software and run it, but also one thing is

04:05.680 --> 04:12.000
that almost everything, there is no business that's not dependent on software, it's starting

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
to be really hard to find anything that won't use any software, maybe some independent agriculture

04:18.000 --> 04:23.920
people might not need any software, but even though might still use some of them to be

04:23.920 --> 04:31.800
more efficient in their job, but you have a lot of activities that are highly dependent

04:31.800 --> 04:38.520
on software for every day work, and it can be a major competitive differentiator to

04:38.520 --> 04:43.640
use software in your business.

04:43.640 --> 04:50.720
We also see that there is a business imbalance, actually these are numbers, so I didn't put

04:50.720 --> 05:04.280
the source, I should have, basically the GDP of the tech sector in the U.S. is 10%, and

05:04.280 --> 05:09.560
there is data from Europe, from Europe's websites where you see GDP is 4%, so it's not easy

05:09.560 --> 05:12.880
to know if they're actually exactly talking about the same thing.

05:12.880 --> 05:19.800
The scoping of what is the tech sector is not always easy to match from one country

05:19.800 --> 05:29.560
to another, but we kind of intuitively know that there is much more tech in the U.S.,

05:29.560 --> 05:36.200
and that actually makes a huge difference, and if we look at the problem from the sovereignty

05:36.200 --> 05:42.360
point of view, so what I try to do here is to look at the different levels of what we

05:42.360 --> 05:52.080
use in technology, and what the situation is, and how Europe competes from that point

05:52.080 --> 06:00.120
of view, but there are some differences also in the way it works, so for example, you might

06:00.120 --> 06:06.320
not know how to make a hardware component, like you might not have the people that can

06:06.320 --> 06:14.400
do it, but once you bought it, the hardware component is yours, and that actually is something

06:14.400 --> 06:22.880
that is significantly different from the top, where you might not know how to do the cloud

06:22.880 --> 06:31.000
service, but you also don't own it, you don't have it, you use it, you use it remotely.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.960
Now, it's true, even in hardware, you're seeing evolutions where the world of software,

06:36.960 --> 06:44.160
the way software works, of software works, is starting to happen on the hardware level,

06:44.160 --> 06:54.520
you can turn on a feature in a Tesla remotely, and you can turn it off also remotely, so

06:54.520 --> 07:01.360
we might have situations where we don't own the software that is inside a hardware machine,

07:01.360 --> 07:07.200
so you have a lot of hardware that contains software, even a chip can contain software,

07:07.200 --> 07:13.600
whether or not they can turn off feature remotely from the internet is another story, but software

07:13.600 --> 07:18.560
is something that you can turn on, turn off remotely, and that's something very important.

07:18.560 --> 07:24.880
Now, we're not actually looking that good all over the place, we know in Europe how

07:24.880 --> 07:32.440
to make some semiconductors, for example, RM is a European company, was almost acquired

07:32.440 --> 07:38.800
by NVIDIA, but it didn't happen, but it's a UK company, so we still own a semiconductor

07:38.800 --> 07:43.840
company in Europe.

07:43.840 --> 07:48.800
We have some actors for hardware, but most of it is manufactured in Asia, so that's

07:48.800 --> 07:55.120
something important, and we know that with COVID, when we wanted masks in Europe, we

07:55.120 --> 08:02.680
didn't get them as fast as we wanted, as we needed them, so being able to manufacture

08:02.680 --> 08:04.920
our technology can be important.

08:04.920 --> 08:11.640
So now, cloud services, we do have European actors, but the good thing is that we have

08:11.640 --> 08:20.160
standardized open source tools in cloud services, so Linux, things like that, like Kubernetes,

08:20.160 --> 08:26.760
Docker, these are open source software, we don't always have the competences in Europe,

08:26.760 --> 08:34.240
we are not the ones that build them, most of them, but we do have access to the source,

08:34.240 --> 08:44.240
and we have actors, and it's possible to run VMs all over Europe, that's not a big problem.

08:44.240 --> 08:51.320
Now when you go to pass software, platform as a service, you have a major dominance

08:51.320 --> 08:52.520
from the actors.

08:52.520 --> 09:00.680
In France, there's been a complaint about the fact that the Health Data Hub, which is

09:00.680 --> 09:09.480
a national service doing statistics on health data, was run on Microsoft Cloud, and basically

09:09.480 --> 09:15.320
a lot of people say, what, you're running health data of all the people in France on

09:15.320 --> 09:21.000
an American system, how is that protecting our data, it's not compliant with GDPR, and

09:21.000 --> 09:26.800
basically the answer of the people that had made these decisions said there are not enough

09:26.800 --> 09:31.800
good APIs on the French cloud services to run it on the French cloud service, obviously

09:31.800 --> 09:37.080
everybody said no, there are, you have enough, there is enough to, maybe you're going to

09:37.080 --> 09:42.320
miss a little bit of stuff, maybe it's not going to be convenient for you, but it's possible,

09:42.320 --> 09:49.040
but they basically, the argumentation was that it was not good enough, the ministry

09:49.040 --> 09:55.520
in France basically bashed the French companies for not being good enough, and the answer

09:55.520 --> 10:00.440
of course the ecosystem, what are you waiting for to give money to the French company to

10:00.440 --> 10:08.000
allow them to be good enough, what are you doing instead of putting that type of service

10:08.000 --> 10:18.360
on foreign systems, so the technology is possible to develop it, a lot of it is open source,

10:18.360 --> 10:24.560
but companies like Amazon or Google cloud, Amazon web service, Google cloud or Microsoft

10:24.560 --> 10:31.520
are very ahead in terms of number of services that they have, when I looked as a company

10:31.520 --> 10:40.600
what technologies are available to deploy Xwiki software and Krippat software in an app store

10:40.600 --> 10:50.520
on cloud providers, I mean you have like different technologies on all of them, but they all

10:50.520 --> 10:57.160
have a lot of options for how you would sell your software on their app store, and when

10:57.160 --> 11:01.880
you look at what European companies have, they don't have systems to automatically deploy

11:01.880 --> 11:08.760
applications and sell them and put the price on them and people would start buying them,

11:08.760 --> 11:15.680
so they are really ahead, and when you go to SaaS you have like thousands of services

11:15.680 --> 11:23.000
all around the world, startups, and we do have national actors and a lot of these actors

11:23.000 --> 11:28.080
are not open source, so you have a lot of SaaS services and a lot are not open source

11:28.080 --> 11:35.400
and even the ones provided by Microsoft, Google and Amazon are not open source or they can

11:35.400 --> 11:39.000
be based on open source but they are not themselves open source, that means you cannot decide

11:39.000 --> 11:45.680
to self host them and take control of them, and that's actually something that we'll

11:45.680 --> 11:53.400
see is important, now in the collaboration space when you ask to the big companies what

11:53.400 --> 12:00.400
they need, they don't need one collaboration software, they need a whole stack, it was

12:00.400 --> 12:04.560
interesting in the previous presentation about the co-op, it was about deploying multiple

12:04.560 --> 12:11.240
apps and this is actually, bigger companies want all these software, they need all multiple

12:11.240 --> 12:17.240
software and they need them to work well together, so they need authentication, user management,

12:17.240 --> 12:23.880
they need of course email, chat, video conferencing, file storage, they want to edit documents,

12:23.880 --> 12:28.720
they want collaboration tools and then they even want to build custom apps, so they want

12:28.720 --> 12:37.400
a lot of different software and they want all these to be simple and easy, and when

12:37.400 --> 12:45.360
you start using apps, you become very quickly locked in, even when the app is open source

12:45.360 --> 12:54.080
by the way, when you put your data in a system, the way you put that data in makes you quickly

12:54.080 --> 12:59.760
locked, because it's complicated to get the data out and to adapt the way you work to

12:59.760 --> 13:07.240
other apps, even if the app is standard, in 20 years of Xwiki, I've heard so many people

13:07.240 --> 13:15.960
say that how they use to the fact that the button in Microsoft Office version X something,

13:15.960 --> 13:21.800
it's here on the screen, and you give them another tool where the button is on the right

13:21.800 --> 13:27.800
and they say it's difficult to use, like it's difficult to use because the button is on

13:27.800 --> 13:32.480
the right, no, they don't even know why it's difficult to use but it feels difficult to

13:32.480 --> 13:38.200
use to them, because they're so used to the way they worked before that it's very difficult

13:38.200 --> 13:46.360
to change, and so we have been trying to move people from Office to Wikis, so imagine how

13:46.360 --> 13:53.800
they tell you that it's difficult to use, no, it's not that difficult to use, you need

13:53.800 --> 13:58.280
to adapt your way of working, you need to learn a new tool, it's not that difficult

13:58.280 --> 14:04.240
to use, it's just, it takes time to adapt, you need to try to think how it works and

14:04.240 --> 14:12.200
try to adapt your way of working, so the lock-in is very high, and on SaaS software, the lock-in

14:12.200 --> 14:20.800
is actually immense, like I worked at Netscape in 1995, and we were talking about the lock-in

14:20.800 --> 14:27.480
of Microsoft on software when it was on premise software, and it's like oh Microsoft controls

14:27.480 --> 14:33.000
your software, like you're blocked on their software, but at least the software was in

14:33.000 --> 14:40.640
your company, and you could put firewall around it and potentially no data would go out, here

14:40.640 --> 14:45.280
now it's on the cloud, and so they will tell you it's going to be double the price to upgrade,

14:45.280 --> 14:49.280
but you didn't have to upgrade, you could decide to stay on the older version for a

14:49.280 --> 14:55.320
bit longer, and you didn't have to pay every year, you paid licenses for a long time, now

14:55.320 --> 15:05.000
you're paying every year, and if you don't pay on the first of January for your renewal

15:05.000 --> 15:12.120
or every month, they turn off the software immediately, so you're actually in an immense

15:12.120 --> 15:18.560
lock-in, the lock-in is actually way higher than it was in 1995 when a lot of the industry

15:18.560 --> 15:24.600
was complaining about that lock-in, and the data is controlled by the provider, there's

15:24.600 --> 15:32.640
a huge lack of standards on the structure of the data, so how that data, your basic

15:32.640 --> 15:39.360
formats are standardized, but in collaborative apps, even in wikis, I have to recognize

15:39.360 --> 15:45.920
that the xwiki software formats are not that standardized, we tried at some point to work

15:45.920 --> 15:53.240
with other wiki providers to work on common syntaxes, but never happened, like our syntax

15:53.240 --> 15:59.680
was based on something called wiki creole, which was discussed 15 years ago, but now

15:59.680 --> 16:04.000
everybody is using markdown, so there was something that people said that should be

16:04.000 --> 16:09.680
the standard, like a lot of wiki providers discussed, especially said that's a good

16:09.680 --> 16:14.840
common standard, but it's a completely other one that a lot of people now say, ah, it's

16:14.840 --> 16:21.360
great, but not many people discussed the markdown standard, it was just, ah, people liked it,

16:21.360 --> 16:30.520
and it started to become very liked, so the standards are very difficult to have, even

16:30.520 --> 16:36.920
when they exist, they're not necessarily adopted, and so if they're not adopted, they're not

16:36.920 --> 16:43.320
very useful to move data from one system to another, the complexity of the software makes

16:43.320 --> 16:49.600
it very difficult to switch, and one key aspect of the software industry is the winner takes

16:49.600 --> 16:56.240
it all approach, like this is basically why VCs love the tech industry, they put a lot

16:56.240 --> 17:02.160
of money, they try to win, and they like the fact that when you win, everybody else is

17:02.160 --> 17:08.520
dead, the winner makes 95% of the revenue, all the other people fight for the 5% that's

17:08.520 --> 17:14.000
left, and they love that because that's actually their goal, trying to be the winner, so what's

17:14.000 --> 17:18.080
interesting is that they don't necessarily win that much because they create 10 companies

17:18.080 --> 17:23.920
or 100 companies and only one makes it to the win, to being the winner, and so in the

17:23.920 --> 17:28.760
end they don't win that much money because they drop a lot of money on the way, but this

17:28.760 --> 17:37.160
is their goal basically of what they're trying to do, and one of the problems of the locking

17:37.160 --> 17:43.960
also is unfair business practices, you have a lot of unfair business practices because

17:43.960 --> 17:51.160
the providers are so powerful that it's very tempting to use that power to make more money,

17:51.160 --> 18:02.800
so if you ask a business lead to make 10% more revenue next year, if there is no difficulty

18:02.800 --> 18:06.800
to increase the price because everybody's locked they will just increase the price 10%,

18:06.800 --> 18:15.520
that's much easier than work hard to try to get new customers, and so in order to keep

18:15.520 --> 18:25.680
that approach running, they also try to, another approach is to, okay let's make other people

18:25.680 --> 18:33.460
buy my second software, I have a first software, if I can force the other people, if I can

18:33.460 --> 18:40.120
encourage them to use it, I give for free the second software, then at some point they

18:40.120 --> 18:44.720
become used to it, it's free, and at some point I say now it's not free anymore, Microsoft

18:44.720 --> 18:52.080
Teams is typically that approach, and Slack has actually complained about it, they actually

18:52.080 --> 18:58.920
sued about it because Teams was free, Office 365 is very expensive, they just gave Teams

18:58.920 --> 19:07.240
to everybody that has Office 365, and at some point they say now you have to pay, and all

19:07.240 --> 19:16.520
the others are dead in the meantime, so you have a huge amount of risks, of lack of sovereignty

19:16.520 --> 19:26.280
associated to this, so if you can stop all the software remotely, if we disagree with

19:26.280 --> 19:30.680
the US government, knowing that all these companies are US based, if we disagree with

19:30.680 --> 19:36.760
the US government, they could turn off the software, and even worse than that by the

19:36.760 --> 19:45.800
way, is that they don't even need to turn the software, because they just need to remind

19:45.800 --> 19:53.480
our government that they can turn off the software, and then the other government will

19:53.480 --> 19:58.920
start being, want less to disagree with the American government, because they know it's

19:58.920 --> 20:06.800
possible, or in negotiations it could be vaguely reminded that it's possible, and that's actually

20:06.800 --> 20:17.880
a big problem, and our ministry in France of economy and finance said no political sovereignty

20:17.880 --> 20:24.200
without digital sovereignty, I'm not sure what they actually do to try to avoid that

20:24.200 --> 20:31.720
situation, but they actually acknowledge it that there was a problem, that at some point

20:31.720 --> 20:39.600
you cannot state your political opinions if you're dependent so much on other people

20:39.600 --> 20:43.560
that have a different opinion than you.

20:43.560 --> 20:50.600
And at this point, I'm not sure how many businesses would still function if you shut down their

20:50.600 --> 20:58.920
collaboration tools, or if you shut down Microsoft today, what's the impact?

20:58.920 --> 21:05.200
It's a bit difficult to analyze, but how long would it take for the companies to start being

21:05.200 --> 21:09.160
able to do work again?

21:09.160 --> 21:17.160
And so from my point of view, that makes really collaboration apps very important, because

21:17.160 --> 21:25.240
we don't have the control on these apps, and it's the primary set of tools that people

21:25.240 --> 21:33.320
use, actually I didn't ask that question, in your company, which ones are using Microsoft

21:33.320 --> 21:39.880
or Google?

21:39.880 --> 21:48.920
And so it's the primary tool that people are using, and they get really used to it.

21:48.920 --> 21:55.320
And it's also the primary authentication system that people use.

21:55.320 --> 22:02.280
Most companies will put Azure AD, LDAP, Active Directory, not LDAP, Active Directory, as

22:02.280 --> 22:07.800
well as the authentication system.

22:07.800 --> 22:15.640
And basically, they end up also being almost ready to deploy servers.

22:15.640 --> 22:20.440
So when you have Azure AD, you have an Azure account, you're one click away from deploying

22:20.440 --> 22:23.640
servers on the Microsoft system.

22:23.640 --> 22:29.560
So people buy Office 365, they tell people, you need to connect Office 365 to Azure AD

22:29.560 --> 22:35.160
to manage your users, and then you're one click away to deploy servers.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.360
And a lot of users like simplicity.

22:38.360 --> 22:46.000
If it's simple to click, they start using the other servers, and they do a lot of work

22:46.000 --> 22:49.920
to make all this work as easy as possible together.

22:49.920 --> 22:58.000
Do they do a good job is another question, but they have the possibility to make it easy.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.760
We might be happy that they're not always very good at it.

23:01.760 --> 23:08.560
And so that gives us some opportunities to provide other solutions.

23:08.560 --> 23:12.920
And so it's the entry point of all software.

23:12.920 --> 23:21.680
And the biggest problem from my point of view has been the bundle issue, is that a lot of

23:21.680 --> 23:24.640
software becomes bundled as a package.

23:24.640 --> 23:32.000
And so when you go to Microsoft's website to buy, you say, I need Office, you will be

23:32.000 --> 23:38.320
proposed the whole Microsoft suite, not only Office 365, and you will have this software

23:38.320 --> 23:40.440
plus this software plus this software.

23:40.440 --> 23:46.160
And you'll see that the difference of pricing is not always very high between the package

23:46.160 --> 23:47.160
rules.

23:47.160 --> 23:52.120
And I'm not even sure it exists, only Office 365, only Office.

23:52.120 --> 23:57.920
You will get for free one thing, even what you don't need.

23:57.920 --> 24:03.720
This was actually the problem of computers bundled with Windows, which were bundled with

24:03.720 --> 24:05.040
Internet Explorer.

24:05.040 --> 24:11.680
I said I worked at Netscape, and I can remember how it killed Netscape's business around the

24:11.680 --> 24:16.280
browser when Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer in Windows.

24:16.280 --> 24:21.920
Who would buy a browser if you have one for free with Windows when you get your computer,

24:21.920 --> 24:24.120
which, and at the time, you were paying Windows?

24:24.120 --> 24:29.000
Well, in the meantime, there's a lot of things that have changed, because now browsers also

24:29.000 --> 24:32.680
got free because you can make money through advertisement.

24:32.680 --> 24:37.600
But that's actually potentially a problem, because you can make money through advertisement,

24:37.600 --> 24:41.800
but we also got tracking, thanks to that.

24:41.800 --> 24:48.440
So we get browsers for free, but we get tracking, and that's also a problem of sovereignty.

24:48.440 --> 24:51.200
So now they bundle even more.

24:51.200 --> 24:57.160
They bundle apps, but they also bundle Office 365 with the cloud, with the pass, with the

24:57.160 --> 24:58.160
yes.

24:58.160 --> 25:06.280
Microsoft has a whole offer, servers, yes, a pass, and apps.

25:06.280 --> 25:11.280
When you go see a client with you, ah, I have a wiki, would you like my wiki?

25:11.280 --> 25:15.600
Well, sorry, I already have it for free in the whole offer.

25:15.600 --> 25:23.000
Like, no, you need, you know, and I even, I think I had a few cases like that, is for

25:23.000 --> 25:29.080
a department that's part of a big company, if they buy another software, they pay for

25:29.080 --> 25:30.960
it.

25:30.960 --> 25:41.240
If they use Microsoft software, the central entity pays for it, and it's divided, and

25:41.240 --> 25:45.160
they pay the same share of it whether they use it or not.

25:45.160 --> 25:52.240
So basically, you come as a provider, and you have a cost, and the Microsoft software

25:52.240 --> 25:55.640
you're competing with has no cost.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.800
It's free.

25:56.800 --> 26:02.760
But it has a cost in reality because everybody then will start, some people will start using

26:02.760 --> 26:08.880
some of the software, and when they renew the license with Microsoft three years later,

26:08.880 --> 26:17.040
Microsoft comes and counts everything that is being used, and they set the new bill.

26:17.040 --> 26:23.800
And so, the company will end up paying it, the fact that they started using that software.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.320
And so, it's very difficult to compete.

26:27.320 --> 26:35.120
And so, everything's, actually, NextCloud has sued on this, I think, antitrust.nextcloud.com,

26:35.120 --> 26:42.000
I think, I have the link a bit later.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.800
And so, because it's a real antitrust issue, in the end, you cannot compete with that type

26:48.800 --> 26:52.960
of situation.

26:52.960 --> 27:00.560
And so, some people say, and especially this is true in France, on our government, they

27:00.560 --> 27:04.320
say, we need to build better software companies.

27:04.320 --> 27:12.160
So, the problem is not the way the competition works, or the way these companies operate

27:12.160 --> 27:13.160
and so on.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.160
That's not the problem.

27:14.160 --> 27:19.160
The problem is we don't have a French one, or we don't have a European one.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.240
And so, say, let's build unicorns and make companies.

27:22.240 --> 27:30.040
But in reality, when you look at unicorns, is that first, well, if they actually get

27:30.040 --> 27:35.240
very big, if they manage to get very big, they will behave exactly the same way.

27:35.240 --> 27:40.040
And it's not going to help the people and the small companies.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.600
It's going to be a bit less a sovereignty issue, because maybe our government will have

27:43.600 --> 27:45.640
a little more control on them.

27:45.640 --> 27:51.600
But it's, we are not going to get our own sovereignty, because we're going to be very

27:51.600 --> 27:53.320
dependent on this big company.

27:53.320 --> 28:02.600
The other problem is that most of these unicorns are made with fun VCs.

28:02.600 --> 28:08.800
Most of them of these VCs are actually not even European, and VCs want to make money,

28:08.800 --> 28:11.320
so they want to sell the company at some point.

28:11.320 --> 28:16.000
And it's much easier to sell it to the ones that have the most money, which are the current

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
American companies.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.920
So, in the end, there is a very big chance that all these unicorns will either die, because

28:22.920 --> 28:29.480
they don't work well enough, or they're going to be bought by the same companies that are

28:29.480 --> 28:34.240
currently leading the market.

28:34.240 --> 28:40.520
And another thing, yeah, and that's actually, they usually use the American cloud providers

28:40.520 --> 28:44.720
for their services, and so these cloud providers see everything they do.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.080
So when something works well, they can replicate it.

28:47.080 --> 28:53.680
This is actually a complaint against Amazon, even in the US, that small businesses that

28:53.680 --> 28:57.480
sell on Amazon are showing to Amazon everything that works.

28:57.480 --> 29:04.200
And surprisingly, at some point, you get products that pop up made by Amazon instead, and they

29:04.200 --> 29:06.760
take the market.

29:06.760 --> 29:11.120
And so they're supposed to not look at the statistics, but we don't know what really

29:11.120 --> 29:13.600
happens.

29:13.600 --> 29:22.800
And now, how can open source help to solve these type of problems?

29:22.800 --> 29:28.920
So one thing I believe is very important is that if you try to build local companies,

29:28.920 --> 29:34.960
French ones, German ones, UK ones, even though UK is not in Europe anymore, but still in

29:34.960 --> 29:37.400
Europe, physically.

29:37.400 --> 29:46.120
But if you try to build your own local companies, and you all do it at the same time, at some

29:46.120 --> 29:48.840
point, you'll have a problem.

29:48.840 --> 29:53.600
And because suppose one of them buys the other one, you're going to have one very big French

29:53.600 --> 30:00.440
company or one very big German company, and maybe, I don't know, a Swedish one.

30:00.440 --> 30:07.280
And the problem is that this won't be sovereignty for the countries that don't own these companies.

30:07.280 --> 30:15.880
So, you might have a bit of sovereignty in France, but no sovereignty in Poland.

30:15.880 --> 30:26.080
And so if you try then to tell, so let's invest all, let's start using the software from this

30:26.080 --> 30:32.440
European company, like in Poland, they're not very interested to use the software from

30:32.440 --> 30:36.800
a French one, and that doesn't give them that much sovereignty.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.760
So an open source works very differently.

30:39.760 --> 30:48.360
If we invest in open source in France, it can be used in Germany, and it can give sovereignty

30:48.360 --> 30:52.320
to Germany because Germany can control the software.

30:52.320 --> 30:56.840
German companies can build competence on top of that software.

30:56.840 --> 31:01.160
And that's true in Poland, and that's true in Romania, et cetera.

31:01.160 --> 31:10.600
So if we all in different countries co-invest in open source, we can all get more sovereignty

31:10.600 --> 31:11.600
out of it.

31:11.600 --> 31:18.520
And we also can get individual sovereignty out of it because any individual can then

31:18.520 --> 31:19.520
make use of it.

31:19.520 --> 31:25.280
So I'm sure I don't have to convince that much about open source here, but it's important

31:25.280 --> 31:34.400
to remind these arguments which can be useful if you meet people in your own countries.

31:34.400 --> 31:40.480
So also open source is usually a bit more open to standards, and if the provider doesn't

31:40.480 --> 31:45.080
want to adapt this software to standards, then somebody else can do it.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.720
You have this possibility.

31:46.720 --> 31:58.000
So open source will allow to adapt software to standards when providers don't want to

31:58.000 --> 32:03.280
do it because it's not in their economical interest.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.280
It's very hard.

32:04.280 --> 32:07.440
Like if you look at software, you very often have a lot of import tools.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.960
You very rarely have export tools.

32:10.960 --> 32:15.960
But anybody can build the export tools on open source software.

32:15.960 --> 32:26.520
And one aspect that is also interesting is that we can reuse also US open source software.

32:26.520 --> 32:31.000
Like we need, but we need, however, to build local competence.

32:31.000 --> 32:39.640
If we use massively very large US based software, but we're not building local competence on

32:39.640 --> 32:44.520
it, we will risk having a lack of sovereignty.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.880
Because we don't have the people that can take over.

32:47.880 --> 32:54.560
So we can reuse open source software from anywhere in the world, but it's also important

32:54.560 --> 32:57.520
to invest in the competence.

32:57.520 --> 33:06.480
So if we start building massive solutions, and not only competence about how to use them,

33:06.480 --> 33:11.840
but competence how they're built, how they're made inside the software, it's very easy to

33:11.840 --> 33:14.080
use open source.

33:14.080 --> 33:19.040
It's much more difficult to improve an open source software.

33:19.040 --> 33:23.400
Like you need to build competence on the software itself.

33:23.400 --> 33:31.880
So now I want to look a bit at what actually exists.

33:31.880 --> 33:38.640
Because we're looking, and I've been maybe a bit looking pessimistic because it's hard,

33:38.640 --> 33:39.800
it's tough.

33:39.800 --> 33:44.720
But actually, what's interesting is that we have tons of great open source software

33:44.720 --> 33:46.520
in Europe.

33:46.520 --> 33:54.960
And I'm sure I missed a lot, because I spend most of my time on our own software.

33:54.960 --> 34:00.560
And I'm sure I missed a lot, but I mentioned the list of types of software that companies

34:00.560 --> 34:03.240
are looking for for collaboration.

34:03.240 --> 34:08.760
And so for example, in video conferencing, we have software like Jitsi, which has been

34:08.760 --> 34:10.120
created in France.

34:10.120 --> 34:17.040
Actually, core developers are in the US now, but it was created in Strasbourg.

34:17.040 --> 34:22.240
Big Blue Button, Canadian, it's open source, not developed in Europe.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.440
Next Cloud Talk, developed in Europe.

34:24.440 --> 34:33.160
Only Office is developed in Letony, if I'm correct.

34:33.160 --> 34:39.400
There are also issues around Only Office, because it's linked to Russia.

34:39.400 --> 34:51.560
So we also need to have more control on it, on the development of it, collaboration.

34:51.560 --> 34:56.880
On collaboration, Next Cloud, Xwiki, Krippad, project management, projects like Tulip, open

34:56.880 --> 34:57.880
project.

34:57.880 --> 35:04.320
We have a lot of software on authentication, software like Lemoneldap, Univention, on email,

35:04.320 --> 35:13.240
we have Open Exchange, we have Sogo, BlueMind, and on file management, software like Next

35:13.240 --> 35:15.040
Cloud, PDO, Krippad.

35:15.040 --> 35:18.560
And on chat, we have great solutions like Matrix.

35:18.560 --> 35:24.840
So we actually have all the bricks existing.

35:24.840 --> 35:34.360
Now, they're all provided by different companies, different providers, and they do, they're

35:34.360 --> 35:40.280
not as integrated as the other solutions will be.

35:40.280 --> 35:47.560
And another aspect, I'll come back to that, the integration aspect.

35:47.560 --> 35:53.200
Another aspect is that actually building open source business, it works.

35:53.200 --> 36:00.520
Like all these software have core teams, the software I mentioned, they do have core teams.

36:00.520 --> 36:10.960
Most of the companies, most of the software have a core team that is working for at least

36:10.960 --> 36:17.320
one company that has regular revenue out of this software, and they're able to fund the

36:17.320 --> 36:21.240
roadmap and have a regular development on top of this software.

36:21.240 --> 36:33.120
So it's possible, and I can attest to it, with my company, we didn't raise any money,

36:33.120 --> 36:39.560
and for 19 years we've been able to pay the people in the team and grow, and we've even

36:39.560 --> 36:48.960
been able to create a second software out of the work that we were doing on the first

36:48.960 --> 36:49.960
one.

36:49.960 --> 36:54.480
So it's possible to fund the company.

36:54.480 --> 37:00.240
Now, at the beginning it's not easy, like the first years you need to build critical

37:00.240 --> 37:11.880
mass, and sometimes you have an issue of competition, so you're not necessarily finding enough

37:11.880 --> 37:19.520
money to build it quickly at the level that it can compete, but it's possible to find

37:19.520 --> 37:26.760
business and it progresses, the better your software is, the more companies are interested

37:26.760 --> 37:30.920
in it, when it's good enough, the companies get interested in it.

37:30.920 --> 37:36.640
So you have moments where companies will just go to the other provider, the winner takes

37:36.640 --> 37:41.680
it all, so you get very little market share, but then at some point they get more interested

37:41.680 --> 37:45.640
and you get more prospects.

37:45.640 --> 37:49.880
So how does open source business work?

37:49.880 --> 37:57.160
You can, clients do buy support, but you need also to have the price right, so if you put

37:57.160 --> 38:03.800
it too expensive then clients might just go away, but if you put the right price you get

38:03.800 --> 38:06.080
clients that buy support.

38:06.080 --> 38:13.960
You also have clients that sponsor development, but you have issues of dumping and bundling

38:13.960 --> 38:22.840
that slows it down, like you cannot sell to everybody because you have competitors and

38:22.840 --> 38:30.480
their software is given for free or cheaper, and Xwiki knows it very well because we've

38:30.480 --> 38:37.280
been competing with Xwiki with conference, anybody has conference, is there a company?

38:37.280 --> 38:43.000
So while you can try to convince your companies to switch to Xwiki, we have importers and

38:43.000 --> 38:50.760
we have, and Atlassian has kept increased the price over the time and they actually,

38:50.760 --> 38:57.160
they changed a lot the strategy, so they had a pretty low price for small businesses and

38:57.160 --> 39:01.080
now they say small businesses you have to go on the cloud.

39:01.080 --> 39:06.960
We stop doing the small price software even though it makes money.

39:06.960 --> 39:11.680
If you look at the finances of Atlassian it does make money, so it's a conscious choice

39:11.680 --> 39:13.920
to make more money.

39:13.920 --> 39:18.000
It's not something that doesn't work, it's something that works, but now that they've

39:18.000 --> 39:25.760
done that we have a lot of calls and we get much more clients, and even though we never

39:25.760 --> 39:30.480
got the money of these clients to build our own software, so we've been able to build

39:30.480 --> 39:35.520
the software with the money of other clients and now we're having more clients coming,

39:35.520 --> 39:42.680
so I think it's a clear proof that the dumping and the bundling approaches are slowing down

39:42.680 --> 39:47.120
open source and there are unfair practices.

39:47.120 --> 39:54.040
There are also some good news, for example European initiatives, NGI, so we at Xwiki

39:54.040 --> 40:01.240
we've been able to benefit from that on CripPad in particular because CripPad doesn't have

40:01.240 --> 40:02.240
that many clients.

40:02.240 --> 40:07.000
It has almost no enterprise clients, it's just starting to have enterprise clients and

40:07.000 --> 40:11.480
it's been mostly funded with research money.

40:11.480 --> 40:19.400
We do have some clients, we have donations and subscriptions on our instance, but it

40:19.400 --> 40:27.600
would not be enough to pay for that software which requires a lot of work.

40:27.600 --> 40:33.560
So NGI is providing funding for companies and that's really a great thing.

40:33.560 --> 40:41.520
They also, the EU started to pay for bug bounties on open source software, we've been able to

40:41.520 --> 40:45.040
benefit from it also and that's been great.

40:45.040 --> 40:52.280
GAIAX is interesting, but there are also issues with it from my point of view, it's

40:52.280 --> 41:01.320
not easy to understand, to see how four small providers like us that are doing apps, how

41:01.320 --> 41:08.640
to work together with the big cloud providers and big companies that are currently running

41:08.640 --> 41:09.640
GAIAX.

41:09.640 --> 41:17.840
We're not seeing also open source being as put in front in the GAIAX project.

41:17.840 --> 41:23.920
So there are initiatives in Europe to help and we've seen that it's becoming more and

41:23.920 --> 41:26.680
more in subject, that's interesting.

41:26.680 --> 41:33.440
In France we have the French government decided to put some funding, so on one side they're

41:33.440 --> 41:40.560
opening the door to American software, they also reacted to the fact that from the GDPR

41:40.560 --> 41:48.920
perspective there is a huge problem with the cloud act, this is the Max-Ramp act and basically

41:48.920 --> 41:59.000
they're recognizing that it's illegal to host data on American companies systems, but it

41:59.000 --> 42:05.160
seems to be illegal but we don't really know if they consider it illegal for everybody,

42:05.160 --> 42:12.080
is it illegal only for the public service, it's illegal for all the companies, it's

42:12.080 --> 42:18.680
unclear but they started to say, okay for example the national education should not

42:18.680 --> 42:26.280
deploy Microsoft software anymore, but on the other side they're proposing that French

42:26.280 --> 42:35.640
companies are going to build clouds to deploy Microsoft and Google software on them and host

42:35.640 --> 42:40.240
it instead of Microsoft and Google and that will be okay.

42:40.240 --> 42:44.400
So they will control the software but they won't, they will control the hosting but they

42:44.400 --> 42:47.840
won't control the software.

42:47.840 --> 42:51.800
On the other side they say okay let's fund a little bit alternative, so they decided

42:51.800 --> 42:57.440
to put 50 million but they didn't put it on open source, we are partners in some of the

42:57.440 --> 43:03.760
projects to try to get funding for Xwiki and Crip Pad and try to build also additional

43:03.760 --> 43:10.480
solutions, so you have a bit of a mixed message, on one side they like open source, on the

43:10.480 --> 43:17.800
other side they don't promote only open source so it's not always clear.

43:17.800 --> 43:24.440
So you have messages, there are better news in Germany where you have specific funding

43:24.440 --> 43:33.000
for open source platforms with the sovereign workplace project, actually at Xwiki we have

43:33.000 --> 43:39.840
had the chance to be called in and that is actually great news for us and you have a

43:39.840 --> 43:45.400
bunch of great open source software that are part of that project, you also have additional

43:45.400 --> 43:50.960
initiatives like the sovereign tech fund and there is a specific entity called the

43:50.960 --> 43:59.840
Centrum for Digital Server Initiate, then this, my German is good, and you have the

43:59.840 --> 44:06.640
open code project, so a bit better news but at the same time it's never completely won,

44:06.640 --> 44:13.640
you have internally governments, some people pro and some people that will continue to

44:13.640 --> 44:20.520
push for it's not so important, let's use American software.

44:20.520 --> 44:27.360
So there are also, so the challenges I've talked about them, the antitrust is clearly

44:27.360 --> 44:35.480
bundling and unfair practices and trying to kill competition with aggressive pricing.

44:35.480 --> 44:41.760
I've seen cloud develop and I mean the typical cloud business model is let's give things

44:41.760 --> 44:48.840
for free and then increase the price, let's get the users when they're in, when I'm sufficiently

44:48.840 --> 44:51.600
known, let's change the price.

44:51.600 --> 44:56.960
You could say open source, that's the same thing, let's make it open source and at some

44:56.960 --> 45:05.080
point let's give it for free and let's change the price or let's stop being open source

45:05.080 --> 45:07.200
so some companies do it.

45:07.200 --> 45:12.960
There is a big difference however is that what you put as open source you can never

45:12.960 --> 45:21.960
take away, so maybe you can change your price, stop do open source and do your own life and

45:21.960 --> 45:28.120
turn your back on the people that helped you because you have a lot of people that helped

45:28.120 --> 45:33.880
you when you do open source, you give them a lot but they also give you a lot, I can

45:33.880 --> 45:38.860
say that I have a lot of people that gave us things, gave us contribution, make the

45:38.860 --> 45:40.360
software known.

45:40.360 --> 45:46.720
The user's crypto platform wouldn't be what it is with all the people making it known

45:46.720 --> 45:50.640
so we have a lot of people helping so you can do that but you can never take away the

45:50.640 --> 45:57.480
code and that's a very, very important difference versus the strategy of the cloud providers

45:57.480 --> 46:02.960
that gives things for free and increase the price later.

46:02.960 --> 46:12.640
This is also why on my side I'm a big proponent of AGPL with no CLA so no retaining the copyright

46:12.640 --> 46:20.000
of everything that people give you because this shows that you will not turn your back

46:20.000 --> 46:27.480
on open source or at least you will have to give back all the code and redo what people

46:27.480 --> 46:31.280
gave you.

46:31.280 --> 46:37.720
For CRIPAD it's AGPL, XWIC is LGPL and we don't want to change it because this is what

46:37.720 --> 46:43.440
we did and we don't want to change that but CRIPAD is AGPL and we have never taken any

46:43.440 --> 46:53.760
CLA on contributions and we believe we cannot go away of what we're doing.

46:53.760 --> 47:00.200
There is another challenge which is open source financing so the initial financing of an open

47:00.200 --> 47:06.200
source project is very difficult, it's something that is tough.

47:06.200 --> 47:10.680
There is one thing that is very important is that a lot of people when they build open

47:10.680 --> 47:18.920
source software and they try to live from it they question the open source business model

47:18.920 --> 47:23.520
is that yeah but somebody is going to steal my software or somebody is going to compete

47:23.520 --> 47:32.080
with me etc etc and you always have difficulties but sometimes it's very important to understand

47:32.080 --> 47:37.200
that the main difficulty is not the business model, the main difficulty is do a good enough

47:37.200 --> 47:39.400
software.

47:39.400 --> 47:49.680
In many cases when you tend to think that you should be selling it instead of giving

47:49.680 --> 47:55.640
it away as open source, well sometimes that's not the problem, the problem is that the software

47:55.640 --> 48:01.040
is not good enough, you need to be better, the competition is too good and you need to

48:01.040 --> 48:03.080
work more on your software.

48:03.080 --> 48:09.200
We had phases where it was a bit difficult at XWIC and what we did we worked on the software

48:09.200 --> 48:15.840
and things improved so you have to look at that.

48:15.840 --> 48:24.960
We also decided at XWIC to do extensions that are open source but paying and so I usually

48:24.960 --> 48:31.480
have a bit of a complexity to explain that, I even had some people that say but so they

48:31.480 --> 48:43.280
asked but can I take it or can I reuse it for free, I said yeah take the source, rebuild

48:43.280 --> 48:51.160
it, remove the license check and you can use it, it's open source so it's not open source

48:51.160 --> 48:55.720
I cannot use it for free, that's not open source, it's about the source, it's not about

48:55.720 --> 48:59.840
whether or not it's easy for you to use it.

48:59.840 --> 49:06.720
So we decided to have some extensions of XWIC which are open source but either you go find

49:06.720 --> 49:12.400
the source and you go and take it and build it yourself and install it yourself or you

49:12.400 --> 49:18.000
use our app store and in one click you can use it, pay for it and buy it and it's been

49:18.000 --> 49:23.800
very useful for us because it allows also to explain to companies that concept, the

49:23.800 --> 49:29.960
fact that the important part is the fact that it's open source, it's not that it's free

49:29.960 --> 49:35.320
and that's what is important in what we do but it allowed to explain that and it helped

49:35.320 --> 49:40.640
actually improve the relationship with some of our clients which tend naturally to say

49:40.640 --> 49:45.760
okay if I don't have to pay, I don't pay, I don't help the project, I don't need to

49:45.760 --> 49:54.160
pay so you have to find that balance also between the commercial offers and the freedom.

49:54.160 --> 49:59.880
Sometimes when you build open source you are too idealistic in a way that okay everything

49:59.880 --> 50:03.800
should be free but the problem is that when everything is free you have a lot of people

50:03.800 --> 50:09.560
that don't understand that they actually should help the project because this project will

50:09.560 --> 50:18.880
not survive without funding, you need money to survive to make the software, it's necessary.

50:18.880 --> 50:22.560
Another aspect is that it's actually very difficult to make partnerships with service

50:22.560 --> 50:24.080
and cloud companies.

50:24.080 --> 50:30.760
Right now Xwiki has not been able to do good partnerships with other service companies

50:30.760 --> 50:39.200
to distribute our software, it's not simple and I'm not really sure how to do partnerships

50:39.200 --> 50:40.840
with cloud companies.

50:40.840 --> 50:46.920
Cloud companies can be very tempted to just reuse all the open source software available

50:46.920 --> 50:56.840
and sell it and not fund in any way the software that are in these offers and we need a model

50:56.840 --> 51:05.760
for that so if we want to separate the work of cloud service and of software we need to

51:05.760 --> 51:14.560
find a model to how to sell open source software when it's sold to companies otherwise the

51:14.560 --> 51:20.360
software will not be able to fund themselves so Matrix for example has made a blog post

51:20.360 --> 51:28.000
about the fact that they have major success in terms of usage and deployments but many

51:28.000 --> 51:33.760
of these deployments are made by other companies that are making money off of it and are not

51:33.760 --> 51:40.840
giving back anything, not even developers to work on the project, neither funding, neither

51:40.840 --> 51:49.840
developers and in the end they had to fire people and so in order to, I mean if you want

51:49.840 --> 51:54.520
to do good software you need great people, you need great developers and so you need

51:54.520 --> 51:59.120
to find a funding model that works.

51:59.120 --> 52:06.480
One aspect for open source company is to work with less cash so I don't believe in VC investment

52:06.480 --> 52:12.880
because I think that doesn't allow to keep the independence of what we build but you

52:12.880 --> 52:20.440
have to work with less cash so even when you're growing it's difficult to hire because you

52:20.440 --> 52:26.400
need a lot of cash to run the company itself like to advance the money and you are taking

52:26.400 --> 52:30.880
risks and it's not a simple problem.

52:30.880 --> 52:36.360
Another problem is integration and fragmentation so clients want things that are integrated

52:36.360 --> 52:42.480
that's actually also one of the reasons you start to see packages that bundle the software

52:42.480 --> 52:49.520
so trying to make them all installable together easily that's actually something that's important

52:49.520 --> 52:56.080
and cloud providers providing multiple software together.

52:56.080 --> 53:02.880
This is very interesting but there is a lot of integration work that is necessary and

53:02.880 --> 53:11.120
sometimes that work is not brought back to the project and we need to make that happen.

53:11.120 --> 53:16.040
There's also a lot of fragmentation in the EU market so you need to go to multiple countries

53:16.040 --> 53:22.440
to sell it takes a lot of time so we need also partnerships between the companies in

53:22.440 --> 53:30.200
the different countries to work together in order to make that work and I'm very happy

53:30.200 --> 53:37.880
to have partnerships with Univention for example because for us it's a major win of

53:37.880 --> 53:42.560
time to go on the German market.

53:42.560 --> 53:49.640
If a company says look at this French company it changes a lot the way the German market

53:49.640 --> 53:55.240
will see a French company and that is going to be true the other way so we need to work

53:55.240 --> 54:03.760
more together so that's a bit the next step I have and so first is we need to believe

54:03.760 --> 54:09.680
in ourselves so we have great offers and the companies that are building software open

54:09.680 --> 54:16.720
source software are able to make it and the difficulties sometimes they have is about competition

54:16.720 --> 54:22.880
is about being considered good enough so that a lot of companies invest in them there is

54:22.880 --> 54:30.640
a huge amount of money sold on collaboration like I think we count billions of euros that

54:30.640 --> 54:36.720
are given to Microsoft and Google and if we sum all the open source companies we are talking

54:36.720 --> 54:44.360
about we are talking about 50, 100 million something like that revenue I don't know exactly

54:44.360 --> 54:50.560
because it's not always easy to get the numbers but we're spending billions on collaboration

54:50.560 --> 54:57.840
software from America to American companies so there is a lot of money it's just we need

54:57.840 --> 55:06.840
to convince the clients that we're good enough as a group not only as individual company

55:06.840 --> 55:12.360
and open source provides good openness and flexibility and that's useful to clients so

55:12.360 --> 55:18.640
there are also good technical arguments for open source when it comes to company we have

55:18.640 --> 55:25.760
had a lot of clients that were very interested in the flexibility of our software but they

55:25.760 --> 55:34.000
also want easy to go solution one provided to buy from and that's a real difficulty

55:34.000 --> 55:39.360
we need to work more on European collaborations I talked about it so at Xwiki this is something

55:39.360 --> 55:45.480
we're trying to do more so the Univention partnership we did last year and we're also

55:45.480 --> 55:50.440
looking at the partnerships with NextCloud with OpenProject where there are multiple

55:50.440 --> 55:56.600
companies in Europe that think the same way they just lack a lot of time to actually make

55:56.600 --> 56:05.920
it happen and so it's going to take time but there are many companies that want to do that

56:05.920 --> 56:13.920
and the sovereign workplace project is really great to create also this integrated offer

56:13.920 --> 56:21.360
bring the providers together now we will need to find ways to do partnerships with cloud

56:21.360 --> 56:27.240
providers I've yet to see how this will happen and we need more open standards that's also

56:27.240 --> 56:34.120
another aspect that's transversal we need more open standards I've also been a believer

56:34.120 --> 56:40.240
that we need an open source marketplace so a way for cloud providers to sell open source

56:40.240 --> 56:49.520
software in one easy way but it's it I thought I hope that GaiaX would be a place for that

56:49.520 --> 56:57.080
I haven't seen that that happening and we the most important thing we need is clients

56:57.080 --> 57:02.840
so any any clients that are brought to the companies that are providing this alternate

57:02.840 --> 57:09.560
platform are helping these companies bring the software a little bit better and it makes

57:09.560 --> 57:18.000
a difference so everything that as individual you can do to tell your your boss employers

57:18.000 --> 57:23.000
and that maybe they should look at what these companies are doing that other companies are

57:23.000 --> 57:31.160
actually deploying the software is is helping so I mean if you can help us do it and make

57:31.160 --> 57:49.080
it known and that's it if there are any questions think there's two minutes left so everybody

57:49.080 --> 57:56.200
fall asleep one hi you mentioned earlier in your talk that the French government deemed

57:56.200 --> 58:02.840
it illegal to host data on American companies because of the US cloud act could you expand

58:02.840 --> 58:09.520
on the cloud act a bit more yeah so the cloud act is the fact that the US government is

58:09.520 --> 58:21.160
able to access data on from American companies and even from American people so first I'm

58:21.160 --> 58:32.040
not a lawyer okay so don't don't take everything I say for granted so it allows to access data

58:32.040 --> 58:38.360
even if that data is in a foreign country so and and they can even I understood from

58:38.360 --> 58:47.120
a paper in Holland by lawyers that they could even ask to an American person secretly to

58:47.120 --> 58:54.880
get give the data that these people can access and and and they cannot refuse basically like

58:54.880 --> 59:01.200
they risk a lot so Microsoft if asked would secretly have to give money that they have

59:01.200 --> 59:08.920
on servers in Ireland and that is and that is not compliant with GDPR that's that's what

59:08.920 --> 59:16.880
the Max Schrempf judgment said so it's been written but then the problem is that they

59:16.880 --> 59:23.400
it needs to be recognized and decisions need to be made to stop doing it and and and it

59:23.400 --> 59:29.480
seems that it takes and and it seems like everybody's waiting for Europe to sign another

59:29.480 --> 59:36.080
agreement to say that it's okay so that you don't have to make the decision to stop hosting

59:36.080 --> 59:44.800
it on American systems please hi thanks for the the presentation so you were saying that

59:44.800 --> 59:52.120
actually like open source collaborative software would help solve the the issue or improve the

59:52.120 --> 01:00:00.080
digital sovereignty if we suppose that Microsoft tomorrow makes office source code available

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:08.040
on GitHub let's say how that how that change the the actual stage of the digital sovereignty

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:14.000
in the EU well it will change it if people start to to take that software and host it

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.800
and verify that it solves the business needs so but yes it would it would improve it for

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.480
example Microsoft does not give the source code of office so if you want to do office

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.640
editing you have to work with software that has been built by other people not by Microsoft

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:35.280
and Microsoft and Google have better software more compatible with office formats and so

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.920
on and so on so it would improve it still would need to be packaged there will still

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:46.400
be a lot of work but it would improve the offers the alternative offers and then companies

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:52.920
but so about the digital sovereignty the thing is if if tomorrow we have a political problem

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.840
they can turn off the software so all our companies will have problems the question

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:02.120
is okay do we have alternatives to replace that software at this point they're not necessarily

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:07.040
as good and they are not as good because we're not buying these alternatives so we we cannot

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.480
fund them so the distance between the American solutions and the European solution is increasing

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:18.440
instead of being reduced and so it's all about whether or not we would be able to replace

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:25.000
that software if Microsoft made it open source it would be easier to replace to replace their

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:32.760
own services their online services sorry I want a bit follow-up to the first question

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:46.200
basically so US Cloud Act regarding it as far as they recall privacy shield was the first

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:53.400
one that has been taken down by your court and I'm not sure if like US Cloud Act somehow

01:01:53.400 --> 01:02:01.000
replaces it or not because no no privacy the cloud is an American law the cloud that makes

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.040
it a problem that makes privacy shield illegal basically privacy shield said it's okay to

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:16.560
put data in in in the US and basically the judgment the from Mike shrimps go see his website

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:22.200
to explain he explains the problem much more precisely says that this is not true privacy

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:28.160
shield says it's okay but it's not okay because of the cloud act and the visa visa warrants

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:34.880
the laws in the US that allow access to data even if it's hosted in Europe yeah yeah and

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:41.000
European court accepted that privacy shield is not valid it's not a couple of years I

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.280
believe now the European government is right now negotiating the Commission is negotiating

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:55.720
with Biden some new paper that says it would be okay but it's already kind of validated

01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:02.080
that this paper is not okay that it wouldn't but there will need to be another judgment

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.360
to say that it's not okay so it's a kind of a cat and mouse because some people in Europe

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:14.440
don't want it to be illegal to use American system and Biden doesn't want to change the

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:32.920
cloud act thank you.
