The speaker presented Tableau Noir, an online and offline blackboard tool for teaching and presenting ideas. Tableau Noir was created in response to the limitations and unmet needs of existing online whiteboard solutions. The tool is designed for simplicity and usability, and features include manettes for interactive drawings, collaborative board sharing, and the ability to make presentations with animations. Tableau Noir is publicly available on its GitHub page and is written in TypeScript using Node.js for the server. The speaker invited the audience to discuss potential new features for the tool.
