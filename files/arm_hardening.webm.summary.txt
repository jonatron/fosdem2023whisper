The speaker, Zahra, works for Microsoft in the Linux Systems Group (LSG) and discusses an ongoing project on hardening the Linux kernel with architecture capabilities related to security. They explain that operating systems are complex, and fully hardening a kernel is still an open problem. They discuss the use of hardware security features and the Cherry project, which brings fine-grained memory safety and extensible compartmentalization to hardware architecture. They also highlight the Morello development board, which adds Cherry to ARM V8 and extends instructions and registers. They mention the current state of Morello Linux, the challenges they face, such as pointer mismatch, and the modifications made to enable security features. The speaker also discusses the importance of integrating software-defined permissions and fine-grained security features with Linux security subsystems. They emphasize that the project needs community involvement and feedback, particularly from the Linux community working on security subsystems. They mention the potential for redesigning secure stacks using fine-grained security features and invite those interested to contribute to the project. The talk concludes with a question and answer session.
