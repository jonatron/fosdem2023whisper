Joel Lappallianen, a developer on the OpenTrip planner and the Diki Transits projects, gave a presentation on the Diki Transits project at the FOSDEM conference in 2023. Diki Transits is an open-source project that does multimodal public transportation journey planning, and is used mostly in Finland, but also in Germany. The system consists of user interfaces, backend services, and open APIs. Lappallianen discussed the backend services being used, including the OpenTrip planner for routing and Pellias for geocoding, and presented the various user interface components, such as the front page, the itinerary views, and the stops near you page, which displays the departures for the stops near a particular location. The aim of the project is to replace legacy property journey planners, and the team is currently working on improving support for using OpenTrip planner version two, adding a map view to the stop monitor, and improving support for first and last mile services. The project could potentially expand to include Estonia, but there are issues with scaling for continental use.
